{"guideline_text": "Human serum albumin\nHuman serum albumin is the serum albumin found in human blood. It is the most abundant protein in human blood plasma; it constitutes about half of serum protein. It is produced in the liver. It is soluble in water and monomeric.\nAlbumin transports hormones, fatty acids, and other compounds, buffers pH, and maintains oncotic pressure, among other functions.\nAlbumin is synthesized in the liver as preproalbumin, which has an N-terminal peptide that is removed before the nascent protein is released from the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The product, proalbumin, is in turn cleaved in the Golgi vesicles to produce the secreted albumin.\nThe reference range for albumin concentrations in serum is approximately 35–50 g/L (3.5–5.0 g/dL).  It has a serum half-life of approximately 20 days. It has a molecular mass of 66.5 kDa.\nThe gene for albumin is located on chromosome 4 in locus 4q13.3 and mutations in this gene can result in anomalous proteins. The human albumin gene is 16,961 nucleotides long from the putative 'cap' site to the first poly(A) addition site. It is split into 15 exons that are symmetrically placed within the 3 domains thought to have arisen by triplication of a single primordial domain.\n\n# Function\n- Maintains oncotic pressure\n- Transports thyroid hormones\n- Transports other hormones, in particular, ones that are fat-soluble\n- Transports fatty acids (\"free\" fatty acids) to the liver and to myocytes for utilization of energy\n- Transports unconjugated bilirubin\n- Transports many drugs; serum albumin levels can affect the half-life of drugs\n- Competitively binds calcium ions (Ca2+)\n- Serum albumin, as a negative acute-phase protein, is down-regulated in inflammatory states. As such, it is not a valid marker of nutritional status; rather, it is a marker of an inflammatory state\n- Prevents photodegradation of folic acid\n\n# Measurement\nSerum albumin is commonly measured by recording the change in absorbance upon binding to a dye such as bromocresol green or bromocresol purple.\n\n# Reference ranges\nSerum albumin concentration is typically 35–50 g/L (3.5–5.0 g/dL).\n\n# Pathology\n\n## Hypoalbuminemia\nHypoalbuminemia means low blood albumin levels. This can be caused by:\n- Liver disease; cirrhosis of the liver is most common\n- Excess excretion by the kidneys (as in nephrotic syndrome)\n- Excess loss in bowel (protein-losing enteropathy, e.g., Ménétrier's disease)\n- Burns (plasma loss in the absence of skin barrier)\n- Redistribution (hemodilution , increased vascular permeability or decreased lymphatic clearance)\n- Acute disease states (referred to as a negative acute-phase protein)\n- Malnutrition and wasting\n- Mutation causing analbuminemia (very rare)\n\n## Hyperalbuminemia\nHyperalbuminemia is an increased concentration of albumin in the blood. Typically, this condition is due to dehydration.  Hyperalbuminemia has also been associated with high protein diets.\n\n## Therapeutic uses\nHuman albumin solution or HSA is available for medical use, usually at concentrations of 5–25%.\nHuman albumin is often used to replace lost fluid and help restore blood volume in trauma, burns and surgery patients. A Cochrane systematic review of 37 trials found no evidence that albumin, compared with cheaper alternatives such as saline, reduces the risk of dying.\nHuman serum albumin has been used as a component of a frailty index.\nIt has not been shown to give better results than other fluids when used simply to replace volume, but is frequently used in conditions where loss of albumin is a major problem, such as liver disease with ascites.\nHuman serum albumin may be used to potentially reverse drug/chemical toxicity by binding to free drug/agent. (Tatlow, D, Poothencheri, S, Bhangal, R and Tatlow C. Novel method for rapid reversal of drug toxicity: A case report. doi|10.1111/1440-1681.12358). Ascentzi, P, Leboffe, L, Toti, D, Polticelli, F, and Trezza, V. Fipronil recognition by the FA1 site of human serum albumin. doi|10.1002/jmr.2713.\n\n# Glycation\nIt has been known for a long time that human blood proteins like hemoglobin  and serum albumin may undergo a slow non-enzymatic glycation, mainly by formation of a Schiff base between ε-amino groups of lysine (and sometimes arginine) residues and glucose molecules in blood (Maillard reaction). This reaction can be inhibited in the presence of antioxidant agents. Although this reaction may happen normally, elevated glycoalbumin is observed in diabetes mellitus.\nGlycation has the potential to alter the biological structure and function of the serum albumin protein.\nMoreover, the glycation can result in the formation of Advanced Glycation End-Products (AGE), which result in abnormal biological effects. Accumulation of AGEs leads to tissue damage via alteration of the structures and functions of tissue proteins, stimulation of cellular responses, through receptors specific for AGE-proteins, and generation of reactive oxygen intermediates. AGEs also react with DNA, thus causing mutations and DNA transposition. Thermal processing of proteins and carbohydrates brings major changes in allergenicity. AGEs are antigenic and represent many of the important neoantigens found in cooked or stored foods. They also interfere with the normal product of nitric oxide in cells.\nAlthough there are several lysine and arginine residues in the serum albumin structure, very few of them can take part in the glycation reaction. It is not clear exactly why only these residues are glycated in serum albumin, but it is suggested that non-covalent binding of glucose to serum albumin prior to the covalent bond formation might be the reason.\n\n# Oxidation\nThe albumin is the predominant protein in most body fluids, its Cys34 represents the largest fraction of free thiols within body. The albumin Cys34 thiol exists in both reduced and oxidized forms. In plasma of healthy young adults, 70–80% of total HSA contains the free sulfhydryl group of Cys34 in a reduced form or mercaptoalbumin (HSA-SH). However, in pathological states characterized by oxidative stress and during the aging process, the oxidized form, or non-mercaptoalbumin (HNA), could predominate. The albumin thiol reacts with radical hydroxyl (.OH), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and the reactive nitrogen species as peroxynitrite (ONOO.), and have been shown to oxidize Cys34 to sulfenic acid derivate (HSA-SOH), it can be recycled to mercapto-albumin; however at high concentrations of reactive species leads to the irreversible oxidation to sulfinic (HSA-SO2H) or sulfonic acid (HSA-SO3H) affecting its structure.  Presence of reactive oxygen species (ROS), can induce irreversible structural damage and alter protein activities.\n\n# Loss via kidneys\nIn the healthy kidney, albumin's size and negative electric charge exclude it from excretion in the glomerulus. This is not always the case, as in some diseases including diabetic nephropathy, which can sometimes be a complication of uncontrolled or of longer term diabetes  in which proteins can cross the glomerulus. The lost albumin can be detected by a simple urine test. Depending on the amount of albumin lost, a patient may have normal renal function, microalbuminuria, or albuminuria.\n\n# Amino acid sequence\nThe approximate sequence of human serum albumin is:\nMKWVTFISLL FLFSSAYSRG VFRRDAHKSE VAHRFKDLGE ENFKALVLIA FAQYLQQCPF EDHVKLVNEV TEFAKTCVAD ESAENCDKSL HTLFGDKLCT VATLRETYGE MADCCAKQEP ERNECFLQHK DDNPNLPRLV RPEVDVMCTA FHDNEETFLK KYLYEIARRH PYFYAPELLF FAKRYKAAFT ECCQAADKAA CLLPKLDELR DEGKASSAKQ RLKCASLQKF GERAFKAWAV ARLSQRFPKA EFAEVSKLVT DLTKVHTECC HGDLLECADD RADLAKYICE NQDSISSKLK ECCEKPLLEK SHCIAEVEND EMPADLPSLA ADFVESKDVC KNYAEAKDVF LGMFLYEYAR RHPDYSVVLL LRLAKTYETT LEKCCAAADP HECYAKVFDE FKPLVEEPQN LIKQNCELFE QLGEYKFQNA LLVRYTKKVP QVSTPTLVEV SRNLGKVGSK CCKHPEAKRM PCAEDYLSVV LNQLCVLHEK TPVSDRVTKC CTESLVNRRP CFSALEVDET YVPKEFNAET FTFHADICTL SEKERQIKKQ TALVELVKHK PKATKEQLKA VMDDFAAFVE KCCKADDKET CFAEEGKKLV AASQAALGL\nOf the 609 amino acids in this sequence, encoded by the ALB gene and translated to form the precursor protein, only 585 amino acids are observed in the final product present in the blood; the first 24 amino acids (here italicized), including the signal peptide (1–18) and propeptide (19–22, or 19–24) portions, are cleaved after translation.\n\n# Interactions\nHuman serum albumin has been shown to interact with FCGRT.", "source": "wikidoc", "question": "According to authoritative guidelines, discuss when human serum albumin should be used in clinical practice for volume replacement and other indications (for example trauma, burns, cirrhosis with ascites, nephrotic syndrome, and suspected drug/chemical toxicity), including the physiological rationale for its use, the evidence regarding mortality or outcome benefit compared with cheaper alternatives such as saline, and how to integrate effectiveness, potential harms, and cost-effectiveness into your decision-making."}
{"guideline_text": "Farnesyltransferase inhibitor\nThe farnesyltransferase inhibitors (FTIs) are a class of experimental cancer drugs that target protein farnesyltransferase with the downstream effect of preventing the proper functioning of the Ras protein, which is commonly abnormally active in cancer.\n\n# Background\nStudies have suggested that interference with certain post-translational modification processes seem to have quite a high selectivity for targeting cells displaying tumour phenotypes although the reason for this is a matter of controversy (as will be explained below).\nAfter translation, RAS goes through four steps of modification: isoprenylation, proteolysis, methylation and palmitoylation. Isoprenylation involves the enzyme farnesyltransferase (FTase) transferring a farnesyl group from farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) to the pre-RAS protein. Also, a related enzyme geranylgeranyltransferase I (GGTase I) has the ability to transfer a geranylgeranyl group to K and N-RAS (the implications of this are discussed below). Farnesyl is necessary to attach RAS to the cell membrane. Without attachment to the cell membrane, RAS is not able to transfer signals from membrane receptors (Reuter et al., 2000).\n\n# Development of FTIs\nAfter a program of high-throughput screening of a class of drugs targeting the first step, the farnesyltransferase inhibitors (FTIs) were developed (Reuter et al., 2000). A number of molecules were found to have FTI activity. Some earlier compounds were found to have major side effects, and their development was discontinued. The others have entered clinical trials for different cancers. SCH66336 (Lonafarnib) was the first to do so, followed by R115777 (Zarnestra, Tipifarnib) (Caponigro et al., 2003).\nUnfortunately, the predicted “early potential  has not been realised” (Downward J, 2003). The anti-tumour properties of FTIs were attributed to their action on RAS processing; however this assumption has now been questioned. Of the three members (H, N and K) of the RAS family, K-RAS is the form found most often mutated in cancer. As noted above, as well as modification by FFTase an alternative route to creation of biologically active RAS is through GGTase modification. When FFTase is blocked by FFTase inhibitors this pathway comes in to operation – both K and N-RAS are able to be activated through this mechanism. In recognition of this a joint administration of FTIs and GTIs was tried, however this resulted in high toxicity. It is in fact thought that the lack of FTI toxicity may be due to a failure to fully inhibit RAS: FTIs actually target normal cells but alternative pathway allow these cells to surive (Downward J, 2003).\n\n# Explaining success\nSo how to explain the preclinical successes showing that many N- or K-RAS transformed cell lines (and even tumor cell lines that do not harbor RAS mutations) are sensitive to FTase inhibitors? It has been suggested that this is due to inhibition of farnesylation of a number of other proteins (Reuter et al., 2000). Therefore it is hoped that FTIs, whilst not RAS specific, still have potential for cancer therapy.\n\n# Products in Development\nTipifarnib\nLonafarnib\n\n# Investigation of FTIs for alternative uses\n\n## FTIs and protozoan parasites\nFTIs can also be used to inhibit farnesylation in parasites such as Trypanosoma brucei (African sleeping sickness) and Plasmodium falciparum (malaria). Interestingly, these parasites seem to be more vulnerable to inhibition of Farnesyltransferase than humans, even though the drugs tested selectively target human FTase. In some cases the reason for this may be the parasites lack Geranylgeranyltransferase I. This vulnerability may pave the way for the development of selective, low toxicity, FTI based anti-parasitic drugs 'piggybacking' on the development of FTIs for cancer research.\n\n## Use with Progeria\nRecently studies have been published indicating that farnesyltransferase inhibitors can act to reverse instability of nuclear structure due to the genetic mutation of the LMNA gene. It is being tested as a potential drug treatment in children suffering from Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome.", "source": "wikidoc", "question": "According to authoritative guidelines, discuss the rationale and mechanism of action of farnesyltransferase inhibitors in cancer therapy, summarize the key findings from their clinical development (including reasons for limited efficacy and toxicity when combined with geranylgeranyltransferase inhibitors), and outline the plausible alternative clinical applications suggested by preclinical data (such as antiparasitic use and treatment of Hutchinson‑Gilford progeria), integrating how these mechanistic and safety considerations should guide clinical use and further development."}
{"guideline_text": "Coccidioidomycosis overview\n\n# Overview\nCoccidioidomycosis  is a fungal disease caused by Coccidioides immitis or C. posadasii. It can be caused by breathing coccidioides spores in the air, especially after a soil disturbance. As per CDC  about 30-60 % people living in endemic areas are exposed to the infection sometimes in their lives.\n\n# Historical Perspective\nCoccidioidomycosis was first discovered in 1892 by, Alejandro Posadas (a medical student) along with his mentor. They grouped coccidioidomycosis under parasitic family. Emmet Rixford and T. Caspar Gilchrist coined the term coccidioidomycosis (resembling coccidia) in 1896. William Ophüls and Herbert C. Moffitt described its dimorphic nature and defined it as a fungal etiology in 1900. C. immitis was investigated by the United States during the 1950s and 1960s as a potential biological weapon. It was never standardized, around beyond a few field trials, it was never weaponized.\n\n# Pathophysiology\nCoccidioidomycosis is a fungal infection, that is acquired through inhalation of the spores from the environment. Following inhalation, the spores gets deposited into terminal bronchioles and enlarge, become rounded and develop internal septations to form what are known as the spherules. It then disseminates through the lymphatics and blood stream to gain access to any organ of the body.\n\n# Causes\nCoccidioidomycosis is caused by an infection with Coccidioides immitis or Coccidioides posadasii\n\n# Epidemiology and Demographics\nCalifornia state prisons have been particularly affected by Coccidioidomycosis, as far back as 1919. In 2005 and 2006, the Pleasant Valley State Prison near Coalinga and Avenal State Prison near Avenal on the western side of the San Joaquin Valley had the highest incidence rate in 2005, of at least 3,000 per 100,000.\nIt is endemic in certain parts of Arizona, California, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, Utah and northwestern Mexico.\n\n# Differentiating Coccidioidomycosis from other Diseases\nCoccidioidomycosis presents as a mild flu-like illness that needs to be differentiated from a number of other fungal/bacterial disorders. These disorders have overlapping signs & symptoms such as fever, muscle pain along with rash that often needs detailed history, physical examination, and serological tests to pinpoint the diagnosis. Blastomycosis, Histoplasmosis, Aspergillosis, Pneumocystis pneumonia, Sporotrichosis.\n\n# Risk Factors\nOn occasion, those particularly susceptible, including pregnant women, people with weakened immune systems, and those of Asian, Hispanic and African descent, may develop a serious or even fatal illness from valley fever.\n\n# Natural History, Complications and Prognosis\n\n## Natural History\nSymptomatic infection (40% of cases) usually presents as an influenza-like illness with fever, cough, headaches, rash, and myalgia. Some patients fail to recover and develop chronic pulmonary infection or widespread disseminated infection (affecting meninges, soft tissues, joints, and bone). Severe pulmonary disease may develop in HIV-infected persons.\n\n## Complications\nSerious complications include severe pneumonia, lung nodules, and disseminated disease, where the fungus spreads throughout the body.  The disseminated form of valley fever can devastate the body, causing skin ulcers and abscesses to bone lesions, severe joint pain, pericarditis, prostatitis,urinary tract infection, meningitis, and death.\n\n## Prognosis\nThe prognosis of  Coccidioidomycosis is good in immunocompetent patients. It is self-limited in most of the patients and recovery is without any complications. The mortality rate is currently <0.07%. Approximately less than 1 % of patients develop disseminated coccidioidomycosis.\n\n# Diagnosis\n\n## Symptoms\nA positive history of fever, arthralgia and erythema nodosum are suggestive of coccidioidomycosis. The most common symptoms of coccidioidomycosis include fever with chills, cough, and pleuritic chest pain.\n\n## Physical Examination\nThe physical manifestations of the disease depends on the organ of involvement. In the order of incidence the most commonly involved organs are lungs, skin, bones, genitourinary system, central nervous system and other organs.\n\n## Laboratory Findings\nThe fungal infection can be demonstrated by microscopic detection of diagnostic cells in body fluids, exudates, sputum and biopsy-tissue. With specific nucleotide primers C.immitis DNA can be amplified by PCR. It can also be detected in culture by morphological identification or by using molecular probes that hybridize with C.immitis RNA. An indirect demonstration of fungal infection can be achieved also by serologic analysis detecting fungal antigen or host antibody produced against the fungus.\n\n## Chest Xray\nEvery patient suspected of coccidioides infection needs a chest X-ray. The findings can be variable ranging from infiltrates, nodules, cavities to mediastinal adenopathy and pleural effusions. Nodules in the upper part of the lung is a usual finding, they are rarely calcified if at all. The nodules are better visualized on CT scan and after contrast enhancement\n\n# Treatment\nAntifungals are the mainstay of treatment. The drug therapy is guided by the severity of symptoms and the immune status of the patient. Since most patients are asymptomatic or mildly affected, no treatment or a single drug azole therapy (fluconazole or itraconazole) may be sufficient in these cases. More recently resistant cases are being treated with voriconazole or posaconazole.. However, patients with HIV, immunocompromised, those on steroids or pregnant females need much more aggressive approach. More severe cases may require intravenous amphotericin B, with or without simultaneous oral azole therapy. Meningitis or vasculitis often need initial in-patient treatment with oral azoles plus intravenous amphotericin B with or without intrathecal amphotericin B. Untreated cases may sometimes be fatal.", "source": "wikidoc", "question": "According to authoritative guidelines, outline a structured approach to the diagnosis and management of a patient with suspected coccidioidomycosis, including which clinical features and investigations should prompt chest imaging and serologic/microbiologic testing, how to stratify patients by severity and host risk factors (e.g., pregnancy, HIV, immunosuppression, race), and how these factors determine choice and intensity of antifungal therapy (no treatment vs oral azole versus intravenous amphotericin B, including management of meningitis and disseminated disease)."}
{"guideline_text": "Tiotropium Oral Inhalation (patient information)\n\n# Why is this medication prescribed\nTiotropium is used to prevent wheezing, shortness of breath, and difficulty breathing in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD, a group of diseases that affect the lungs and airways) such as chronic bronchitis (swelling of the air passages that lead to the lungs) and emphysema (damage to air sacs in the lungs). Tiotropium is in a class of medications called bronchodilators. It works by relaxing and opening the air passages to the lungs to make breathing easier.\n\n# How should this medicine be used\nTiotropium comes as a capsule to use with a specially designed inhaler. You will use the inhaler to breathe in the dry powder contained in the capsules. Tiotropium is usually inhaled once a day in the morning or evening. To help you remember to inhale tiotropium, inhale it around the same time every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use tiotropium exactly as directed. Do not inhale more or less of it or inhale it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\nTiotropium will only work if you use the inhaler it comes with to inhale the powder in the capsules. Never swallow tiotropium capsules and never try to inhale them using any other inhaler. Never use your tiotropium inhaler to take any other medication.\nDo not use tiotropium to treat a sudden attack of wheezing or shortness of breath. Your doctor will probably prescribe a different medication to use when you have great difficulty breathing.\nTiotropium controls COPD but does not cure it. It may take a few weeks before you feel the full benefits of tiotropium. Continue to take tiotropium even if you feel well. Do not stop taking tiotropium without talking to your doctor.\nBe careful not to get tiotropium powder in your eyes. If tiotropium powder gets into your eyes, your vision may become blurred and you may be sensitive to light. Call your doctor if this happens.\nTo use the inhaler, follow these steps:\n- Use the diagram in the patient information that came with your medication to help you learn the names of the parts of your inhaler. You should be able to find the dust cap, mouthpiece, base, piercing button, and center chamber.\n- Pick up one blister card of tiotropium capsules and tear it along the perforation. You should now have two strips that each contain three capsules.\n- Put away one of the strips for later. Use the tab to carefully peel back the foil on the other blister strip until the STOP line. This should fully uncover one capsule. The other two capsules on the strip should still be sealed in their packaging. *Plan to use those capsules on the next 2 days.\n- Pull upward on the dust cap of your inhaler to open it.\n- Open the mouthpiece of the inhaler. Remove the tiotropium capsule from the package and place it in the center chamber of the inhaler.\n- Close the mouthpiece firmly until it clicks, but do not close the dust cap.\n- Hold the inhaler so that the mouthpiece is on top. Press the green piercing button once, then let it go.\n- Breathe out completely without putting any part of the inhaler in or near your mouth.\n- Bring the inhaler up to your mouth and close your lips tightly around the mouthpiece.\n- Hold your head upright and breathe in slowly and deeply. You should breathe just fast enough to hear the capsule vibrate. *Continue to breathe in until your lungs are full.\n- Hold your breath for as long as you can comfortably do so. Take the inhaler out of your mouth while you are holding your breath.\n- Breathe normally for a short time.\n- Repeat steps 8-11 to inhale any medication that may be left in your inhaler.\n- Open the mouthpiece and tilt the inhaler to spill out the used capsule. Throw the used capsule away out of the reach of children and pets. You may see a small amount of powder remaining in the capsule. This is normal and does not mean that you did not get your full dose.\n- Close the mouthpiece and dust cap and store the inhaler in a safe place.\n\n# Other uses for this medicine\nThis medication may be prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.\n\n# What special precautions should I follow\nBefore using tiotropium\n- tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to tiotropium, atropine (Atropen, Sal-Tropine, Ocu-Tropine), ipratropium (Atrovent), or any other medications.\n- tell your doctor and pharmacist what prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking.

It is caused by dysfunction of the heart due to muscle damage (systolic or diastolic dysfunction), valvular dysfunction, arrhythmias or other rare causes. Acute heart failure can present as new‑onset heart failure in people without known cardiac dysfunction, or as acute decompensation of chronic heart failure.\nAcute heart failure is a common cause of admission to hospital (over 67,000 admissions in England and Wales per year) and is the leading cause of hospital admission in people 65 years or older in the UK.\nThis guideline includes important aspects of the diagnosis and management of acute heart failure that are not addressed by the NICE guideline on chronic heart failure. The guideline on chronic heart failure focuses on long‑term management rather than on the immediate care of someone who is acutely unwell as a result of heart failure.\nThis guideline covers the care of adults (aged 18 years or older) who have a diagnosis of acute heart failure, have possible acute heart failure, or are being investigated for acute heart failure. It includes the following key clinical areas:\nthe role of early natriuretic peptide testing and echocardiography\nthe role of specialist management units\nthe use of ventilatory support, pharmacological therapy and ultrafiltration\ntreatment after stabilisation, including selected surgical interventions and initiation of the pharmacological therapies that are used in the management of chronic heart failure.\n\n# Drug recommendations\nThe guideline will assume that prescribers will use a drug's summary of product characteristics to inform decisions made with individual patients.\nIn memory of Christopher Jones, patient member of the GDG who ensured that the patient voice was heard during the development of this guideline.# Recommendations\nPeople have the right to be involved in discussions and make informed decisions about their care, as described in NICE's information on making decisions about your care.\nMaking decisions using NICE guidelines explains how we use words to show the strength (or certainty) of our recommendations, and has information about prescribing medicines (including off-label use), professional guidelines, standards and laws (including on consent and mental capacity), and safeguarding.\nThe following guidance is based on the best available evidence. The full guideline gives details of the methods and the evidence used to develop the guidance.\n\n# Organisation of care\nAll hospitals admitting people with suspected acute heart failure should provide a specialist heart failure team that is based on a cardiology ward and provides outreach services.\nEnsure that all people being admitted to hospital with suspected acute heart failure have early and continuing input from a dedicated specialist heart failure team.\nPlan the following with people with acute heart failure in line with the NICE guideline on chronic heart failure:\ndischarge from hospital after the acute phase and\nsubsequent management in primary care, including ongoing monitoring and care provided by the multidisciplinary team and\ninformation and communication about their condition, its treatment and prognosis.\nA follow‑up clinical assessment should be undertaken by a member of the specialist heart failure team within 2 weeks of the person being discharged from hospital.\n\n# Diagnosis, assessment and monitoring\nTake a history, perform a clinical examination and undertake standard investigations – for example, electrocardiography, chest X‑ray and blood tests – in line with the NICE guideline on chronic heart failure.\nIn people presenting with new suspected acute heart failure, use a single measurement of serum natriuretic peptides (B‑type natriuretic peptide  or N‑terminal pro‑B‑type natriuretic peptide ) and the following thresholds to rule out the diagnosis of heart failure:\nBNP less than 100 ng/litre\nNT‑proBNP less than 300 ng/litre.\nIn people presenting with new suspected acute heart failure with raised natriuretic peptide levels (see recommendation 1.2.2), perform transthoracic Doppler 2D echocardiography to establish the presence or absence of cardiac abnormalities.\nIn people presenting with new suspected acute heart failure, consider performing transthoracic Doppler 2D echocardiography within 48 hours of admission to guide early specialist management.\nDo not routinely offer pulmonary artery catheterisation to people with acute heart failure.\n\n# Initial pharmacological treatment\nFor guidance on patient consent and capacity follow recommendations on consent and capacity in the NICE guideline on patient experience in adult NHS services.\nDo not routinely offer opiates to people with acute heart failure.\nOffer intravenous diuretic therapy to people with acute heart failure. Start treatment using either a bolus or infusion strategy.\nFor people already taking a diuretic, consider a higher dose of diuretic than that on which the person was admitted unless there are serious concerns with patient adherence to diuretic therapy before admission.\nClosely monitor the person's renal function, weight and urine output during diuretic therapy.\nDiscuss with the person the best strategies of coping with an increased urine output.\nDo not routinely offer nitrates to people with acute heart failure.\nIf intravenous nitrates are used in specific circumstances, such as for people with concomitant myocardial ischaemia, severe hypertension or regurgitant aortic or mitral valve disease, monitor blood pressure closely in a setting where at least level 2 care can be provided.\nDo not offer sodium nitroprusside to people with acute heart failure.\nDo not routinely offer inotropes or vasopressors to people with acute heart failure.\nConsider inotropes or vasopressors in people with acute heart failure with potentially reversible cardiogenic shock. Administer these treatments in a cardiac care unit or high dependency unit or an alternative setting where at least level 2 care can be provided.Level 2 care is for people needing more detailed observation or intervention, including support for a single failing organ system or postoperative care and for those stepping down from higher levels of care. From levels of critical care for adult patients.\n\n# Initial non-pharmacological treatment\nDo not routinely use non‑invasive ventilation (continuous positive airways pressure  or non‑invasive positive pressure ventilation ) in people with acute heart failure and cardiogenic pulmonary oedema.\nIf a person has cardiogenic pulmonary oedema with severe dyspnoea and acidaemia consider starting non‑invasive ventilation without delay:\nat acute presentation or\nas an adjunct to medical therapy if the person's condition has failed to respond.\nConsider invasive ventilation in people with acute heart failure that, despite treatment, is leading to or is complicated by:\nrespiratory failure or\nreduced consciousness or physical exhaustion.\nDo not routinely offer ultrafiltration to people with acute heart failure.\nConsider ultrafiltration for people with confirmed diuretic resistance.Diuretic resistance is defined as dose escalation beyond a person's previously recognised dose ceiling or a dose approaching the maximum recommended daily dose without incremental improvement in diuresis. From diuretics and ultrafiltration in acute decompensated heart failure.\n\n# Treatment after stabilisation\nIn a person presenting with acute heart failure who is already taking beta‑blockers, continue the beta‑blocker treatment unless they have a heart rate less than 50 beats per minute, second or third degree atrioventricular block, or shock.\nStart or restart beta‑blocker treatment during hospital admission in people with acute heart failure due to left ventricular systolic dysfunction, once their condition has been stabilised – for example, when intravenous diuretics are no longer needed.\nEnsure that the person's condition is stable for typically 48 hours after starting or restarting beta‑blockers and before discharging from hospital.\nOffer an angiotensin‑converting enzyme inhibitor (or angiotensin receptor blocker if there are intolerable side effects) and an aldosterone antagonist during hospital admission to people with acute heart failure and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction. If the angiotensin‑converting enzyme inhibitor (or angiotensin receptor blocker) is not tolerated an aldosterone antagonist should still be offered.In February 2016, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) published advice on the concomitant use of spironolactone and renin-angiotensin system drugs in heart failure concerning the risk of potentially fatal hyperkalaemia. See the MHRA advice for more information.\nClosely monitor the person's renal function, electrolytes, heart rate, blood pressure and overall clinical status during treatment with beta‑blockers, aldosterone antagonists or angiotensin‑converting enzyme inhibitors.\n\n# Valvular surgery and percutaneous intervention\nThe recommendations on valvular surgery and percutaneous intervention have been replaced by the NICE guideline on heart valve disease.\n\n# Mechanical assist devices\nAt an early stage, the specialist should have a discussion with a centre providing mechanical circulatory support about:\npeople with potentially reversible severe acute heart failure or\npeople who are potential candidates for transplantation.# Recommendations for research\nThe Guideline Development Group has made the following recommendations for research, based on its review of evidence, to improve NICE guidance and patient care in the future.\n\n# Dopamine\nIn people with acute heart failure, congestion and worsening renal function, does the addition of low‑dose dopamine to standard therapy lead to greater diuresis and renal protection compared with adding placebo to standard therapy?\n\n## Why this is important\nA randomised controlled trial should be conducted to investigate whether the addition of low‑dose dopamine to standard therapy leads to more clinically and cost effective decongestion in people admitted to hospital for treatment of decompensated heart failure. The study should aim to investigate the diuretic effect of dopamine as well as effects on renal function.\nOne of the most common and difficult to manage problems arising during the initial treatment of people with acute heart failure is an inadequate response to intravenous diuretic therapy (that is, failure to relieve congestion), which is often associated with worsening renal function. This combination frequently leads to a prolonged inpatient stay and is associated with higher inpatient mortality rates and higher post‑discharge mortality and re‑admission rates. The best treatment for this combination of problems is unknown. However, theoretical and experimental evidence indicates that low‑dose dopamine may improve renal blood flow, as well as enhance sodium and water excretion. Clinical trials have not yet resolved whether in some patients, the use of low‑dose dopamine actually results in improved decongestion and shorter hospital stays.\n\n# Thiazide\nIn people with acute heart failure and persistent congestion, does the addition of a thiazide diuretic to standard therapy lead to greater diuresis compared with adding placebo to standard therapy?\n\n## Why this is important\nA randomised controlled trial should be conducted to investigate whether the addition of a thiazide diuretic to standard therapy leads to more clinically and cost effective decongestion in people admitted to hospital for treatment of decompensated heart failure.\nOne of the most common and difficult to manage problems arising during the initial treatment of people with acute heart failure is an inadequate response to intravenous diuretic therapy. This frequently leads to a prolonged inpatient stay and is associated with higher inpatient mortality and higher post‑discharge mortality and re‑admission rates. The best treatment for this problem is unknown. However, there is some inconsistent and non‑robust evidence that addition of a thiazide or thiazide‑like diuretic (metolazone) may be beneficial. The proposed study would aim to resolve this uncertainty and guide the management of a difficult clinical problem.\n\n# Intra-aortic balloon counter‑pulsation\nIn people with acute heart failure and hypoperfusion syndrome, is the use of intra‑aortic balloon counter‑pulsation pump (IABP) better than the use of intravenous inotropes?\n\n## Why this is important\nA randomised controlled trial should be conducted in people with decompensated heart failure due to left ventricular systolic dysfunction and systemic hypoperfusion comparing the use of IABP with the use of inotropes/vasopressors. This would determine which strategy is more clinically and cost effective in this cohort.\nIABP is used in the hospital setting as an adjuvant in people with critical coronary ischaemia and in people with mechanical complications of acute myocardial infarction. It has also been used in people who develop cardiogenic shock after acute myocardial infarction. However, it is uncertain whether it can provide clinical benefit in the critically unwell patients with acute heart failure due to left ventricular systolic dysfunction and systemic hypoperfusion.\n\n# Ultrafiltration\nIn people with decompensated heart failure, fluid congestion and diuretic resistance, does ultrafiltration lead to more rapid and effective decongestion compared with continuing diuretic treatment?\n\n## Why this is important\nA randomised controlled trial should be undertaken to determine whether ultrafiltration is more clinically and cost effective than conventional diuretic therapy for people admitted to hospital with decompensated heart failure. The study should not only investigate several clinical outcomes but also consider the impact of treatments on quality of life and provide data on safety.\nPeople who have fluid retention that is resistant to conventional diuretic therapy, with or without renal dysfunction, make up a high proportion of hospital admissions due to heart failure. Such admissions are often prolonged and therefore have important budgetary implications for the NHS. The few, relatively small scale, randomised trials of ultrafiltration performed so far have been conducted in healthcare settings very different from the UK, with less fluid retention than is usually seen in UK practice, and where length of stay is usually much shorter than in UK (and European) practice. Although technically feasible, the evidence for benefit on heart failure outcomes is inconsistent and difficult to generalise to UK practice. Therefore, a UK‑based study of sufficient quality is needed.", "source": "nice", "question": "According to the NICE guideline on acute heart failure, outline your approach to assessing and managing an adult who presents to hospital with new suspected acute heart failure, addressing (with rationale) the initial history/examination and investigations (including specific natriuretic peptide thresholds), the timing and role of transthoracic echocardiography, first‑line pharmacological and non‑pharmacological treatments (including monitoring and situations in which nitrates, inotropes/vasopressors, non‑invasive or invasive ventilation, or ultrafiltration should or should not be used), criteria for specialist escalation (including level 2 care, mechanical circulatory support discussion and cardiac care unit admission), and key elements of in‑hospital stabilization and early post‑discharge specialist follow‑up."}

{"guideline_text": "Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common subtype of Non-Hodgkin lymphoma in North America. While most patients often respond well to frontline treatment, there is a significant proportion of patients (30-40%) that will either be refractory to or relapse following frontline therapy. The standard of care for patients in the relapsed/refractory setting includes salvage therapy followed by high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) for patients whose disease demonstrate chemosensitivity and who are fit and transplant eligible. However, there is a group of patients that do not demonstrate chemosensitivity to salvage therapy, are ineligible for ASCT, or relapse post-SCT. For this group of patients, there are variable treatment options which may differ across the Canadian provinces due to access and funding. In Canada, no unified national guideline exists for the treatment of relapsed/refractory DLBCL, and the provincial guidelines in existence vary. A national treatment guideline supported by Canadian hematologists is warranted to ensure that patients with relapsed/refractory DLBCL are treated according to best practice and have equitable access to best available care. A group of experts from across Canada have developed a national evidence-based treatment guideline to provide healthcare professionals with clear guidance on the management of relapsed or refractory DLBCL. Results of the current provincial guidelines in existence are presented with consensus recommendations based on available evidence.# Introduction\nDiffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common type of Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and constitutes 30-40% of all Canadian NHL cases. DLBCL represents a heterogeneous group of aggressive B-cell malignancies that differ in prognosis, clinical and molecular features, and treatment options. Classifying patients by appropriate DLBCL subtype and accounting for additional risk factors are important in establishing the grade of aggressiveness of the lymphoma to determine prognosis. However, this is often difficult in practice and may not necessarily have implications on the treatment and management plan.\nDue to the aggressiveness of DLBCL, rapid diagnosis and initiation of frontline treatment are essential. There are specific recommendations for frontline treatment for Canadian DLBCL patients based on high-risk molecular features, central nervous system disease, and risk factors 1 . Following treatment with the standard frontline therapy R-CHOP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone), approximately 30-50% of treated patients will suffer from relapse or refractory disease 2 . For these patients, the standard approach is salvage chemotherapy followed by high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) for those who meet the eligibility criteria and have chemosensitive disease. In contrast, those who do not show chemosensitivity to salvage therapy are not transplant eligible. This group of patients, along with those who relapse following ASCT, are eligible for chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy. However, provincial funding currently varies and some patients are required to travel out of province or country to access CAR-T therapy. For those that are not eligible for CAR-T therapy or fail treatment, there is no standard treatment approach and treatment will depend on access to clinical trials as well as patientrelated factors. Across Canada, several barriers could hinder the availability and timely access to therapies. Such factors can include provincial funding decisions, number and availability of hematologists or oncologists within the province to provide timely access, and number and location of treatment centers. These barriers can result in inequities and delays in treatment for DLBCL patients, especially in the relapse/refractory setting where experimental treatment options may only be available in certain provinces and at certain hospitals through clinical trials.\nThere are provincial guidelines in existence that distinguish optimal treatment approaches for DLBCL patients based on the presence of comorbid disease, DLBCL subtypes, and in some provinces IPI risk groups. However, guidelines are not universally available in all provinces and thus provinces may differ in their recommendations based on institutional considerations. There is currently no Canadian-wide guideline that provides a roadmap to the standardized management of DLBCL in the relapsed/refractory setting. This indicates a need for an evidence-based guideline. In collaboration with Lymphoma Canada, a group of Canadian DLBCL experts have developed a nationwide consensus-guideline based on the current best available evidence for the management of patients with relapsed/refractory DLBCL.\n\n# GUIDELINE RECOMMENDATIONS\n- Proposed high-dose chemotherapy and ASCT eligibility criteria; 2. Recommendation for patients ineligible for ASCT; 3. Recommendation for patients who do not respond to salvage chemotherapy; 4. Proposed chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy eligibility criteria; 5. Recommendation for patients when CAR-T therapy is not feasible or for those who are ineligible for CAR-T therapy.\n\n# Methodology\nAn initial web-based search was performed on all provincial cancer centers to identify whether DLBCL management guidelines are in existence. DLBCL provincial experts were contacted to verify guidelines and provide insight and input if a guideline could not be located. Once existing guidelines were collected, information was extracted and differentiated based on common treatment considerations. Following compilation of provincial and institutional guidelines, this information was reviewed by the nationally developed panel of Canadian DLBCL experts for the development of recommendations, incorporating important considerations for patients in the relapse/refractory setting. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network categories of evidence and consensus (Table 1) was used by the steering committee to grade the level of evidence and support for the recommendations for relapsed/refractory DLBCL patients 3 . Consensus was achieved based on the level of evidence and support for each recommendation.\nA treatment algorithm was created based on these recommendations. \n\n# CATEGORY 1\nBased on the high-level evidence, there is uniform consensus that the intervention is appropriate.\n\n# CATEGORY 2A\nBased on the lower-level evidence, there is uniform consensus that the intervention is appropriate.\n\n# CATEGORY 2B\nBased on the lower-level evidence, there is consensus that the intervention is appropriate.\n\n# CATEGORY 3\nBased on any level of evidence, there is major disagreement that the intervention is appropriate.\nAn online search revealed existing DLBCL treatment and management guidelines in four provinces (British Columbia (BC), Alberta (AB), Ontario (ON), Nova Scotia (NS)). Three provinces (BC, AB, NS) had one guideline in existence, while one province (ON) had three DLBCL guidelines. Specialists from the remaining provinces (Saskatchewan (SK), Manitoba (MB), Quebec (QC), Newfoundland and Labrador (NF), New Brunswick (NB), Prince Edward Island (PEI)) and territories (Northwest Territories (NWT), Yukon (YK), Nunavut (NU)) were then contacted to confirm the existence of in-province/territory guidelines.\nPhysicians that did not have guidelines within their own province indicated they referred to BC Cancer (MB, PEI), Alberta Health Sciences (SK), Nova Scotia Cancer Care Program (PEI), Princess Margaret Cancer Centre (PMCC) and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines and adopted these guidelines to what is available locally and based on institutional regulations. Specific guidelines have not been uniformly adopted or endorsed, and feedback from specialists indicated an interest in the creation of a national DLBCL treatment guideline for both frontline and relapsed/refractory settings.\nThe information included in the existing provincial guidelines was reviewed for common themes to determine the methodology for data extraction and compilation to highlight similarities and differences. For relapsed/ refractory treatment, the common themes for treatment determination included transplant eligible vs. transplant ineligible and beyond second line treatment. The data from the existing guidelines was compiled according to these common themes as shown in Table 2.  \nGDP±R ➝ if CR/PR ➝ HDC + SCT GDP±R ➝ HDC- + in-vivo purge blood of tumour cells + ASCT *R-DICEP or R-MICE GDP±R ➝ if CR/PR ➝ HDC + SCT PET+ ➝ biopsy+ ➝ GDP±R ➝ if PR/CR ➝ HDC + SCT GDP±R ➝ if PR/CR➝ HDC- + ASCT - GDP, ICE, DHAP, ESHAP, EPOCH GDP±R ➝ if CR/PR ➝ HDC- + SCT - R-DHAP, R-ICE, R-mini-\n\n# Relapsed/Refractory DLBCL Treatment\nWith the frontline immunochemotherapy regimen R-CHOP, more than 50% of advanced-stage de novo DLBCL patients are expected to be cured 4,5 . However, there are factors that can prevent this outcome. Between 30-50% of patients with DLBCL will be refractory to R-CHOP or will relapse after achieving a complete remission due to adverse prognostic factors 4,6,7 . Most relapses will occur within the subsequent 2-3 years after initial treatment. Patients that relapse early (within 12 months), or patients with refractory disease, will have a worse prognosis even with second line therapy 8 .\nSalvage Therapy and High-Dose Chemotherapy Followed by ASCT Autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) is the standard treatment approach for DLBCL patients with chemosensitive disease that otherwise meet the eligibility criteria for this therapy. Certain criteria that could exclude patients from stem cell transplant include increasing age and comorbid health conditions. Older age (> 65 years) is not necessarily a contraindication to ASCT, and thus may be feasible in older more fit patients 9 . According to the stem cell transplant guidelines, ineligibility criteria for ASCT includes patients with poor performance status, active CNS involvement, and/or severe concomitant medical or psychiatric illness 10 .\nPatients with HIV seropositivity may be considered for ASCT if well-controlled. Additional ineligibility criteria to assess organ function typically includes bilirubin level > 2xULN, creatinine level > 150 µmol/L, creatinine clearance < 50ml/min, low cardiac ejection fraction (< 50%), and a forced expiratory volume in one second < 50% and/or carbon monoxide diffusion test < 50% of predicted level; these values may differ according to provincial standards 11 .\nPatients with primary refractory disease, which is typically defined as progression on therapy or within three months of treatment completion, are less likely to respond to salvage chemotherapy regimens and as a result will be less likely to benefit from ASCT. The landmark PARMA trial for establishing the role for ASCT over salvage chemotherapy alone showed an increase in event free survival (46% vs 12%) and 5-year overall survival (OS) (53% vs 32%) in the transplantation group over conventional therapy 12,13 .\nVarious studies have examined the use of different systemic treatment regimens prior to ASCT to maximize the response rate and OS. These regimens include R-DHAP (rituximab, dexamethasone, cytarabine, cisplatin) 14 , ICE (ifosfamide, carboplatin, etoposide) 15 , R-ICE (rituximab plus ICE) 16 , GDP (gemcitabine, dexamethasone, cisplatin) 17 and R-GEMOX (rituximab, gemcitabine, and oxaliplatin) 18,19 . Achieving better response to salvage chemotherapy is associated with better outcomes following ASCT, but no salvage regimen has been shown to be superior to another 20 .\nThe Canadian provincial guidelines and expert verification all report on stem cell transplant candidacy and salvage regimens in the relapsed/refractory setting for DLBCL patients. AB states the primary eligibility criteria for salvage chemotherapy followed by ASCT includes patients with good performance status.\nAge, used in the past as a measurement of performance, has been removed completely from the criteria across provinces, now placing an emphasis on fitness and tolerability of the patient. If residual mass is FDG-avid post-systemic therapy, a biopsy is recommended (ON-PMH; BC), whereby a positive biopsy meets the criteria to proceed with salvage chemotherapy and ASCT. Most guidelines that recommend a specific regimen for high-dose salvage chemotherapy recommend gemcitabine + dexamethasone + cisplatin (GDP), with or without rituximab. GDP is the preferred regimen as it can be given on an outpatient basis and is less toxic than alternatives, with preservation of a better quality of life 17,21 . To maximize response to ASCT, it is recommended to include rituximab as part of the salvage chemotherapy regimen to in-vivo purge the blood of tumour cells. Certain provinces may currently, or in the past have been, required to consider the availability to use rituximab in combination with salvage chemotherapy with the intent to proceed to ASCT, as funding may only be provided after a certain amount of time has passed from frontline treatment with rituximab-based chemoimmunotherapy. Other provinces provide funding for rituximab combinations with all salvage regimens as required. The provinces have listed alternative regimen options in their guidelines such as DP+R (docetaxel, cisplatin, rituximab), R-DICEP (dose-intensive cyclophosphamide, etoposide, cisplatin, rituximab) or R-MICE (mitoxantrone, etoposide, and cytarabine, rituximab), R-DHAP, R-ICE, R-mini-BEAM (rituximab, carmustine, etoposide, cytarabine, melphalan), ESHAP (etoposide, cytarabine, cisplatin, methylprednisolone) and EPOCH (etoposide, prednisone, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin).\nIn determining the response rate to ASCT, there are a few notable studies. The CORAL study, which examined the role for ASCT in the setting of early relapse following frontline treatment with R-CHOP, demonstrated similar response rates between the R-ICE and R-DHAP regimens 14 . Further, DLBCL patients with early rituximab failure were found to have a higher risk of disease relapse within the first year of transplantation 13 . With this information, this calls for a further need to understand the prognostic indicators that can identify r/r DLBCL patients that are unlikely to benefit from ASCT in order to investigate alternative therapies. One study reported that the presence of at least two of three risk factors (primary progressive disease, MYC rearrangement, intermediate-high NCCN-IPI) predicted a poor 2-year OS 22 .\n\n# RECOMMENDATIONS\nBased on high-level evidence, uniform consensus was achieved among the steering committee members on appropriate eligibility criteria for high-dose chemotherapy and ASCT: Based on high-level evidence, uniform consensus was achieved among the steering committee for the recommendation for stem cell transplant eligible chemosensitive patients to receive: salvage chemotherapy- followed by high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation.\n\n# Non-Stem Cell Candidates and Further Treatment Options\nThe prognosis of relapsed DLBCL patients who do not undergo high-dose therapy and ASCT is poor. Patients may either not meet the eligibility criteria to undergo ASCT, or not respond to salvage chemotherapy. Among patients who progress following frontline treatment, only 30-40% will respond to salvage chemotherapy and proceed with ASCT 5,14,17,23 . Even for those patients that respond to salvage chemotherapy and undergo ASCT, 50% are likely to relapse following transplantation 5,24,25 . The SCHOLAR-1 study among other similar studies, demonstrated that DLBCL patient's that are refractory to second-line therapy or relapse within < 12 months post-ASCT have poor outcomes 5,23,26,27,28 . In Canada, the standard approach for r/r DLBCL patients not responding to salvage chemotherapy or not eligible for ASCT is CAR T-cell therapy 20. Some provinces have funding and FACT (Foundation for the Accreditation of Cellular Therapy) accredited centers, and thus are able to administer manufactured CAR-T treatment locally. Other provinces will fund CAR-T therapy but will send their patients to receive treatment in other provinces or even to the United States. There are some provinces that also have new in-house CAR-T products available to patients through clinical trials. A list of current CAR T-cell therapies available to patients in Canada can be found in Supplementary Table 1.\nDepending on the patient's health and fitness, treatment options for those that are ineligible for stem cell transplant, do not respond to salvage chemotherapy or relapse post-ASCT, include CAR T-cell therapy if appropriate, clinical trials, or palliative chemotherapy 10 or radiotherapy 29 . There are numerous chemotherapy options, but response rates are generally low and remission duration is short, however studies on the combination of these therapies are underway 30 . Polatuzumab vedotin, bendamustine and rituximab (Pola-BR) demonstrated improved PFS (7.5 vs 2.0 months), OS (12.4 vs 4.7 months), and time to first response and CR compared with bendamustine and rituximab 31,32,33 . This treatment provides a promising option for Canadians in this setting, as it is currently HC approved and recently obtained a positive CADTH recommendation for reimbursement. With high CR rates and prolonged disease control, Pola-BR is a beneficial stand-alone treatment and may even provide an important bridge in the future to consolidative therapies including SCT or CAR-T.\nAnother promising agent evaluated in combination with polatuzumab vedotin was obinituzumab, with a PFS and OS of 6.3 and 10.8 months respectively at median follow-up 34 . However, in comparison with Pola-BR, there was no indication of benefit of obinituzumab over rituximab in this setting 33 . Another therapy combination includes lenalidomide and tafasitamab, which demonstrated a modest ORR, with 43% having a CR, and is currently FDA approved and awaiting review by HC 35,36 . Neither of these regimens thus far are provincially funded, nor are their backbone therapies BR and lenalidomide, respectively. Other combination regimens are still in testing including ibrutinib, lenalidomide and rituximab, showing an ORR of 44% 37 . Chemotherapy options for fit patients can include R-ICE, RGemOx (rituximab, oxaliplatin, cytosine arabinoside, dexamethasone) 38 , and R-DHAX/rituximab, oxaliplatin, cytosine arabinoside, dexamethasone (ROAD) 39,40,41 . Palliative strategies can also be employed and should be simple to use, not require intravenous administration, and allow for outpatient administration 42 . Options tested but not all currently available in Canada include oral agents (prednisone, etoposide, procarbazine, cyclophosphamide) used alone or in combination (i.e. PEP-C) 42 , or intravenous therapy including GEPD (gemcitabine, etoposide, cisplatin, dexamethasone), DHAP, ESHAP, and EPIC (etoposide, prednisolone, ifosfamide, cisplatin) 43 .\nRarely, patients can have late relapses and may be eligible to receive curative intent therapy in the absence of transplant. Localized disease should be treated with combined modality therapy, while for advanced stage disease, combination chemotherapy may be appropriate especially with a low secondary IPI; this may be a curative approach in a minority of patients 12 . However, for the majority of transplant ineligible patients, as well as for those who have relapsed following transplant, the first consideration is eligibility for CAR-T treatment. For those that are ineligible for CAR-T, options are broad but may include further palliative chemotherapy or radiotherapy, or clinical trials. Clinical trials are the favoured approach if patients meet the eligibility criteria and are interested in participating. Although rare, patients with good performance status may be suitable for further combination chemotherapy including R-GDP, and less commonly R-ICE. For less fit patients, single agent chemotherapy may be used. Of note, these regimens can also be used as bridging therapy for CAR T-cell therapy. Other options for symptomatic management for this patient group at the time of palliation, or beyond second relapse, can include low dose daily oral chemotherapy with chlorambucil (0.1mg/kg/day) or etoposide (50 mg/day), prednisone, palliative regimen (cyclophosphamide/Celebrex or VP16/prednisone) or combination oral therapy (i.e. PEP-C), as detailed and endorsed by specific Canadian guidelines. This shows a high unmet need for reliable and effective treatment options for patients that are ASCT ineligible or progress following ASCT, where CAR-T may not be an option.\nFour of the six Canadian guidelines available (AB, ON, NS, BC), more recent in their versions, present the option of CAR-T therapy for patient's ineligible for ASCT, have refractory disease post-frontline treatment and following two lines of therapy, or relapse following ASCT. However, CAR-T is employed across the country, even though provincial guidelines in existence may not have been recently updated with this information. For example, though CAR-T is available as a treatment option locally in Quebec, no provincially published treatment guideline is available stating this. CAR-T treatment provides a potentially curative approach in this patient population where cure was largely not possible. Results from the ZUMA-1 and JULIET trials were pivotal for understanding the role of CAR-T therapy in the setting of contraindications for ASCT or relapse following ASCT. With CAR-T, about 40% of patients achieved a CR and 12% achieved a PR 44 .\nThough higher among the CR patients, at 12 months the rate of RFS was 65% 44 . Currently, CAR-T is approved in Canada for DLBCL patients that are disease refractory or have relapsed following two or more lines of therapy. If this option is not appropriate due to ineligibility criteria which can include decreased performance status, organ dysfunction (renal, cardiac, pulmonary) and active CNS disease, patients will typically be considered for clinical trials or palliative treatment options 45 . It is recommended that CAR-T is preferred over allo-SCT, and allo-SCT may be an option in some provinces if the patient relapses after CAR-T.\nBridging therapies are used if there is a concern for or evidence of progressive disease, causing symptoms or worsened clinical status. Therapies include single-agent treatment with cyclophosphamide, cytarabine, gemcitabine, GDP±R, DHAP±R, ICE±R, localized radiation therapy for bulky or symptomatic disease, steroids (dexamethasone or methylprednisolone), or GemOx±R 20 . *New options may become available in the palliation or clinical trial setting, such as Pola-BR.\n\n# Relapse following/Refractory to Frontline Therapy\n\n# Conclusion\nDespite the progress in frontline therapy response rates for DLBCL patients, patients still experience disease relapses or are refractory to frontline treatment. The standard recommended therapy for this patient population is salvage therapy followed by high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation. Though this treatment option does have a positive outcome in a large percentage of r/r DLBCL patients, there is still a group of patients that are ineligible for ASCT, are not responsive to salvage chemotherapy, or relapse post-ASCT. This patient group has a poor prognosis and is in need for effective treatment approaches. With CAR T-cell therapy being approved in Canada, this provides patients an encouraging prognosis.\nThe recommendation for patients in this group is to receive CAR-T, with bridging therapy if required. For patients that are not eligible for CAR-T or relapse post-CAR T-cell therapy, the recommendation includes palliative therapies and clinical trials. New options may become available in this setting once funded, such as Pola-BR. These are the recommendations issued by the national steering committee of leading hematologists and oncologists across Canada for patients with relapsed/refractory DLBCL.", "source": "cma", "question": "According to the Canadian national consensus guideline for relapsed/refractory DLBCL, outline a stepwise management plan for an adult patient who is ineligible for high‑dose chemotherapy and ASCT, including how you would: (a) assess and determine eligibility for CAR‑T therapy; (b) select and justify appropriate bridging therapies when needed; (c) choose subsequent treatment options if CAR‑T is not feasible or if the patient relapses after CAR‑T (including clinical trials, palliative systemic or radiotherapy, and use of agents such as Pola‑BR or tafasitamab/lenalidomide where applicable); and (d) incorporate provincial access and funding constraints into your treatment decisions."}

{"guideline_text": "Ehlers–Danlos syndrome\n\n# Overview\nEhlers–Danlos syndrome (EDS)  is an inherited connective tissue disorder with different presentations that have been classified into several primary types. EDS is caused by a defect in the structure, production, or processing of collagen or proteins that interact with collagen, such as mutations in the COL5A or COL3A genes. (This is the collagen of granulation tissue, and is produced quickly by young fibroblasts before the tougher type I collagen is synthesized. Reticular fiber. Also found in artery walls, skin, intestines and the uterus.--COL3A1).\nThe collagen in connective tissue helps tissues resist deformation. Collagen is an important contributor to the physical strength of skin, joints, muscles, ligaments, blood vessels and visceral organs; abnormal collagen renders these structures more elastic. The severity of the mutation can be life-threatening, but many EDS patients die from other complications caused by the illness. There is no cure, and treatment is supportive, including close monitoring of the digestive, excretory and particularly the cardiovascular systems. Occupational and physical therapy, bracing, and corrective surgery may help with the frequent injuries and pain that tend to develop in certain types of EDS, although extra caution and special practices are advised to prevent permanent damage.\nThe features of EDS were first described by Hippocrates in 400 BC. The syndrome is named after two physicians, Edvard Ehlers from Denmark, and Henri-Alexandre Danlos from France, who described it at the turn of the 20th century.\n\n# Classification\nIn the past, there were 10 recognized types of Ehlers–Danlos syndrome. In 1997, researchers proposed a simpler classification that reduced the number of major types to six and gave them descriptive names. These six major types are listed here. Other types of the condition may exist, but they have been reported only in single families or are not well characterized. Except for hypermobility, some of the specific mutations involved have been identified and they can be precisely identified by genetic testing; this is valuable due to a great deal of variation in individual cases. However, negative genetic test results do not rule out the diagnosis, since not all of the mutations have been discovered; therefore the clinical presentation is very important. Although the following classifications are well defined, it is rare for a case to fit neatly in a single category, and cross-over symptoms lead to under-diagnosis or mis-diagnosis. Therefore, patients should not rely on the \"fact\" of having a certain type of EDS if cross-over symptoms are evident because of possibly life-threatening symptoms. For example, it is possible for an individual with Classical EDS to exhibit symptoms of Hypermobility or Vascular EDS.\nIn order of prevalence in the population, the classifications are:\nOverall, research statistics of EDS show the prevalence as 1 in 2,500 to 1 in 5,000 people. Recent clinical experience suggests that this condition goes under-diagnosed and the condition is more common than these ratios indicate.\n\n## Other types\nForms of EDS within this category may present with soft, mildly stretchable skin, shortened bones, chronic diarrhea, joint hypermobility and dislocation, bladder rupture, or poor wound healing. Inheritance patterns within this group include X-linked recessive, autosomal dominant, and autosomal recessive. Examples of types of related syndromes other than those above reported in the medical literature include:\n- 305200 – Type 5\n- 130080 – Type 8 – unspecified gene, locus 12p13\n- 225310 – Type 10 – unspecified gene, locus 2q34\n- 608763 – Beasley–Cohen type\n- 130070 – Progeroid form – B4GALT7\n- 606408 – Due to Tenascin-X deficiency – TNXB\n- 130090 – Type unspecified\n- 601776 – D4ST1-Deficient Ehlers–Danlos syndrome (Adducted Thumb-Clubfoot Syndrome) CHST14\n\n# Signs and symptoms\nSigns vary widely based on which type of EDS the patient has. In each case, however, the signs are ultimately due to faulty or reduced amounts of collagen. EDS typically affects the joints, skin, and blood vessels. Following is a list of major signs and symptoms.\nMusculoskeletal:\n- Hyper-flexible joints (It is possible to be very flexible or have \"double joints\", however, this is not the same as EDS.)\n- Unstable joints that are prone to: sprain, dislocation, subluxation and hyperextension\n- Early onset of advanced osteoarthritis\n- Chronic degenerative joint disease\n- Swan neck deformity of the fingers\n- Boutonniere deformity of the fingers\n- Tearing of tendons or muscles\n- Deformities of the spine, such as: scoliosis (curvature of the spine), kyphosis (a thoracic hump), tethered spinal cord syndrome, occipitoatlantoaxial hypermobility\n- Myalgia (muscle pain) and arthralgia (joint pain), which may be severe\n- Trendelenburg's sign\n- Osgood-Schlatter Disease\nSkin:\n- Fragile skin that tears easily\n- Easy bruising\n- Redundant skin folds\n- Molluscoid pseudotumors, especially on pressure points\n- Subcutaneous spheroids\n- Livedo reticularis\nCardiovascular:\n- Arterial rupture\n- Valvular heart disease (such as mitral valve prolapse, which creates an increased risk for infective endocarditis during surgery, as well as possibly progressing to a life-threatening degree of severity of the prognosis of mitral valve prolapse)\n- Dilation and/or rupture of ascending aorta\n- Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome\n- Raynaud's Phenomenon\nOther manifestations or complications:\n- Hiatial hernia\n- Anal prolapse\n- Collapsed lung (pneumothorax)\n- Nerve compression disorders (carpal tunnel syndrome, acroparesthesia, neuropathy)\n- Insensitivity to local anesthetics.\n- Arnold–Chiari malformation (brain disorder)\n- Platelet aggregation failure (platelets do not clump together properly)\n- Pregnancy complications: increased pain, mild to moderate peripartum bleeding, cervical insufficiency, uterine tearing, or  premature rupture of membranes.\n- Sleep Apnea\nBecause it is often undiagnosed or misdiagnosed in childhood, some instances of Ehlers–Danlos syndrome have been mischaracterized as child abuse. The pain associated with this condition is a serious complication.\n\n# Genetics\nAs mentioned under \"Classification\" above, only some variations of Ehlers-Danlos can be positively identified as tied to specific genetic variation (as opposed to epigenetic or environmental factors.)\nMutations in the following genes can cause different subtypes of the Ehlers–Danlos syndrome:\n- Fibrous proteins: COL1A1, COL1A2, COL3A1, COL5A1, COL5A2, and TNXB\n- Enzymes: ADAMTS2, PLOD1, B4GALT7, DSE, and D4ST1/CHST14\nMutations in these genes usually alter the structure, production, or processing of collagen or proteins that interact with collagen. Collagen provides structure and strength to connective tissue throughout the body. A defect in collagen can weaken connective tissue in the skin, bones, blood vessels, and organs, resulting in the features of the disorder.\nInheritance patterns depend on the type of Ehlers–Danlos Syndrome. Most forms of the condition are inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means only one of the two copies of the gene in question must be altered to cause the disorder. The minority are inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene must be altered for a person to be affected by the condition. It can also be an individual (de novo or \"sporadic\") mutation. Please refer to the summary for each type of Ehlers–Danlos syndrome for a discussion of its inheritance pattern.\n\n# Diagnosis\nA diagnosis can be made by an evaluation of medical history and clinical observation. The Brighton criteria are widely used to assess the degree of joint hypermobility. Both DNA and biochemical studies can be used to help identify affected individuals. Diagnostic tests include: collagen gene mutation testing, collagen typing via skin biopsy, echocardiogram, and lysyl hydroxylase or oxidase activity. However, these tests are not able to confirm all cases, especially in instances of an unmapped mutation, and so clinical evaluation by a geneticist remains essential. If there are multiple affected individuals in a family, it may be possible to perform prenatal diagnosis using a DNA information technique known as a linkage study.\n\n## Physical Eamination\n\n### Skin\n- Ehlers danlos syndrome.

Adapted from Dermatology Atlas.\n\n## Differential diagnosis\nThere are several disorders that share some characteristics with Ehlers–Danlos Syndrome. For example, in cutis laxa the skin is loose, hanging, and wrinkled. In EDS, the skin can be pulled away from the body but is elastic and returns to normal when let go. In Marfan syndrome, the joints are very mobile and similar cardiovascular complications occur. People with EDS tend to have a \"Marfanoid\" appearance (e.g. tall, skinny, long arms and legs, \"spidery\" fingers). However, it is important to note that physical appearance and features in several types of Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome also have characteristics including short stature, large eyes, and the appearance of a small mouth and/or chin, due to a small palate. The palate can also have a high arch, causing dental crowding. Blood vessels can sometimes be easily seen through translucent skin, especially on the chest. In the past, Menkes disease, a copper metabolism disorder, was thought to be a form of Ehlers–Danlos syndrome. It is not uncommon for patients to be misdiagnosed with Fibromyalgia, bleeding disorders or a variety of other disorders that can mimic EDS symptoms before a correct diagnosis is made. Because of these similar disorders, and complications that can arise from an unmonitored case of EDS, a correct diagnosis is very important.\nPseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE) is worth consideration in diagnosing a patient.\n\n# Management\nThere is no cure for Ehlers Danlos Syndrome. Treatment is palliative. Close monitoring of the cardiovascular system, physiotherapy, occupational therapy,  and orthopedic instruments (e.g., wheelchairs, bracing, casting) may be helpful. Orthopedic instruments are helpful for the prevention of further joint damage, especially for long distances, although it is advised that individuals not become dependent on them until there are no other options for mobility. One should avoid activities that cause the joint to lock or overextend.\nA physician may prescribe casting to stabilize joints. Physicians may refer a patient to an orthotist for orthotic treatment (bracing). Physicians may also consult a physical and/or occupational therapist to help strengthen muscles and to teach people how to properly use and preserve their joints.\nThere are different types of physiotherapy. Aquatic therapy promotes muscular development and coordination. With manual therapy, the joint will be gently mobilized within the range of motion and/or manipulations. Electrotherapy like transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation reduces local musculoskeletal pain.\nIf conservative therapy is not helpful, surgical repair of joints may be necessary at some time. Medication to decrease pain or manage cardiac, digestive, or other related conditions may be prescribed. To decrease bruising and improve wound healing, some patients have responded to ascorbic acid (vitamin C). Special precautions are often taken by medical care workers because of the sheer amount of complications that tend to arise in EDS patients. In Vascular EDS, signs of chest or abdominal pain are to be considered trauma situations.\nIn general, medical intervention is limited to symptomatic therapy. Prior to pregnancy, patients with EDS should have genetic counseling. Children with EDS should be provided with information about the disorder, so they can understand why contact sports and certain other physically stressful activities should be avoided. Children should be taught early on that demonstrating the unusual positions they can maintain due to loose joints should not be done as this may cause early degeneration of the joints. Patients may find it hard to cope with the drawbacks of the disease. In this case emotional support and behavioral and psychological therapy can be useful. Support groups are found to be immensely helpful for patients dealing with major lifestyle changes and poor health. Family members, teachers and friends should be provided with information about EDS so they can accept and assist the child as necessary.\nDespite all these different types of conservative therapy, except bracing, results show that conservative therapy is ineffective in contrast to midcarpal instability in normal patients. L. Rombaut showed that in almost 40% of the cases, conservative therapy has a neutral or even a negative outcome.\nThereby has to be noted that conservative therapy may be unsuccessful in controlling instability in the longer term.\n\n## Surgery\nThe instability of joints, leading to (sub)luxations and joint pain, often require surgical intervention in patients with Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome. Instability of almost all joints can happen, but appear most often in the lower and upper extremities, with the wrist, fingers, shoulder, knee, hip, and ankle being most common.\nCommon surgical procedures are joint debridement, tendon replacements, capsulorraphy and arthroplasty. Studies have shown that after surgery, degree of stabilization, pain reduction, and patient satisfaction can improve, but surgery does not guarantee an optimal result and both patients and surgeons report being dissatisfied with the results. Consensus is that conservative treatment is more effective than surgery, particularly since patients with Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome have extra risks of surgical complications due to the disease. Three basic surgical problems arise due to EDS: the strength of the tissues is decreased, which makes the tissue less suitable for surgery; the fragilty of the bloodvessels can cause problems during surgery; and wound healing is often delayed or incomplete.\nStudies have shown that local anesthetics, arterial catheters and central venous catheters cause a higher risk in haematoma formation in patients with Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome. Ehlers-Danlos patients also show a resistance to local anaesthetics.\nSpecial recommendations for anesthesia in EDS patients are prepared by orphan anesthesia.eu and deal with all aspects of anesthesia for EDS patients. Detailed recommendations for anesthesia and perioperative care of patients with EDS should be used to improve individual patient safety aspects.\nSurgery with Ehlers-Danlos patients requires careful tissue handling and a longer immobilization afterwards.\n\n# Prognosis\nThe outlook for individuals with EDS depends on the type of EDS with which they have been diagnosed. Symptoms vary in severity, even within one sub-type, and the frequency of complications changes on an individual basis. Some individuals have negligible symptoms while others are severely restricted in their daily life. Extreme joint instability, chronic musculoskeletal pain, degenerative joint disease, frequent injuries, and spinal deformities may limit a person's mobility. Severe spinal deformities may affect breathing. In the case of extreme joint instability, dislocations may result from simple tasks such as rolling over in bed or turning a doorknob. Secondary conditions such as autonomic dysfunction or cardiovascular problems, occurring in any type, can affect prognosis and quality of life. Severe mobility-related disability is seen more often in Hypermobility-type than in Classical-type or Vascular-type.\nAlthough all types are potentially life-threatening, the majority of individuals will have a normal lifespan. However, those with blood vessel fragility have a high risk of fatal complications. Arterial rupture is the most common cause of sudden death in EDS. Spontaneous arterial rupture most often occurs in the second or third decade, but can occur at any time. The median life-expectancy within the population with Vascular EDS is 48 years.\nEDS is a lifelong condition. Affected individuals may face social obstacles related to their disease on a daily basis. Some people with EDS have reported living with fears of significant and painful ruptures, their condition worsening, becoming unemployed due to physical and emotional burdens, and social stigmatization in general.\n\n# Epidemiology\nEhlers–Danlos syndrome is an inherited disorder estimated to occur in about 1 in 5000 births worldwide. Initially, prevalence estimates ranged from 1 in 250,000 to 1 in 500,000 people, but these estimates were soon found to be vastly inaccurate as the disorder received further study and medical professionals became more adept at accurately diagnosing EDS. In fact, many experts now believe that Ehlers–Danlos syndrome may be far more common than the currently accepted estimate due to the wide range of severities in which the disorder presents. However, the prevalence of the six types differs dramatically. The most commonly occurring type is the hypermobility type, followed by the classical type. The other types of Ehlers–Danlos syndrome are very rare. For example, fewer than 10 infants and children with the dermatosparaxis type have been described worldwide. Ehlers–Danlos affects both males and females of all racial and ethnic backgrounds, although some types are more common among certain groups than others.\n\n# Society and culture\n- In the 19th century, there were several sideshow performers billed variously as The Elastic Skin Man, The India Rubber Man and Frog Boy. They included such well known individuals (in their time) as Felix Wehrle, James Morris and Avery Childs.\n- Several current celebrities have EDS:\nActress Cherylee Houston has type 3 EDS and uses a wheelchair; she made history by becoming Coronation Street's first full-time disabled actress.\nThe condition may have contributed to the virtuoso violinist Niccolò Paganini's skill as he was able to play wider fingerings than the normal violinist.\nEric the Midget, a member of Howard Stern's Wack Pack has Ehlers–Danlos Syndrome Type VII.\nAdult film star Mandy Morbid has discussed the impact EDS has on her mobility and her life.\nRei Haycraft, lead singer for the hard rock band, Raimee, artist, and illustrator.

It is seen as a sporadic condition in domestic dogs.  Degenerative suspensory ligament desmitis (DSLD) is a similar condition seen in many breeds of horses.  Though it was originally notated in the Peruvian Paso and thought to be a condition of overwork and older age, the disease is being recognized in all age groups and all activity levels. It has even been noted in newborn foals.

{"guideline_text": "Revised STandards for Reporting Interventions in Clinical Trials of Acupuncture (STRICTA): Extending the CONSORT Statement\n\nIntroductionThe STRICTA (Standards for Reporting Interventions in Clinical Trials of Acupuncture) reporting guidelines, first published in 2001[1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9], were designed to improve the completeness and transparency of reporting of interventions in controlled trials of acupuncture, in order that such trials may be more accurately interpreted and readily replicated. STRICTA comprised a checklist that expanded the generic content of Item 4 of the CONSORT statement[10,11], which relates to the reporting of the intervention.A survey of authors of clinical trials and systematic reviews was subsequently conducted to determine the usefulness of STRICTA in helping them write their reports[12]. In addition, a survey of 90 acupuncture trials was undertaken to assess whether use of the STRICTA checklist was associated with improved reporting over time[13]. The results of these initiatives led to conclusions that most STRICTA items were found to be necessary and easy to use, though some were seen as poorly reported, ambiguous or possibly redundant, and a number of suggestions were made for additional items. A revision of STRICTA was therefore proposed.Meanwhile, extensions to CONSORT have been developed to cover the reporting of non-pharmacological treatments[14,15]and pragmatic trials[16]. Since there are acupuncture specific aspects to reporting not covered by these extensions, it was decided that STRICTA should be revised in a manner congruent with CONSORT and its extensions for non-pharmacological treatments and pragmatic trials.The combination of these developments led to an agreement between the CONSORT Group and the STRICTA Group, in collaboration with the Chinese Cochrane Centre and the Chinese Centre for Evidence-based Medicine, to revise STRICTA as a formal extension to CONSORT. The revision processes have been described in more detail elsewhere[17]. This paper describes the outcome in terms of a new checklist, updated explanations, and published examples of good reporting.MethodsIn the summer of 2008, a group of 47 experts from the original STRICTA Group, the CONSORT Group, the World Federation of Acupuncture and Moxibustion Societies, the Acupuncture Trialists' Collaboration [18], the Society for Acupuncture Research [19], and clinical trial authors were surveyed[12]. The experts were from 15 countries, 41 had academic positions, 31 were acupuncturists, 18 were involved with journals, such as board members, 15 were physicians, and 11 had been involved previously in developing reporting guidelines. These experts were consulted in regard to a draft of revised STRICTA items that had evolved from previous research[12,13]. Feedback was collated and forwarded (with permission) to those invited to a consensus development workshop, the next phase of the revision process.Twenty-one individuals attended a workshop in Freiburg, Germany, in October 2008. The attendees included experts in epidemiology, trial methodology, statistics, and medical journal editing. Just over half the participants were acupuncturists from a variety of backgrounds, including physician and non-physician. All attendees received collated feedback from the 47 experts, along with a draft revised STRICTA checklist for consideration.The workshop comprised presentations about the history of STRICTA, CONSORT, and the then new CONSORT nonpharmacological treatments extension[14,15].

A general discussion and agreement on generic issues relating to STRICTA were followed by a discussion of each nominated checklist item. The aim was to agree, where possible, on the content of the updated draft checklist as well as to develop a revised set of explanations for each included item.\nSubsequent to the workshop, a small writing group edited drafts of the revised STRICTA checklist, identifying for each item one or more exemplars of good reporting, and developed text explaining the rationale and discussing relevant evidence. Taking into account further feedback from those attending the Freiburg workshop, the writing group finalised the STRICTA checklist, the explanations and the examples of good reporting.\n\n# Results\nNote: In the Examples that follow, the embedded terms (ref) and refer to sources that are reported in the original published studies, but the details of these sources are not provided in this article for reasons of brevity.\nThere was agreement that STRICTA should continue to function as a stand-alone guideline for reporting acupuncture studies, and be an official extension of CONSORT for reporting randomized controlled trials. There was also consensus on a minor change of name, in that the word ''controlled'' in STRICTA should be replaced by ''clinical'', to indicate that it was applicable for reporting a broad range of clinical evaluation designs, including uncontrolled outcome studies and case reports. The group agreed that the rationale behind reporting should be to provide the information needed to allow replication of a study, reduce ambiguity and enhance transparency. The group recognised that acupuncture trials inevitably differ in the degree of individualisation of care that is permitted, and agreed that the reporting guideline should acknowledge this and be applicable across the whole range of designs.

Below we provide the checklist text for each of the six items and their sub-items, as well as explanations on the need for their adequate reporting and examples of good reporting from the published literature.\n\n## Stricta item 1: acupuncture rationale\n\n## Item 1a\nStyle of acupuncture (e.g. Traditional Chinese Medicine, Japanese, Korean, Western medical, Five Element, ear acupuncture, etc.).\nExplanation. Acupuncture has a long history in many cultures and is characterised by a broad diversity of styles and approaches in both East Asia and the West. In order for the readers to contextualize the trial within the range of current clinical practices, researchers should state the overall style or approach on which they have based the treatments. If the researcher believes the treatment approach is completely novel, then this should be clearly stated.\nExamples.

The author(s) should provide the reasoning for the chosen treatment, including rationale for diagnosis, point selection and treatment procedures. The ''rules'' that were used in providing treatments should be described. When treatments were selected that have roots in traditional practice, it is recommended that the historical and cultural context be supplied. This is relevant for interventions within styles such as ''Traditional Chinese Medicine'' or ''TCM'', where the broad diversity of approaches requires careful identification of where and when the treatment parameters were developed. Where consensus methods, expert\n\n## Summary points\n\n## N the standards for reporting interventions in clinical\nTrials of Acupuncture (STRICTA) were published in five journals in 2001 and 2002. These guidelines, in the form of a checklist and explanations for use by authors and journal editors, were designed to improve reporting of acupuncture trials, particularly the interventions, thereby facilitating their interpretation and replication. Subsequent reviews of the application and impact of STRICTA have highlighted the value of STRICTA as well as scope for improvements and revision.\nN To manage the revision process a collaboration between the STRICTA Group, the CONSORT Group, and the Chinese Cochrane Centre was developed in 2008. An expert panel with 47 participants was convened that provided electronic feedback on a revised draft of the checklist. At a subsequent face-to-face meeting in Freiburg, a group of 21 participants further revised the STRICTA checklist and planned dissemination.\nN The new STRICTA checklist, which is an official extension of CONSORT, includes six items and 17 sub-items. These set out reporting guidelines for the acupuncture rationale, the details of needling, the treatment regimen, other components of treatment, the practitioner background, and the control or comparator interventions. In addition, and as part of this revision process, the explanations for each item have been elaborated, and examples of good reporting for each item are provided. In addition, the word ''controlled'' in STRICTA is replaced by ''clinical'', to indicate that STRICTA is applicable to a broad range of clinical evaluation designs, including uncontrolled outcome studies and case reports.\nN It is intended that the revised STRICTA, in conjunction with both the main CONSORT Statement and extension for nonpharmacologic treatment, will raise the quality of reporting of clinical trials of acupuncture.\nclinical panels, practitioner surveys or some combination of sources have been used to define the treatment protocol, it is recommended that full details of the methodology be given. Literature and other sources should be provided where relevant, in order that others can replicate the trial by consulting these source(s) and/or developmental methods on which treatment was based. Authors are encouraged to reference published works that are easily obtainable, such as a book or journal article. If the reference is a thesis, non-published work, written material only available in a different language from the journal article, or a verbal communication, authors are encouraged to present or summarise the information in an appendix or make it otherwise generally available (e.g. on a website). For fully individualised trials where the goal is to have representative practitioners who are encouraged to practice as they normally do, it is appropriate to specify the selection process for the practitioners, providing details of criteria for their inclusion. It is important to note that where details of the intended intervention are defined in advance, it is possible that what was actually administered may have differed. In such cases, precise details of the treatments that were provided are also necessary.\nExamples. (i) This study employed a style of Japanese acupuncture developed by Shima and Chace (ref) and Manaka (ref), and follows the Japanese acupuncture training curriculum at the New England School of Acupuncture. In comparison to typical traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) acupuncture, Japanese acupuncture uses smaller needles and inserts needles less deeply and with less manipulation.(ref) For these reasons, we believed Japanese acupuncture would be less invasive than TCM, and thus better received by our adolescent population. Japanese acupuncture has been shown to be effective in treating certain pain conditions.(ref) The specific acupuncture protocols employed in this study are briefly described below and discussed in greater detail in a companion paper(ref) [bib_ref] Japanese-Style Acupuncture for Endometriosis-Related Pelvic Pain in Adolescents and Young Women: Results..., Wayne [/bib_ref].\n(ii) We based point selection on individualized Western acupuncture techniques by using a list of points previously reported as being effective in neck pain (refs) and by reaching a consensus according to our own clinical and teaching practice.(ref)\nThe specific points for each individual were defined at each treatment session, depending on the patient's pain distribution and palpation of the neck and thorax to determine ah-shi points, or local tender points, for acupuncture. At least one distal point was used. Point location and depth of insertion were as described in traditional texts(ref) [bib_ref] Acupuncture versus placebo for the treatment of chronic mechanical neck pain: a..., White [/bib_ref].\n(iii) We developed the treatment strategies for acupuncture and minimal acupuncture in a consensus process with three acupuncture specialists (names provided) representing two major German societies for medical acupuncture: the German Medical Acupuncture Association (Deutsche Ä rztegesellschaft für Akupunktur, DÄ GfA) and the International Society for Chinese Medicine (Societas Medicinae Sinensis, SMS). The first step involved three specialists (names provided) and the study team developing a proposal, which was followed by a discussion including more than 30 acupuncture experts from both acupuncture societies. The final intervention strategies were defined by the above mentioned three specialists together with the study team and subsequently were communicated to the external advisors [bib_ref] Interventions and Physician Characteristics in a Randomized Multicenter Trial of Acupuncture in..., Brinkhaus [/bib_ref].\n\n## Item 1c\nExtent to which treatment was varied.\n\n## 4.b\nSettings and locations where the data were collected\n\n## Interventions 5\nThe interventions for each group with sufficient details to allow replication, including how and when they were actually administered Precise details of both the experimental treatment and comparator -see [fig_ref] Table 1: STRICTA 2010 checklist of information to include when reporting interventions in a...

The extent to which the treatment was individualised, both between patients and between practitioners, should be described. Trial protocols choose one of three broad levels of individualisation, ranging from none at all (all patients receiving the same treatment at all sessions), through partially individualised treatments (e.g. use of a fixed set of points to be combined with a set of points to be used flexibly), to fully individualised treatment protocols within which each patient receives a unique and evolving diagnosis and treatment. Additionally, the practitioners may have to apply a standardised theoretical framework, or may be allowed to apply their own. Many styles of acupuncture, whether based on traditional theories or Westernized concepts such as trigger points, are individualised in routine practice. Trials that are more pragmatic [bib_ref] Pragmatic clinical trials, Macpherson [/bib_ref] in their aim, and designed to replicate routine settings and patient groups, have more of an emphasis on fully individualised treatment. In such cases standardisation may consist of a protocol that instructs practitioners to provide treatments as they normally do. Trials that are more explanatory (mechanistic) in their aim tend to need a tighter definition of specific components in order to minimise variation across treatments.\nExamples. (i) Each patient received individualized acupuncture treatments that focused on specific needs and symptoms that the individual was experiencing. The rationale for this intervention was to test acupuncture as it is typically performed in practice. Point selection was based on the general principles of acupuncture and Traditional Chinese Medicine.(ref)\nThe treatment was modified over the course of the study to accommodate the individual's changing pattern of pain, sleep, or other health issues [bib_ref] Effect of acupuncture administered in a group setting on pain and subjective..., Phillips [/bib_ref].\n(ii) The verum points consisted of obligatory points and additional points individually chosen by the physicians on the basis of traditional Chinese medicine diagnosis for syndromes (including tongue diagnosis), acupuncture channels related to the individual headache area, and Ah Shi points (locus dolendi points) [bib_ref] Efficacy of acupuncture for the prophylaxis of migraine: a multicentre randomised controlled..., Diener [/bib_ref].\n\n## Section/topic\nItem # CONSORT 2010 Statement*: Checklist item.

Moreover, additional extensions are forthcoming. For those and also for up-to-date references relevant to this checklist, see http://www. Explanation. It is recommended that the reporting of this item should include a total of needle insertions per subject per session. This item is relevant to all designs of randomised controlled trials, from pragmatic to explanatory. For more explanatory designs where a formula of points is prescribed, the number of needle insertions should be reported as a simple total. For more pragmatic designs, with individualised treatments, the mean and range should be reported. Clearly, full details of individualised treatment cannot be reported in every section of Item 2 below. However, each item should be considered and as much information given as possible.\n\n## Implementation of intervention\nExamples. (i) The protocol allowed for up to 10 treatments per patient, the precise number being agreed between patient and practitioner. A total of 1269 treatments were provided, an average of 8.6 treatments per patient (range 1-10) and 9.6 needles per treatment (range [bib_ref] Standards for Reporting Interventions in Controlled Trials of Acupuncture: The STRICTA Recommendations, Lee [/bib_ref] [bib_ref] Standards for Reporting Interventions in Controlled Trials of Acupuncture: The STRICTA Recommendations, Liujianping [/bib_ref] [bib_ref] Improving the Quality of Reports in Controlled Trials of Acupuncture by Using..., Liuxuemei [/bib_ref] [bib_ref] CONSORT 2010 Explanation and Elaboration: updated guidelines for reporting parallel group randomised..., Moher [/bib_ref] [bib_ref] Assessing the utility of the standards for reporting trials of acupuncture (STRICTA):..., Prady [/bib_ref]. See for variations between practitioners [bib_ref] Acupuncture for low back pain: traditional diagnosis and treatment of 148 patients..., Macpherson [/bib_ref].\n(ii) Disposable stainless steel needles (0.2650mm, Seirin) were inserted into the skin over the trigger point to a depth of 10-30mm, appropriate to the muscle targeted, attempting to elicit a local muscle response using the ''sparrow pecking'' technique. After the local twitch response was elicited or a reasonable attempt made, the needle was retained for a further ten minutes. The mean number of insertions was 3.3 [bib_ref] Trigger point acupuncture for treatment of knee osteoarthritis -a preliminary RCT for..., Itoh [/bib_ref].\n(iii) In the real acupuncture group, the acupuncture points Hegu (LI 4), Jiache (St 6), Xiaguan (St 7) and Yifeng (SJ 17) were used unilaterally on the tooth extraction side [bib_ref] Evaluation of acupuncture for pain control after oral surgery: a placebo-controlled trial, Lao [/bib_ref].\n\n## Item 2b\nNames (or location if no standard name) of points used (uni/ bilateral).\nExplanation. The point descriptions in the seminal classic texts, such as the Huangdi Neijing (Inner Canon of the Yellow Emperor) are rare and vague. The depiction of acupuncture points in relation to precise anatomical structures dates back only 100 years. Since the mid 1950s a process of standardisation has been taking place, and the acupuncture point descriptions based on anatomical locations and proportional cun measurement systems have served as a blueprint for many Western translations. It should be noted that these locations have not been universally adopted. Given this historical context, it remains important to know which acupuncture points have been used in clinical trials, with as accurate descriptions as possible of the location of these points, and where relevant the method used to identify the points.\nThe specific point locations used in treatments where standardised should be described in terms of an accepted nomenclature (e.g. GB21)or in terms of anatomical location where there is no accepted name. Whether the needles are inserted unilaterally or bilaterally should be stated. For protocols with partially individu-alised prescriptions, list any prescribed essential or optional points, and describe (in the Results section) both the points used at every visit, and all the points used on an ad hoc basis. If the list is extensive, the most commonly used points (with percentages) should be reported. Where protocols specify using fully individualised point prescriptions, authors should consider the best way to report the points used, for example by listing all points across all subjects, or by identifying the most commonly used points if the list is extensive.\nExamples. . The same points were treated for each affected leg. If both knees were affected, 9 needles were inserted in each leg [bib_ref] Effectiveness of acupuncture as adjunctive therapy in osteoarthritis of the knee: a..., Berman [/bib_ref].\n(ii) The VA (verum acupuncture) group received acupuncture with a 0.25640-mm stainless steel needle (Asia Med, Munich, Germany) at LI4, which is situated between the first two metacarpal bones on the dorsal side of both hands at the top of the muscle belly (figure provided) [bib_ref] Effects of verum acupuncture compared to placebo acupuncture on quantitative EEG and..., Streitberger [/bib_ref].\n\n## Item 2c\nDepth of insertion, based on a specified unit of measurement, or on a particular tissue level.\nExplanation. The depth of insertion should be expressed using the Chinese measurement of the cun; in terms of anatomical depth, for example, of subcutaneous tissue, fascia, muscle or periosteum; or in millimetres. For some trials, the protocol might specify the angle and direction of insertion along with depth of insertion, in which case these should also be reported.\nExamples. (i) All needle placements were performed by an experienced acupuncturist at a premarked depth of 4 mm from the tip of the needle [bib_ref] The electrophysiology of de qi sensations, Leung [/bib_ref].\n(ii) The depth of needle insertion varied with thickness of the skin and subcutaneous fatty tissues at the site of the acupuncture points; it was usually 1 to 1.5cm [bib_ref] A blinded randomised trial of acupuncture (manual and electroacupuncture) compared with a..., Jubb [/bib_ref].\n(iii) Shallow and light needling stimulation (1-2 mm) using fine needles (0.18-0.16 mm) inserted with the aid of insertion tubes was emphasized. Points were needled at a 10u-20u angle with a 2hand needling technique, generally in the direction of the flow of the channel [bib_ref] Development of protocols for randomized sham-controlled trials of complex treatment interventions: Japanese..., Schnyer [/bib_ref].\n\n## Item 2d\nResponses sought (e.g., de qi or muscle twitch response). Explanation. If the study protocol requires that specific responses to needling be elicited, for example the de qi sensation in traditional Chinese acupuncture, the muscle twitch in trigger point treatment or muscle contraction in electro-acupuncture, these elicited responses should be reported. Where relevant, the authors should differentiate between the responses required in the protocol and those actually obtained (which should be reported in the Results section).\nExamples. (i) The TRP (trigger point) group received treatment at trigger points. The correct application of the technique requires experience in palpation and localisation of taut muscle bands and myofascial trigger points. Precise needling of myofascial trigger points provokes a brief contraction of the muscle fibres. This local twitch response must be elicited for successful therapy but it may be painful and post treatment soreness is frequent [bib_ref] Trigger point acupuncture for treatment of knee osteoarthritis -a preliminary RCT for..., Itoh [/bib_ref].\n(ii) In contrast with TCM style acupuncture, we did not employ vigorous manipulation in order to elicit a strong de qi sensation (defined as a feeling of heaviness around the acupuncture point).(ref) Practitioners focused instead on feeling the response to stimulation as an ''echo'' sensation experienced on the receiving hand, while the active hand performed the actual needling. Attention was placed on reactivity or change in diagnostic areas, especially the pulse and abdomen. By carefully assessing changes in palpatory findings, the treatment was adjusted continuously based on the patient's response. Before needling, the ''live'' points were identified by palpation, that is, subtle changes at the skin level, or upon touch or pressure, for that particular patient [bib_ref] Development of protocols for randomized sham-controlled trials of complex treatment interventions: Japanese..., Schnyer [/bib_ref].\n\n## Item 2e\nNeedle stimulation (e.g. manual or electrical). Explanation. Needle stimulation techniques, where used, should be clearly described for all points. For manual stimulation, such techniques include lifting, thrusting or rotating the needle to manipulate the de qi sensation. For electrical stimulation, the current, amplitude and frequency settings should be recorded.\nExamples. (i) This mode of (manual) stimulation was provided via the acupuncture needles, which were placed in the premarked depth at the marked sites. The needle was rotated by an experienced acupuncturist with the index finger and thumb in an alternating clockwise and counterclockwise fashion at the rate of three to five rotations per second [bib_ref] The electrophysiology of de qi sensations, Leung [/bib_ref].\n(ii) Electrical stimulation was given to the anterior part of the knee for 10 minutes and then 10 minutes for the posterior part using a battery-operated, four-channel, 'AS Super 4' Electrostimulator (RDG Medical, Surrey UK) which generated low frequency, square-wave (2-10Hz) pulses of 1 millisecond duration for 10 minutes.(ref) In both groups, the apparatus was attached to needles at the two Xiyan points, SP9 and GB34, and BL40 and BL57. Electrical stimulation was delivered at 6Hz at a constant current. Voltage was set at a level just above the pain threshold [bib_ref] A blinded randomised trial of acupuncture (manual and electroacupuncture) compared with a..., Jubb [/bib_ref].\n\n## Item 2f\nNeedle retention time.\nExplanation. Needle retention times should be reported as either a standard or a mean and range. Authors should make it clear that they are reporting the time elapsed between the insertion and removal of needles (retention time) and distinguish it from treatment time, which may include other procedures such as history taking, discussion and preparation for treatment.\nExamples. (i) Each participant was treated bilaterally and had a total of six needles inserted for the duration of the treatment. A draining technique was used and the needles were left for a period of 30 minutes. The practitioner returned to check on the participant at regular intervals during the intervention [bib_ref] Effects of acupuncture as a treatment for hyperventilation syndrome: a pilot, randomized..., Gibson [/bib_ref].\n(ii) Needles were withdrawn immediately for tonification, and retained for up to 20 minutes for the evens technique [bib_ref] Acupuncture for irritable bowel syndrome an exploratory randomised controlled trial, Reynolds [/bib_ref].\n(iii) Therapists allow 25 (min) to 35 (max) minutes between insertion of the last needle and cessation of treatment and during that time they are to revisit the needles as appropriate [bib_ref] Is acupuncture a useful adjunct to physiotherapy for older adults with knee..., Hay [/bib_ref].\n(iv) The patients in group A were dry needled for a few seconds. For trigger point inactivation by dry needling… it is especially important not to apply too strong a stimulus because this may produce a flare-up of the patient's symptoms [bib_ref] Acupuncture versus metoprolol in migraine prophylaxis: a randomized trial of trigger point..., Hesse [/bib_ref].\n\n## Item 2g\nNeedle type (diameter, length, and manufacturer or material). Explanation. Details should be given of the types of needles used, including the diameter and length as well as the manufacturer and/or the material. This information is of importance since the effect of different metals or needle sizes on the body is not known. For trials using a variety of different types of needles, the ranges of diameters and lengths as well as types of material should be reported.\nExamples. (i) Seirin 36 gauge 2.5 inches long unused sterile L-type needles were used for the study [bib_ref] The electrophysiology of de qi sensations, Leung [/bib_ref].\n(ii) The VA (verum acupuncture) group received acupuncture with a 0.25640-mm stainless steel needle (Asia Med, Munich, Germany) at LI4 [bib_ref] Effects of verum acupuncture compared to placebo acupuncture on quantitative EEG and..., Streitberger [/bib_ref].\n\n## Stricta item 3: treatment regimen\n\n## Item 3a\nNumber of treatment sessions. Explanation. The planned number of sessions and frequency of treatment should be clearly documented. The actual number of treatments received by participants should be reported in the Results section. If there is variation between patients, then the mean and range should be reported.\nExamples. (i) The true acupuncture (experimental) group underwent 26 weeks of gradually tapering treatment according to the following schedule: 8 weeks of 2 treatments per week followed by 2 weeks of 1 treatment per week, 4 weeks of 1 treatment every other week, and 12 weeks of 1 treatment per month [bib_ref] Effectiveness of acupuncture as adjunctive therapy in osteoarthritis of the knee: a..., Berman [/bib_ref].\n(ii) In all groups, participants were asked to attend treatment sessions twice weekly for 12 weeks (24 treatments). We considered participants who attended 80% or more ($19 of 24) of acupuncture sessions to have completed a full course of treatment [bib_ref] A randomized clinical trial of acupuncture compared with sham acupuncture in fibromyalgia, Assefi [/bib_ref].\n\n## Item 3b\nFrequency and duration of treatment sessions. Explanation. The frequency and duration of sessions should be documented, with mean and range to be reported where there is variation across patients. Any variation in frequency of treatment (for example if subjects are to be treated twice weekly in the first two weeks then once a week for the next six weeks) should be clearly reported.\nExamples. (i) Acupuncture was administered a maximum of eight times, twice during each of the first three weeks and once during each of the following two weeks, for 30 minutes at each session. One month after this series of treatments had been completed and evaluated, the patients were offered a maximum of two follow up treatments of the same kind, one week apart [bib_ref] Intramuscular and periosteal acupuncture for anxiety and sleep quality in patients with..., Hansson [/bib_ref].\n\n## Stricta item 4: other components of treatment\n\n## Item 4a\nDetails of other interventions administered to the acupuncture group (e.g. moxibustion, cupping, herbs, exercises, lifestyle advice).\nExplanation. Additional components of treatment refer to the auxiliary techniques, prescribed self-treatment and lifestyle advice provided by the practitioner. All additional components, whether carried out by the practitioner or patient and whether integral or adjunctive to the acupuncture needling, should be described clearly. For acupuncture related interventions, such as moxibustion or cupping, detail should be provided equivalent to that recommended for acupuncture needling. If the protocol specifies the options of prescribed self-help treatments such as qigong or muscle stretching exercises, and/or lifestyle advice such as dietary changes based on acupuncture-related diagnostic criteria, then these too must be reported. The frequency with which the advice was given, and participants' compliance with this advice, should be reported. ''Other components of treatment'' should be distinguished from ''co-interventions'', that is interventions that are provided additionally to both groups, which should be fully reported as described in STRICTA Item (6b) below.\nExamples. (i) In addition to needling, moxibustion or thermal stimulation of the acupoints was used forming very fine wool of mugwort (Artemisa vulgaris) into minute, thread-size punks (okyū) and placing them on a thin layer of an herbal cream (shiunko). The moxa was lit with an incense stick and the process was repeated several times until warmth was felt by the patient [bib_ref] Development of protocols for randomized sham-controlled trials of complex treatment interventions: Japanese..., Schnyer [/bib_ref].\n(ii) Following application of the studs, patients were instructed to apply pressure to the stud by making small circular movements with the fingers of the opposite hand, 2-3 cycles per second for 1-2 minutes per point. As is typical for self-administered acupressure, patients were encouraged to apply acupressure this way on waking, in the early afternoon and during any exacerbation of symptoms. Initial instruction was provided verbally, at which time patients were asked to confirm their understanding by demonstrating the procedure. Patients also were given easy-to-read written materials describing the acupressure procedure.\n(iii) Chinese herbal medicine was to be taken three times per day over a period of 6 weeks and parallel to acupuncture treatment… All herbs used in the present study were imported from China by a single TCM herbal medicine import company (Sinores, Lueneberg, Germany)… All herbs were prepared in dried, minced pieces and then sealed in generic paper sachets by a pharmacist in order to render the herbal formulation non-identifiable for patients… In addition to the basic formula, every patient received a second additional formula tailored to his or her individual TCM diagnosis [bib_ref] Acupuncture and Chinese herbal medicine in the treatment of patients with seasonal..., Brinkhaus [/bib_ref].\n\n## Item 4b\nSetting and context of treatment, including instructions to practitioners and information and explanations to patients.\nExplanation. The setting and context of treatment can also provide important additional components to treatment [bib_ref] Context effects. Powerful therapies or methodological bias?, Blasi [/bib_ref]. Context includes instructions to practitioners that might modify their normal practice, for example, prescribing or proscribing explanations to patients about their diagnosis. For patients, the context includes the information they have been given about the trial that might be expected to modify outcomes. Therefore, the information that the patient receives regarding the treatment and control intervention should be reported, including any relevant wording on consent forms and information leaflets designed to influence beliefs or expectations. For example, describing a sham acupuncture control as ''a type of acupuncture'' may have a different effect on outcome than saying it is ''not acupuncture, but will involve a similar experience to acupuncture.''\nExamples. (i) The first acupuncturist was the ''diagnosing acupuncturist'' (DA), whom the patient saw for the initial consultation, and before and after each treatment. A full case history was taken by the DA, together with tongue and pulse examination, to arrive at an individual diagnosis in accordance with the principles of TCM, with an additional lesser emphasis on Five Element Acupuncture . Although all patients in the study had IBS, this corresponded to a wide range of TCM patterns, making individual diagnosis essential. Dietary and lifestyle advice (important in treatment according to TCM principles) was given to all patients by the DA, who then selected acupuncture points. The second ''treating acupuncturist'' (TA) opened the randomization envelope, and for the duration of the study remained the only individual aware of treatment allocation. The TA carried out the treatment -either according to instructions issued by the DA or using sham points, depending on the randomization [bib_ref] Acupuncture for irritable bowel syndrome: A blinded placebo-controlled trial, Forbes [/bib_ref].\n(ii) Patients were informed about acupuncture and minimal acupuncture in the study as follows: ''In this study, different types of acupuncture will be compared. One type is similar to the acupuncture treatment used in China. The other type does not follow these principles, but has also been associated with positive outcomes in clinical studies'' [bib_ref] Interventions and Physician Characteristics in a Randomized Multicenter Trial of Acupuncture in..., Brinkhaus [/bib_ref].\n\n## Stricta item 5: practitioner background\n\n## Item 5\nDescription of participating acupuncturists (qualification or professional affiliation, years in acupuncture practice, other relevant experience).\nExplanation. Characteristics of the acupuncturists providing treatment should be reported, including qualification or affiliation, years in acupuncture practice, as well as any other experience that may be relevant to the trial. Relevant differences (if any) in the qualification, training and experience of the participating acupuncturists should be highlighted. The recent survey of authors of acupuncture trials and reviews reinforced the need for these characteristics to be reported well [bib_ref] Assessing the utility of the standards for reporting trials of acupuncture (STRICTA):..., Prady [/bib_ref] , especially since the actual level of reporting has historically been poor [bib_ref] A Systematic Evaluation of the Impact of STRICTA and CONSORT Recommendations on..., Prady [/bib_ref]. In trials where different acupuncturists provide treatment to different treatment arms, the background of both groups should be reported. The eligibility criteria for acupuncturists should be explained, as these will influence generalisability of the trial results. Where there are known to be potential variations between practitioners, selecting a random sample of practitioners will reduce expertise bias and help improve the applicability of the results [bib_ref] Need for expertise based randomised controlled trials, Devereaux [/bib_ref].\nExamples. (i) Physicians had a median of 350 hours (range 140-2508 hours) of acupuncture training before participating in the trial; 33 (73%) had the B-Diploma. Seventeen (17; 38%) trial physicians taught acupuncture in accredited postgraduate courses. The physicians had used acupuncture in their practices for an average of 11 years (median 10, range 0-25) and had treated 346 patients (range 22-1200) with acupuncture in the year before the trial. Forty-one physicians (92%) indicated that they frequently or always make a Chinese syndrome diagnosis before starting treatment [bib_ref] Interventions and Physician Characteristics in a Randomized Multicenter Trial of Acupuncture in..., Brinkhaus [/bib_ref].\n(ii) Eight US-trained and licensed acupuncturists with a median of 10 years of experience (range 4-18 years) provided study treatments in their private offices. One investigator trained the acupuncturists in the study procedures to increase their comfort with delivering all 4 treatments and monitored compliance with the protocol throughout the study [bib_ref] A randomized clinical trial of acupuncture compared with sham acupuncture in fibromyalgia, Assefi [/bib_ref].\n(iii) Of the 11 midwives participating in the study, six had been taught acupuncture for midwives at the Norwegian School of Acupuncture/NFKA. These six gave real and false acupuncture, whereas the others, who had been trained in acupuncture by the six, were allowed only to give false acupuncture [bib_ref] Acupuncture in the management of pain in labor, Skilnand [/bib_ref].\n\n## Stricta item 6: control and comparator interventions\n\n## Item 6a\nRationale for the control or comparator in the context of the research question, with sources that justify the choice(s).\nExplanation. The rationale for choice of control or comparator should be presented and justified in relation to the research question and the methodology. In studies in which a group receiving acupuncture is compared with another group, the control or comparator can be sham acupuncture, usual care, an active treatment, a waiting list or no treatment. Whereas 'control' is sometimes used for a group that receives no intervention, the term 'comparator' may be more appropriate for an active intervention, such as physiotherapy, for which the intended action of the comparator is expected to be therapeutic. If using an acupuncturelike control in a participant-blinded trial then one of the following terms: active acupuncture control; penetrating needle control; or non-penetrating sham needling control might be helpful descriptors. Control procedures involving invasive or non-invasive sham needling techniques may be therapeutically active, evoking neurophysiological and/or localised immune and circulatory responses. The extent that sham acupuncture needling, whether penetrating or not, might elicit acupuncture-specific physiological mechanisms is not known, and is in part a consequence of our lack of knowledge of the mechanism(s) of true acupuncture. There are also variations in assumptions about the precision required for point location, as for some clinicians and investigators, acupuncture points are considered as areas of reactivity rather than points of action. Such assumptions have a bearing on the integrity of the sham as an appropriate control. Some non-needling control procedures can be assumed to be physiologically inert, such as an inactivated transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) machine; however, these procedures may not have the same total psychophysiological credibility as acupuncture, thereby compromising the interpretation of the results. Sources that led to the choice of control, such as literature or expert opinion, should also be reported and referenced. The author should reference prior work that supports the use of the selected comparator, such as from the conclusion of a systematic review or from another randomised controlled trial.\nExamples. (i) 'Sham' acupuncture points were chosen from three different areas on the body (the anterior thigh distally, the posterior thigh, and the lateral aspect of the lower back), which do not correspond to recognized acupuncture points and are deemed to have no therapeutic value [bib_ref] Acupuncture for irritable bowel syndrome: A blinded placebo-controlled trial, Forbes [/bib_ref].\n(ii) International guidelines suggest that the best package of care for this patient group is one that includes patient education, advice and exercise (ref). …. Randomised clinical trials consistently show the benefit of exercise for knee pain in older adults . Recent studies also highlight the need to provide adequate instruction, feedback and practice in order to ensure that the key muscle groups around the knee, such as the quadriceps, are activated (ref). The European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) recommendations have recently been updated and in particular, advocate exercise for knee pain related to osteoarthritis (ref). In line with this evidence base, the current trial was designed so that all participants receive a package of care which includes education, advice, and exercise [bib_ref] Is acupuncture a useful adjunct to physiotherapy for older adults with knee..., Hay [/bib_ref].\n(iii) For this study a special 'placebo needle' was designed by Streitberger. The needle body is not fixed inside the copper handle. Its tip is blunt and when it touches the skin, a small pricking sensation is felt by the patient, simulating the puncture of the skin. The handle of the needle moves over the needle, the needle is shortened. Patients 'see' the needle moving inside their body… This needle was tested in 60 volunteers and proved to be sufficiently credible to be used in our clinical trial as a control(ref) [bib_ref] Randomised clinical trial comparing the effects of acupuncture and a newly designed..., Kleinhenz [/bib_ref].\n\n## Item 6b\nPrecise description of the control or comparator. If sham acupuncture or any other type of acupuncture-like control is used, provide details as for Items 1 to 3 above.\nExplanation. A precise description of the components of the control or comparator should be presented. If the control treatment is an acupuncture-like intervention, such as a form of sham acupuncture, then it should be specified whether the sham is invasive (penetrating the skin) or non-invasive (non-penetrating). The theoretical basis, needling details and regimen of an acupuncture-like control need to be reported in the same way as is set out in STRICTA Items 1 to 3 above. The lack of a world-wide consensus on the location and size of acupuncture points reinforces the importance of accurate documentation of the sham points actually used, their precise location and the method used to locate them. If usual care or another active treatment is the comparator, all the components should be reported in full detail. This will enable readers to compare usual care as provided in the trial with what is usually provided to participants in another setting. Where usual care is also provided to those receiving acupuncture, these data will also allow readers to compare the intensity of usual care in the comparator arm with that of the experimental arm. If it is a waitlist arm, then the period of waiting needs to be specified. While precise description of the control or comparator is fairly straightforward in principle, the more complex the components, the more care is required to specify them precisely.\nExamples. (i) Acupuncturists inserted 2 needles into the sham points in the abdominal area, approximately 3 cm lateral to and slightly above the umbilicus bilaterally, and then immediately applied 2 pieces of adhesive tape next to the needles. In addition, they tapped a mock plastic needle guiding tube on the surface of each of the 9 true points in the leg to produce some discernible sensation and then immediately applied a needle with a piece of adhesive tape to the dermal surface, without needle insertion, of each point for a total of 20 minutes. The sham acupuncture procedure was given on the same schedule as the experimental group and used the same active needle placements, except actual insertion did not occur at these 9 points. Although electrical stimulation did not occur, a mock transelectrical stimulation unit (which emitted a sound and possessed a blinking light) was attached to the sham needles at the knee. To facilitate blinding, we used screens in both treatment and sham groups that were placed below the abdomen to prevent participants from actually observing the true or sham procedures at the knee area but to allow them to observe the procedure being performed in the abdomen area [bib_ref] Effectiveness of acupuncture as adjunctive therapy in osteoarthritis of the knee: a..., Berman [/bib_ref].\n(ii) In each session, at least 5 out of 10 predefined distant nonacupuncture points (ref) were needled bilaterally (at least 10 needles) and superficially using fine needles (ie, minimal acupuncture). ''De Qi'' and manual stimulation of the needles were avoided. All acupuncturists received oral instructions, a videotape, and a brochure with detailed information on sham acupuncture [bib_ref] Acupuncture for patients with migraine: a randomized controlled trial, Linde [/bib_ref].\n(iii) Conservative therapy involved 10 visits to practitioners with consultation and a prescription for diclofenac, up to 150 mg/d, or rofecoxib, 25 mg/d, as needed until week 23 [bib_ref] Acupuncture and knee osteoarthritis, Scharf [/bib_ref].\n(iv) Patients received the same treatment as in the standard group but in addition did stabilising exercises modified because of the pregnancy.(refs) The training programme started by emphasising activation and control of local deep lumbopelvic muscles. Training of more superficial muscles in dynamic exercises to improve mobility, strength, and endurance capacity was gradually included. Patients received treatments individually for a total of six hours during six weeks. They were told to integrate the exercises in daily activities and to exercise in short sessions on several occasions during the day [bib_ref] Effects of acupuncture and stabilising exercises as adjunct to standard treatment in..., Elden [/bib_ref].\n\n# Discussion\nThis revised STRICTA Statement has been designed to help improve the reporting of interventions in clinical trials of acupuncture, with the intention that it will help authors of acupuncture trials provide readers with a clear, accurate and transparent account of their acupuncture protocols as well as their control and/or comparator procedures. In addition to revising the STRICTA checklist, we have improved the explanations of each item and provided examples of good reporting. To enhance awareness, endorsement and adherence, the revised STRICTA Statement has been developed as an extension to CONSORT. Authors of clinical trials of acupuncture should use the STRICTA recommendations for the acupuncture intervention (Item 5 in the CONSORT 2010 Statement) in conjunction with the other 25 items of the checklist in the main CONSORT guidelines [bib_ref] CONSORT 2010 Explanation and Elaboration: updated guidelines for reporting parallel group randomised..., Moher [/bib_ref]. The extension to CONSORT for non-pharmacological interventions is also highly relevant to acupuncture trials [bib_ref] Extending the CONSORT statement to randomized trials of nonpharmacologic treatment: explanation and..., Boutron [/bib_ref] [bib_ref] Methods and processes of the CONSORT Group: example of an extension for..., Boutron [/bib_ref]. There are other extensions to CONSORT that may be relevant, depending on the type of trial design, including extensions for cluster trials, equivalence and non-inferiority trials, and pragmatic trials, and the reporting of abstracts and of harms (e.g. adverse events) associated with the intervention. The most recent versions of all CONSORT guidance documents can be found on the CONSORT website (http://www.consort-statement.org).\nA complete, accurate and transparent trial report facilitates dissemination, interpretation, translation and replicability. There continues to be a need for better reporting generally, as has been highlighted in a recent study of what is missing from descriptions of treatments in trials and reviews [bib_ref] What is missing from descriptions of treatment in trials and reviews, Glasziou [/bib_ref]. The authors found that elements of the intervention were missing in half of the published articles that they reviewed, giving insufficient detail, for example, with practitioners unable to use the treatments as described and researchers unable to replicate studies. This finding is similar to that from a review of authors of acupuncture trials [bib_ref] Assessing the utility of the standards for reporting trials of acupuncture (STRICTA):..., Prady [/bib_ref]. Improved reporting reduces reader ambiguity in interpretation, is likely to increase credibility and application of the results by providing better evidence on which to base decisions on patient care.\nReporting guidelines do help improve the quality of reporting randomized trials [bib_ref] Does the CONSORT checklist improve the quality of reports of randomised controlled..., Plint [/bib_ref] although it is difficult to observe their maximal benefit because too few journals endorse reporting guidelines [bib_ref] Endorsement of the CONSORT Statement by high impact factor medical journals: a..., Hopewell [/bib_ref] and fewer adhere to them [bib_ref] Endorsement of the CONSORT Statement by high impact factor medical journals: a..., Hopewell [/bib_ref]. To maximize this potential, we encourage journals to unambiguously endorse the revised STRICTA reporting guidelines. This can be most readily achieved by updating journal Instructions to Authors, thereby alerting prospective authors. In addition, we encourage journals to implement strategies to improve author adherence to reporting guidelines. These efforts might also help peer reviewers and journal editors in deliberating the merits of such trials.\n[fig] 2: Details of needling 2a) Number of needle insertions per subject per session (mean and range where relevant) 2b) Names (or location if no standard name) of points used (uni/bilateral) 2c) Depth of insertion, based on a specified unit of measurement, or on a particular tissue level 2d) Response sought (e.g. de qi or muscle twitch response) 2e) Needle stimulation (e.g. manual, electrical) 2f) Needle retention time 2g) Needle type (diameter, length, and manufacturer or material) 3.

{"guideline_text": "Cervical vertebrae\n\n# Overview\nIn vertebrates, cervical vertebrae (singular: vertebra) are those vertebrae immediately behind (caudal to) the skull.\n\n# Variation among species\nIn some species, some parts of the skull may be composed of vertebra-like elements, e.g. the occipital bone in humans is composed of four vertebra-like segments.\nIn many vertebrate species, cervical vertebrae are variable in number; however, almost all mammals have seven (including those with very short necks, such as elephants or whales, and those with very long necks, such as giraffes).\nThe few exceptions include the manatee and the two-toed sloth, which each have only six cervical vertebrae, and the three-toed sloth with nine cervical vertebrae.\nThoracic vertebrae in all species are defined as those vertebrae which also carry a pair of ribs, and lie caudal to the cervical vertebrae.\nIn humans, cervical vertebrae are the smallest of the true vertebrae, and can be readily distinguished from those of the thoracic or lumbar regions by the presence of a foramen (hole) in each transverse process, through which passes the vertebral artery.\nThe remainder of this article focuses upon human anatomy.\n\n# General characteristics (C3-C6)\nThese are the general characteristics of the third through sixth cervical vertebrae. (The first, second, and seventh vertebrae are extraordinary, and detailed later.)\nThe body of these four vertebrae is small, and broader from side to side than from front to back.\nThe anterior and posterior surfaces are flattened and of equal depth;\nthe former is placed on a lower level than the latter, and its inferior border is prolonged downward, so as to overlap the upper and forepart of the vertebra below.\nThe upper surface is concave transversely, and presents a projecting lip on either side;\nthe lower surface is concave from front to back, convex from side to side, and presents laterally shallow concavities which receive the corresponding projecting lips of the underlying vertebra.\nThe pedicles are directed laterally and backward, and are attached to the body midway between its upper and lower borders, so that the superior vertebral notch is as deep as the inferior, but it is, at the same time, narrower.\nThe laminae are narrow, and thinner above than below; the vertebral foramen is large, and of a triangular form.\nThe spinous process is short and bifid, the two divisions being often of unequal size.\nThe superior and inferior articular processes of neighboring vertebrae often fuse on either or both sides to form an articular pillar, a column of bone which projects laterally from the junction of the pedicle and lamina.\nThe articular facets are flat and of an oval form:\n- the superior face backward, upward, and slightly medially.\n- the inferior face forward, downward, and slightly laterally.\nThe transverse processes are each pierced by the foramen transversarium, which, in the upper six vertebrae, gives passage to the vertebral artery and vein, as well as a plexus of sympathetic nerves.\nEach process consists of an anterior and a posterior part.\nThe anterior portion is the homologue of the rib in the thoracic region, and is therefore named the costal process or costal element.\nIt arises from the side of the body, is directed laterally in front of the foramen, and ends in a tubercle, the anterior tubercle.\nThe posterior part, the true transverse process, springs from the vertebral arch behind the foramen, and is directed forward and laterally; it ends in a flattened vertical tubercle, the posterior tubercle.\nThese two parts are joined, outside the foramen, by a bar of bone which exhibits a deep sulcus on its upper surface for the passage of the corresponding spinal nerve.\n\n# Special cervical vertebrae (C1, C2, and C7)\n- C1 or atlas: The Atlas is the topmost vertebra, and – along with C2 – forms the joint connecting the skull and spine. Its chief peculiarity is that it has no body, and this is due to the fact that the body of the atlas has fused with that of the next vertebra.\n- C2 or axis: It forms the pivot upon which C1 rotates. The most distinctive characteristic of this bone is the strong odontoid process (dens) which rises perpendicularly from the upper surface of the body. The body is deeper in front than behind, and prolonged downward anteriorly so as to overlap the upper and front part of the third vertebra.\n- C7 or vertebra prominens: The most distinctive characteristic of this vertebra is the existence of a long and prominent spinous process, hence the name vertebra prominens. In some subjects, the seventh cervical vertebra is associated with an abnormal pair of ribs, known as cervical ribs. These ribs are usually small, but may occasionally compress blood vessels (such as the subclavian artery) or nerves in the brachial plexus, causing unpleasant symptoms.\n\n# Movements of the cervical spine\nThe movements of flexion and extension of the head take place predominantly at the joint between the first cervical vertebra and the occipital bone, the atlanto-occipital joint. However, the cervical spine is comparatively mobile, and some component of this movement is due to flexion and extension of the vertebral column itself.\nThe movement of rotating the head to left and right happens almost entirely at the joint between the first and second cervical vertebrae, the atlanto-axial joint. A small amount of rotation of the vertebral column itself contributes to the movement.\n\n# Landmarks\nThe thyroid cartilage is from C4 to C5.\nThe cricoid cartilage is from C6 to C7.\n\n# Clinical significance\nInjuries to the cervical spine are common at the level of the second cervical vertebrae, but neurological injury is uncommon.\nIf it does occur, however, it may cause death or profound disability, including paralysis of the arms, legs, and diaphragm, which leads to respiratory failure.\nCommon patterns of injury include the odontoid fracture and the hangman's fracture, both of which are often treated with immobilization in a cervical collar or Halo brace.\n\n# Additional images\n- Cervical column\n- First cervical vertebra, or Atlas\n- Second cervical vertebra, or epistropheus, from above.\n- Second cervical vertebra, epistropheus, or axis, from the side.\n- Seventh cervical vertebra.\n- Vertebral column.\n- Posterior atlantoöccipital membrane and atlantoaxial ligament.\n- Median sagittal section through the occipital bone and first three cervical vertebræ.\n- Section of the neck at about the level of the sixth cervical vertebra.\n\n# Cervical Degenerative Disc Disease\nIn between the cervical vertebrae are intervertebral discs.  These discs are made of a flexible material that act as shock absorbers.  In all humans, these discs naturally shrink over time.  They can also shrink due to being damaged, either by trauma or overuse. The speed at which they degenerate can also be genetic.  In any case, when a disc shrinks, at a minimum it causes the vertebra in the neck to become unstable.  The body recognizes this physiological change and tries to compensate by growing new bone in and around the affected vertebrae.  This bone growth is called bone spurs.  This can cause irritation and inflammation which results in arthritis.  In the worst case, the disc not only shrinks but can bulge or split open.  If this happens the protrusion can press on the adjacent nerves and cause pain and symptoms like tingling, numbing, and weakness in one or both arms.  A person may have all or none of these symptoms regardless of the severity of disc degeneration.  Treatment of this condition is done in many ways.  The first method is conservative and involves the patient resting, performing neck stretching exercises, traction, and taking non steroidal anti-inflammatory medication.  This is usually enough for most cases.  In cases that do not respond to conservative treatment, other methods are considered.  The gold standard at this time is disc fusion.  Fusion involves removal of the diseased disc, then prepping the space where the disc was.  A piece of bone is then inserted to fill the space where the disc was and two metal stabilizers are screwed to the vertebrae above and below the disc cavity.  The body then grafts to the new bone creating a solid connection between the two vertebra.  This returns the area of the neck to stability and stops the bone spurs from growing.  It also relieves and pressure on the adjacent nerves due to the spurs and the bulging disc.  This usually causes the inflammation to go down and the arthritis to subside.  However, this technique has a negative side effect.  Because the upper and lower vertebra are now solidly connected, the shock of the neck movement in that area is projected onto the adjacent discs.  This can cause the adjacent discs to degenerate a quicker rate then they would normally.  Depending on how quickly this occurs the patient could have problems in the adjacent discs.  A relatively new treatment method has recently been introduced called cervical disc replacement.  This involves removing the diseased disc and replacing it with an artificial one.  The replacement is meant to restore flexibility and movement to the area.  Because of this the adjacent discs are not adversely loaded with extra shock caused by normal neck movement.  This type of treatment looks promising, however there is much to overcome to do it successfully.  It is absolutely necessary that the artificial disc not move at all when it is implanted.  The disc must not touch any of the adjacent nerves and especially the spinal cord.\n\n# Soft Tissue Damage and Instability Conditions of the Upper Cervical Joints\nCranio-atlanto-axial instability can be caused by torn or overstretched alar ligaments and/or of the ligamentum transversum - often in combination with injured (ruptured) facet joints of the upper cervical vertebrae.\nSuch injuries are often caused by severe whiplash movement.", "source": "wikidoc", "question": "According to authoritative guidelines, discuss the recommended management pathway for an adult with symptomatic cervical degenerative disc disease, including first‑line conservative measures, the indications and rationale for proceeding to surgical anterior disc removal with fusion versus cervical disc replacement, and the expected benefits and potential adverse effects (including the risk of adjacent‑segment degeneration) that should inform clinical decision‑making."}
{"guideline_text": "# INTRODUCTION Introduction\nAction on the guidance in these guidelines requires a strategy appropriate to the local context. Planning, decision-making and monitoring are parts of an ongoing process. Once a plan is developed and implemented, it must be monitored and evaluated. The resulting findings then inform revision of the strategy and its implementation.\n\n# Situational analysis\nData and a strong evidence base should guide the response, but lack of this information is not a reason to stop or not initiate a response to improve the health of key populations and work towards the elimination of HIV, viral hepatitis and STIs as public health threats.\nParticularly when programmes and services are first being developed, it is important to undertake a situational analysis. For a local response to be appropriate, acceptable and most effective, risks and needs must be examined locally, and local key population members must be consulted and actively involved in this situational analysis. Local people from key populations should ideally be drawn from networks, where they exist, or people acknowledged as community leaders who can represent community opinions.\nIt is critical to understand the dynamics of local epidemics; the characteristics of the populations affected; the physical, social and political environments that influence risk and vulnerability; the specific needs of people from key populations, and any factors that might enable or hinder efforts to address these needs; and the health systems and community infrastructure. With this information in hand, an evidence-informed plan can be developed and implemented.\nAs already described, people from key populations face elevated HIV, viral hepatitis and STI risk and burden, and have specific and sometimes complex health-related needs. While many of these risks and needs may be common across key populations in different settings, some factors will differ among key populations, and some will be specific to a particular context.\nIt is also important to recognize the diversity and varying levels of risk within each key population. In many settings, those most at risk are likely to be people who could be considered members of more than one key population; for example, some men who have sex with men may also inject drugs or engage in sex work. People from key populations may also have other characteristics that could increase their risk or vulnerability, or create additional health or welfare needs. For example, people from key populations may be homeless, impoverished, educationally disadvantaged, disabled, experience mental health conditions, or have other acute or chronic health concerns. - Managers and health care workers from the following fields in both the public and private sectors: HIV programmes and clinics, hepatology service providers, sexual and reproductive health programmes and clinics, including family planning and STIs, maternal and child health, mental health, TB services, drug dependence, NSPs, OAMT services and prison health programmes;\n- Civil society, including people living with HIV and viral hepatitis, women's and youth groups, religious leaders and people with disabilities;\n- Technical specialists in specific areas, such as laboratory services, pharmacology, drug resistance, toxicity management, supply chains and community health;\n- Government partners, including representatives of relevant ministries, such as health, justice and law enforcement, internal affairs, finance, planning and regional (such as provincial) authorities;\n- Non-governmental organizations, including international agencies, faith-based organizations, other local nongovernmental and community-based organizations, and private-sector service organizations;\n- Finance and budget experts, such as programme budget officers and health economists;\n- Academic institutions, including experts in operational research, implementation science, ethics, training and supervision;\n- International donors and implementers;\n- Human rights institutions; and\n- Professional associations of various cadres of health workers (such as physicians, nurses and community health workers).\nThe makeup, characteristics and needs of key populations change over time, as do various contextual and environmental factors. Updating a situational analysis through ongoing monitoring and evaluation will identify changing parameters, and make it possible to refine or refocus the response.\nA situational analysis will almost certainly identify gaps in knowledge. An agenda for further research can address these gaps.\nIt is also important, whenever analysing and interpreting data, to evaluate the quality of the data and the presence of any sources of bias. In settings where services for key populations are not well established, and where much of the information listed above has not been previously compiled, undertaking a rapid assessment may be appropriate. Rapid assessment and response guides are available to help guide initial and ongoing assessments, using multiple methods to gather data and to conduct analyses at multiple levels. These guides focus largely on HIV, and were developed earlier in the HIV epidemic, but the principles and methods described remain relevant to gathering information on HIV, as well as viral hepatitis and STIs: Planning and implementing the response The effectiveness of the interventions included in the essential health interventions package is well established. Experience in multiple countries has demonstrated the generalizability of these interventions in diverse settings. While national strategies should be guided by the health intervention packages recommended in these guidelines, local factors do have a bearing on intervention effectiveness and impact, and have a bearing on how an intervention is implemented to optimize access and effectiveness. With the information gathered on the local setting, as described above, planning processes should be taken forward with participation of stakeholders, particularly key populations, and decisions can be made on how interventions should be implemented.\nThe following are some of the decisions that need to be taken while developing and implementing a national response to HIV, viral hepatitis and STIs among key populations. Guidance on planning and implementing the response is listed in Box 3.\nTargeting the response - Which key populations and which subgroups within key populations are most at risk?\n- Which strategies, legislation, policies and guidelines need to be developed or revised? Implementation - Are key populations' members effectively leading the response?\n- Which interventions need to be implemented and where, and how should implementation be prioritized?\n- How can services addressing HIV, viral hepatitis, STIs and broader health be integrated at the organizational, service and site levels (see the service delivery chapter) to optimize accessibility and impact for key populations?\n- Where and at what scale do interventions need to be provided?\n- What targets and timelines should be set for the implementation and scale-up of interventions?\n- How and to what extent should services be decentralized and integrated to provide the best service coverage for key populations?\n- Which modes of service delivery are most appropriate?\n- What are the roles and responsibilities of the various stakeholders in implementing the response and achieving the agreed targets?\n- What financial, human and other resources and infrastructure are required to implement the response? What resources are currently available, what additional inputs will be required and how might these be obtained? What types of health care and other workers (including key population peers) are required, and how will they be recruited and trained? How can task shifting and sharing optimize the use of available human resources and expand service delivery?\n- How will economies of scale and synergies among interventions save on costs and improve service provision?\n- What resources are available from donor organizations and what resources will need to be mobilized from national sources? Greater funding for HIV may be available through The Global Fund and PEPFAR, but funds for STIs and viral hepatitis may need to be integrated in national plans.\n\n# Monitoring and evaluation\n- How will implementation of the response be monitored and evaluated?\n- How do strategic information systems for M&E need to be strengthened?\n\n# Monitoring and evaluating the responses\nMonitoring and evaluation is an essential part of the HIV, viral hepatitis and STI response for key populations A monitoring and evaluation system is needed to assess both structural and health sector components of the response to HIV, viral hepatitis and STIs in key populations. It is critical that these systems are practical, not overly complicated, and that they collect information that is current, useful and readily used while adhering to human rights principals as described previously.\nWHO and UN partner agencies have developed frameworks for monitoring the response to HIV in the general population and key populations. The following documents described these frameworks:\n- Tool to set and monitor targets for HIV prevention, diagnosis, treatment and care for key populations. Geneva: WHO; 2015;\n- Consolidated strategic information guidelines for viral hepatitis: planning and tracking progress towards elimination. Geneva: WHO; 2019;\n- Consolidated guidelines on person-centred HIV patient monitoring and case surveillance. Geneva: WHO; 2017;\n- Consolidated HIV strategic information guidelines: driving impact through programme monitoring and management. Geneva: WHO; 2020;\n- Strategies and laboratory methods for strengthening surveillance of sexually transmitted infection. Geneva: WHO; 2012.\nThese frameworks recommend sets of national-level indicators. These indicators assess key factors related to the enabling environment; measure the availability, coverage and quality of specific interventions; and examine their outcome and impact (Box 4). The indicators can also be used when preparing proposals or reporting progress to donor organizations.\nThe M&E process requires data from a variety of sources, including behavioural and serosurveillance surveys, programmatic and administrative data, community-led monitoring as well as information gathered through reviewing policy documents and legislation, and consultation with experts and stakeholders (Box 5). The quality and limitations of these data should be assessed and considered when undertaking analysis and interpretation. Ongoing planning and development of the response Setting clear, achievable but ambitious targets is crucial when planning to scale-up interventions to have an impact on HIV, viral hepatitis and STIs. Targets concretely define what a successful national programme or project should achieve within a specified timeframe. Targets can be set for both intervention-specific indicators and cross-cutting outcome and impact indicators (Box 4).\nIntervention and enabling environment indicators reflect the availability, coverage and quality of an intervention or service, or assess changes in environmental factors, such as revision of legislation, within a specified timeframe. Targets are set with the aims of achieving reductions in HIV, viral hepatitis and STI risk, sufficiently to reduce transmission and ensure the adequate provision of appropriate treatment and care for those living with HIV, viral hepatitis or with an STI.\nOutcome and impact indicators seek to gauge the impact that interventions have had on outcomes that affect exposure to risk, such as changes in risk behaviours (for example, the percentage of people who use condoms consistently) or on impacts on the course of HIV, viral hepatitis or STI epidemics; for example, reductions in incidence of HIV, viral hepatitis or STIs (Box 4).\nLike planning overall, the target-setting process should be collaborative, involving a range of stakeholders. Those setting the targets should consider whether they are realistic and whether data can be practically collected. Targets, in keeping with programme strategies, should be tailored to the local epidemic and what the strategy can realistically achieve with obtainable funding and resources. Modelling can help to identify how different target levels would affect epidemics.\nBaseline assessment -initial assessment should measure the scale of the current response, assessing the availability, coverage and quality of current interventions, and appraise current environmental enablers and barriers using agreed indicators. This information serves as a baseline for tracking progress. Also, currently available resources and technical capacity must be determined to estimate what more is needed, and how to scale the intervention appropriately. From this information, realistic, achievable targets can be set and the timeframe specified.\nEstimating cost associated with implementation is a key step in planning the roll-out. Several costing tools and resources are available. Spectrum, for example, is a suite of models and analytical tools to support decision-making for HIV and STI programming. It comprises several software apps, including AIM (AIDS Impact Model) and Goals (Cost and Impact of HIV Interventions). Most countries already have AIM files prepared as part of their national epidemiological estimates, and so both modules can be rapidly applied. Spectrum can be accessed online at: / QuickStartGuide_Spectrum_en.pdf.\nOneHealth is a software tool designed to strengthen health system analysis and costing, and to develop financing scenarios at the country level. It is specifically designed for LMICs. It provides planners with a single framework for planning, costing, impact analysis, budgeting and financing of strategies for all major diseases and health system components. OneHealth can be downloaded free of charge (Avenir Health, 2021) at: .\nUNAIDS has developed The Human Rights Costing Tool (HRCT), a flexible tool for costing investments in critical enablers (such as integrated treatment and rights literacy programmes, legal services, stigma and discrimination reduction programmes, and training for health care workers and law enforcement). This, too, can be downloaded free of charge along with a user guide at: / The_Human_Rights_Costing_Tool_v_1_5_May-2012.xlsm and / unaids/contentassets/documents/document/2012/The_HRCT_User_Guide_FINAL_2012-07-09.pdf.\n\n# WHO commissioned Avenir Health to develop the Syphilis Interventions Towards Elimination (SITE)\ntool which is a dynamic transmission model to evaluate and project the impact, cost and costeffectiveness of syphilis interventions (screening, treatment and prevention) to support national control programmes: .\n\n# Box 4. Indicators for monitoring and evaluating the response\nTo understand how well the response is functioning and its effects, its various key requirements need to be monitored for each key population. For each of these requirements there are a number of useful indicators.\nThese indicators are described in detail in WHO key population guidance:\n- Tool to set and monitor targets for HIV prevention, diagnosis, treatment and care for key populations. Geneva: WHO; 2015\n- Consolidated strategic information guidelines for viral hepatitis: planning and tracking progress towards elimination. Geneva: WHO; 2019 Specific impact indicators related to validating elimination of viral hepatitis in people who inject drugs can be found in:\n- Interim guidance for country validation of viral hepatitis elimination. Geneva: WHO; 2021\n\n# Successful implementation and impact requires supportive policy, legislation and other structural factors.\nMeasured by structural (or enabling environment) indicators:\n- audit of current legislation and policy;\n- number of key population-led organizations;\n- achievement of meaningful involvement of people from key populations in policy and strategy formulation;\n- legal support services for key populations have been established;\n- support services for people from key populations who experience violence are functioning;\n- sensitization training on key populations is regularly conducted for law enforcement officers; and\n- sensitization training on key populations is regularly conducted for health care and social services providers.\n\n# Interventions need to be accessible to people from key populations.\nMeasured by availability indicators:\n- the number of sites where each intervention is available, including availability of online interventions;\n- the number and percentage of key population-focused programme sites where the intervention is provided;\n- the number and percentage of mainstream programme sites where the intervention is provided and that meet key population sensitization standards;\n- the percentage of all sites where the intervention is currently provided that are either mainstream programmes meeting key population sensitization standards, or are key population-focused programmes;\n- the percentage of the key population sample reporting that the intervention is readily accessible; and\n\n# Measured by coverage indicators:\n- number and percentage of key population provided with the intervention during a specified reporting period;\n- number of consumable items (such as needles and syringes or condoms) distributed per member of key population during a specified reporting period; and\n- percentage of the key population sample reporting that they received the intervention during a specified reporting period.\n\n# Interventions need to be properly implemented to be effective.\nMeasured by quality indicators:\n- review of programme policy and practice using programme quality assessment checklist;\n- percentage of staff that has received key population sensitization training;\n- percentage of key population reporting intervention was received, and also a specific important activity or service was delivered (such as the provision of compatible lubricant with condoms); and\n- percentage of occasions when intervention was provided, along with specific important activity of service (see previous).\n\n# Intended aims should be achieved.\nMeasured by outcome and impact indicators:\n- prevalence of risk behaviour in key population;\n- incidence of HIV, viral hepatitis and STI infections in key populations;\n- prevalence of infection in key population;\n- incidence of HIV-related mortality in key population;\n- prevalence in key population of experiencing stigma or discrimination; and\n- incidence of violence against people from key population. Behavioural and sero-surveillance surveys. These surveys of key populations can provide prevalence data and information on the experiences, risks and service utilization of people from these groups. Many countries already undertake bio-behavioural surveys of key populations periodically as part of the ongoing monitoring of the HIV and viral hepatitis epidemics. The generalizability of survey findings depends on how representative the sample is of the entire key population; it is important to consider selection bias in how participants were recruited. Behavioural surveys are susceptible to bias toward socially desirable responses and to recall bias.\nProgrammatic or administrative data. Most programmes routinely record at least some basic information when providing a service. This might include the number of people who received a service, basic information about the client, and numbers of supplies used or distributed. To assess services provided to people from key populations requires programme data to be disaggregated by key population, where information on key population status and behaviours can be collected safely and securely and where feasible. Key population-focused programmes may be able to provide data specific to the populations they serve, but this information is not commonly available from programmes that provide services to many different groups or to the general population.\n\n# Desk review and expert consultation.\nReviewing various policy documents and legislation can identify the presence or absence of various laws or policies that may affect people from key populations.\nPopulation size estimation. Deriving reliable population size estimates for key populations can be challenging. Various methods can be employed; each has its own advantages and limitations. Common methods include census and enumeration, general population surveys, and capture-recapture, multiplier and network scale-up methods. Deriving multiple estimates through different methodologies and triangulating the results is helpful. Definitions of key populations should be clear.\nAs highlighted in previous chapters, this updated guidelines contains seven new recommendations or new practice statements that are included in the overall framework of health interventions and service delivery.\nWHO developed seven PICO questions. In an online survey, the Guideline Development Group members ranked the importance of each outcome to those affected by the intervention using the GRADE rating scale of 1-9 (0-3: not important; 4-6: important; 7-9: critical). Once the PICO question and priority outcomes were agreed, external researchers, supported by the WHO team, conducted a systematic review of the evidence.\nThe systematic review teams developed protocols and conducted a systematic review of the relevant scientific evidence. The appointed independent methodologist assessed and reviewed the protocols, as did the Steering Group, key population networks and WHO technical officers. The methodologist advised the review team on analytical decisions and synthesis and the grading of evidence. Studies providing information on feasibility, values and preferences, and cost-effectiveness were also included and summarized. The scientific evidence supporting the recommendations was evaluated using the GRADE approach, and the effectiveness and overall certainty of evidence for each intervention was determined. The risk of bias for studies included in systematic reviews were assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration's risk of bias tool for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) (334) and the ROBINS-I tool for non-randomized studies (335).\nWHO also commissioned four global networks of key populations (men who have sex with men, sex workers, trans and gender diverse people, and people who inject drugs) to undertake new qualitative research on values and preferences among their networks. The results formed part of the evidence synthesis. Further details are provided in the next section.\n\n# Table 2. Domains considered when assessing the strength of recommendations\n\n# Domain Rationale\n\n# Benefits and harm\nWhen a new recommendation is developed, desirable effects (benefits) need to be weighed against undesirable effects (risks or harm), considering any previous recommendation or an alternative. The larger the gap or gradient in favour of the benefits over the risks, the more likely that a strong recommendation will be made.\n\n# Certainty of evidence\nHigh certainty of evidence is likely to lead to a strong recommendation.\n\n# Values and preferences\nIf the recommendation is likely to be widely accepted or highly valued, it is likely that a strong recommendation will be made. If there is a great deal of variability or strong reasons why the recommended course of action is unlikely to be accepted, it is more likely that a conditional recommendation will be made.\n\n# Cost and financial implications\nLower costs (monetary, infrastructure, equipment or human resources) or greater costeffectiveness contribute to a strong recommendation.\nIf an intervention is achievable in a setting where the greatest impact is expected, a strong recommendation is appropriate.\n\n# Equity and human rights\nIf the recommendation is likely to increase access to an intervention for those most in need, a strong recommendation is likely.\nThe greater the acceptability to all or most stakeholders, the greater the likelihood of a strong recommendation. The GRADE approach specifies four levels of certainty of evidence (Table 3.) The certainty of evidence is a key determinant of the strength of a recommendation, which can be either strong or conditional.\n\n# Table 3. Interpretation of the four GRADE levels of evidence\n\n# Certainty of evidence Rationale High\nWe are very confident that the true effect lies close to the estimate of effect.\nWe are moderately confident in the estimate of effect. The true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of effect, but it could be substantially different.\nOur confidence in the estimate of effect is limited. The true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of effect.\n\n# Very low\nWe have very little confidence in the estimate of effect. Any estimate of effect is very uncertain.\nGood practice statements are sometimes appropriate for use when the supporting evidence is indirect and therefore difficult to collect and summarize, but the certainty or confidence surrounding an intervention's impact is high, and when the desirable consequences of an intervention clearly outweigh the undesirable ones. Often data is not disaggregated by key population group and there is a lack of supporting evidence related to key populations, meaning that good practice statements were appropriate in the development of these guidelines. Good practice statements are, by nature, strong recommendations (56).\nFollowing the WHO guideline development process (56), the Guideline Development Group formulated recommendations according to the GRADE approach to appraise evidence. The Guideline Development Group also made good practice statements. The evidence was synthesized and incorporated into an evidence-to-decision framework to help inform the discussions at the Guideline Development Group meeting. WHO convened a virtual Guideline Development Group meeting that occurred over six days between 30 August and 8 September 2021, chaired by two members of the Guideline Development Group. All conflicts of interest were managed. The methodologist assisted by the chairs facilitated the Guideline Development Group's judgements on the potential benefits and harms of the intervention, stakeholder values and preferences, acceptability, feasibility, resource use and considerations of human rights and equity. Taken together, these judgements contributed to determining the strength and direction of the recommendation (334). All the recommendations were arrived at through consensus. Voting was not required, but the group agreed a priori that two thirds of the votes would be required for a decision. The draft guidelines were circulated for review to members of the Guideline Development Group and the External Review Group in November 2021.\n\n# Evidence and decision-making for new recommendations\n\n# Background and rationale\nBehavioural interventions are widely used in programmes which aim to reduce transmission of HIV, STI and viral hepatitis.\nThere are a range of different behavioural interventions, including those that focus on providing information and education and those that take a counselling approach, but all aim to increase health-seeking behaviours and/or reduce behaviours that increase risk of HIV, STIs and viral hepatitis, including needle and syringe sharing and unprotected sex.\nCounselling behavioural interventions can be provided by health care workers or by peers, can be a single session or multiple sessions, can be brief or long, can be provided in groups or individually, and can be online or face-to-face.\nThe 2014 and 2016 WHO Consolidated key population guidelines (3) included recommendations related to behavioural interventions that were based on low certainty of evidence and lack of standard comparators. During the scoping exercise to review which recommendations required updating and the community and expert consultation in 2019-2020 (see methods), these recommendations were identified as in need of an update. To inform the decision-making process, the evidence review focused on behavioural interventions with a counselling component, in particular whether provision of counselling behavioural interventions impacts HIV, STIs and viral hepatitis acquisition and transmission for key populations.\n\n# Evidence review\nA systematic review was commissioned by WHO to update existing recommendations, to answer the PICO question of whether counselling behavioural interventions reduces risk behaviours associated with transmission or acquisition of HIV, STIs and viral hepatitis. The primary outcomes were HBV, HCV, HIV or STI incidence and the secondary outcomes were unprotected sex (for example, condomless sex, sex without lubricant, sex without PrEP), needle and syringe sharing and mortality. A systematic review of published articles from 1 January 2010 to 1 March 2021 identified nine eligible randomized control trials (see Web Annex C). Five studies were among adult key populations and two studies were among young men who have sex with men (16-25 years old) (336) and young females (13-17 years old) released from juvenile detention (337). Together these indicated that counselling behavioural interventions probably make little to no difference on HIV (336,(338)(339)(340)(341)(342)(343), viral hepatitis (341) or STI (337)(338)(339)(340)(342)(343)(344) incidence in key populations. This was also true for unprotected sex (336)(337)(338)(339)(340)(341)(342) and needle and syringe sharing (340,341). There was moderate certainty in the lack of effect across outcomes.\nModerate certainty evidence from six randomized controlled trials (RCTs) among men who have sex with men, transgender women, people who inject drugs and sex workers in China, Kazakhstan, Kenya and the USA showed counselling behavioural interventions had probably no effect on HIV incidence in meta-analysis (combined risk ratio (RR): 0.700, 95% CI: 0.409-1.197), with no important benefit or harm (336,(338)(339)(340)(341)(342). Low certainty evidence from one RCT among sex workers who inject drugs in Mexico showed no impact on HIV/STI incidence when findings were meta-analysed across study sites (RR: 0.663; 95% CI: 0.224 to 1.960) (343).\nModerate evidence from six RCTs among people in prisons, men who have sex with men, transgender women, people who inject drugs and sex workers in China, Kazakhstan, Kenya and the USA showed probably little to no difference in STI incidence in meta-analysis (RR: 0.985; 95% CI: 0.741-1.308), with no statistically significant heterogeneity (Q=2.120, p=0.832, I-squared=0.000).\nModerate certainty evidence from one RCT among people who inject drugs in Kazakhstan showed probably little to no difference in HCV incidence when calculated as an unadjusted RR directly (RR: 0.447; 95% CI: 0.158-1.267), but there was a reduction in HCV incidence when calculated by the study authors as a rate ratio adjusting for a baseline measure of unsafe injection in the past 90 days (rate ratio: 0.31, 95% CI: 0.10-0.90).\nThere was very low certainty evidence from seven RCTs among people in prisons, men who have sex with men, people who inject drugs and sex workers in China, Kazakhstan, Kenya and the USA on the impact of counselling behavioural interventions on unprotected sex (using various measures of condomless sex; RR: 0.821, 95% CI: 0.663-1.018). This metaanalysis showed statistically significant heterogeneity (Q=22.015, p=0.001, I-squared=72.746), which was not clearly explainable by subgroup analyses or other reasons, and it is uncertain whether counselling behavioural interventions reduce unprotected sex.\nLow certainty evidence from two RCTs among people who inject drugs in the USA and Kazakhstan showed that there may be no impact on needle and syringe sharing in meta-analysis (RR: 0.719; 95% CI: 0.317-1.628), with no statistically significant heterogeneity (Q=1.135, p=0.287, I-squared=11.909).\n\n# Feasibility, cost and cost effectiveness\nA systematic review identified two studies with cost data on counselling behavioural interventions for key populations, both from the USA. Costs ranged from US$ 682 to US$ 782 for a single session and from US$ 1823 to US$ 3890 annually (345,346).\nOne cost-effectiveness analysis of an intervention among sex workers along the Mexican and USA border that included multiple components was identified (346). For a hypothetical 1000 sex workers, receiving a once-only intervention, they calculated an incremental cost of US$ 78 200, 33 HIV cases prevented and 5.7 months of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained, compared to no intervention. Additional cost per QALY gained was US$ 183. For sex workers receiving the intervention annually, they calculated an incremental cost of US$ 389 000, 29 additional HIV cases prevented and 4.5 additional months of QALY compared to the once-only intervention. The additional cost per QALY was US$ 1075.\nThere is little evidence of cost or cost effectiveness of counselling behavioural interventions in different settings or for different modalities.\n\n# Values and preferences\nTwo studies from the USA, one with men who have sex with men and one with transgender women, both focused on HIV, found that participants generally viewed specific counselling behavioural interventions favourably (347,348).\nQualitative research conducted by four global networks of key populations found that key population members (see Web Annex B for full report) value peer-led education information, counselling and outreach as it is more likely to be non-judgemental and is provided by people who understand key populations' needs. They indicated a preference for multiple, consistent interventions, rather than one-off interventions and interventions delivered through a variety of mechanisms.\nPeople who inject drugs appreciate access to information and education, but adequate access to evidence-based harm reduction approaches, such as NSPs, OAMT, and overdose management, remains a priority, in order to put health education into practice.\nThe focus of comments from all four key population networks in relation to other factors impacting access to behavioural interventions (including education and counselling) overwhelmingly related to structural issues, including: negative community and service-provider attitudes; problematic approaches and messaging; stigma and discrimination; and the need for law reform and education to change the way that key populations are perceived and treated.\n\n# Equity and acceptability\nProvision of counselling behavioural interventions may increase access if a wide range of different interventions are available with tailored content that focuses on increasing access to health services and empowering key populations. However, the key population networks research identified a lack of formal education and literacy as barriers to HIV, STI and HCV prevention education. It noted the need for more specific, ongoing, peer-based and community-led HIV, STI and HCV education. When delivered through a variety of mechanisms and formats to account for different levels of access, knowledge and literacy, and when combined with counselling and other psychosocial supports, it leads to maximum effectiveness. Key populations reported that behavioural interventions that promoted abstinence from drug use, or rehabilitation or cessation of sex work would reduce equity by creating barriers to service usage and should be avoided. Methods claiming to so-called cure homosexuality, such as conversion therapy, or other alleged methods to change gender identity or sexual orientation are harmful, are human rights violations and should never be conducted (349). Potential individual harm may occur when counsellors or counselling behavioural interventions promote abstinence from drug use, rehabilitation, cessation of sex work or advocate so-called cures for homosexuality, which can discourage key population members from accessing services. Moreover, diversion of funds to these forms of interventions can limit the availability of evidence-based interventions.\n\n# Evidence assessment and decision-making\nFollowing the WHO guideline development process, the Guideline Development Group considered the evidence and concluded that it was not possible to recommend counselling behavioural interventions to reduce HIV, viral hepatitis and STI incidence, given that there was no evidence of impact of the intervention on the outcome. However, the Guideline Development Group felt strongly that counselling and information sharing can enable informed consent and decisionmaking to initiate and continue certain interventions such as PrEP, ART, OAMT and NSPs. Counselling can enhance relationships between providers and clients and may encourage service access. The group determined to develop a good practice statement to make policy-makers and providers aware that while counselling interventions have other potential positive effects, there is moderate certainty of evidence that they probably do not reduce HIV, viral hepatitis or STI incidence.\n\n# Implementation considerations\nGiven that a systematic review did not find any effect of counselling behavioural interventions on the incidence of HIV, viral hepatitis or STI, the choice to include counselling behavioural interventions in standard and minimum packages of interventions for key populations should be made with an understanding of the potential limitations on incidence outcomes.\nIf behavioural interventions are implemented, ongoing training for peers and health care workers is needed, and stigmatizing attitudes within the health system and structural barriers to care should be addressed urgently.\nIf implemented, behavioural interventions should be developed and implemented in collaboration with key population groups. These interventions should be tailored to specific key population groups and individuals, recognizing that people are in different stages of life and have different priorities and needs. Some people may be currently unable to change their risk behaviours, or may not want to make changes, and this should be accepted without judgement. Interventions which focus on cessation of drug use, rehabilitation, ending employment as a sex worker and purported cures for homosexuality create barriers to service usage, are not recommended and should be avoided.\n\n# Research gaps\nWhile further research to measure the impact of counselling behavioural interventions on HIV, STIs and viral hepatitis is not required, future research may allow us to better understand the effect of different aspects of counselling interventions on building client and provider relationships, psychosocial improvements and mental health. Research is required across a range of settings and for each of the key population groups. For young people, peer-based counselling has been shown to be a strategy that improves ART adherence, but more research is required on its impact on PrEP adherence for HIV prevention (350).\nFor the detailed evidence profile, please see Web Annex C.\n\n# Chemsex Background and rationale\nChemsex is a growing phenomenon where individuals engage in sexual activity while taking stimulant drugs such as methamphetamine, mephedrone or gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB). Chemsex typically involves multiple participants, the use of multiple drugs (including injecting drug use), and occurs over a prolonged time, for example, in group sex or orgy parties (351)(352)(353). Chemsex is also known by other names, such as slam sex (associated with injecting drug use), party and play, or sexualized drug use. There have been increasing reports of chemsex in some communities of men who have sex with men (352), most often in high income settings in Europe and North America, though a recent qualitative scoping review of sexualized drug use and chemsex among men who have sex with men and transgender women found it to be increasingly common in Asia (354,355). The associate editor of The New England Journal of Medicine Journal Watch Infectious Diseases commented in 2018 that the \"markedly high rate\" of HIV infections among men who have sex with men participating in chemsex in a London study (356) \"identifies a high-priority (but often challenging) population for Guideline principles-Human rights > Gender equality > Equity and inclusion > Medical ethics > Universal health coverage > Evidence-based public health > Key population-led community response prevention efforts (including pre-and postexposure prophylaxis, mental health, chemical health, health promotion, and harm minimalization interventions)\" (357).\nChemsex may be associated with unprotected sex and unsafe injecting, as well as hazardous drug use, overdose, drug dependence and adverse mental health outcomes (358), with one systematic review finding inconsistent evidence of increased HIV and HCV prevalence in those engaging in slam sex (injecting drugs before or during planned sexual activity) (351).\nDuring the scoping exercise for the development of these guidelines, there was a request from key stakeholders for WHO to investigate further whether behavioural interventions can help increase uptake of services among people engaging in chemsex, reduce harms, and have an impact on HIV, viral hepatitis and STIs.\nA systematic review did not identify any articles meeting the inclusion criteria for effectiveness or cost-effectiveness. Five articles assessing values and preferences were identified in the review (359)(360)(361)(362)(363) and qualitative values and preferences research on the topic (see Web Annex C) was undertaken by four key population networks. Overall, the values and preferences research revealed a preference for:\n- specialist chemsex services (for example, specialized counselling with a single professional about both drug and sex-related issues);\n- tailored, non-judgemental, peer-led services focusing on the principles of harm reduction rather than cessation of drug use;\n- integrated sexual health and HIV, STI and viral hepatitis services; and\n- more chemsex specific information and education to be available through various modalities that include explanations of potential risks.\nQualitative values and preferences research (see Web Annex B) showed that perceptions surrounding chemsex and its relevance varied both across and within the four key population networks. Although chemsex is most widely recognized and practiced among gay, bisexual and other cis men who have sex with men, participants beyond these communities also noted that they engage in drug use to enhance or prolong sexual experiences or both. Some participants described this activity without using the term chemsex. Some sex workers reported engaging in chemsex due to pressure from clients and from financial necessity.\nThe key population groups highlighted the need to promote awareness and education surrounding chemsex, as well as to address stigma and discrimination towards those who engage in chemsex. People who inject drugs stressed the importance of expanding the understanding and changing the framing of chemsex to the concept of \"sexualized drug use\" to help reduce judgement and rather encourage and support people to engage in \"cultures of care\", including ideas such as \"hosting packs\" or \"safety kits\" that are harm-reduction focused and encourage people to \"plan to be safe\".\nWHO recommends various HIV, STI and viral hepatitis prevention options, which are relevant for those engaging in chemsex, including recommendations for condoms and lubricant for the prevention of sexual transmission of HIV and STIs, pre-exposure prophylaxis and post-exposure prophylaxis for HIV prevention, and provision of sterile needles and syringes for the prevention of HIV and viral hepatitis (3). Despite this guidance, communities and clinicians are increasingly concerned about the low uptake of these prevention interventions before, during and after engaging in chemsex, and about the ongoing risk. Interventions which aim to increase the uptake of these evidence-based prevention interventions, as well as the linkage to testing and treatment services and the integration of services, could have an impact on transmission among people engaging in chemsex. Referral to other relevant services for those reporting instances of non-consensual sex or drug use is essential.\nBased on the available preferences of the key population community, the experience gained from implementation and from the evidence-based interventions already recommended by WHO, the Guideline Development Group made a good practice statement. The group recognized the importance of highlighting this phenomenon to HIV, STI and hepatitis programmes to ensure people engaging in chemsex are linked to the appropriate services in a non-judgemental manner.\n\n# Online interventions\nBackground and rationale Increasingly, services designed for key populations are going online, conducting outreach to identify people at risk, providing information about available services, providing self-test information and tests, booking appointments for testing, and linking people diagnosed with HIV, viral hepatitis or STIs with service providers. The potential advantages of online services include: reaching a broader audience, reaching people who are geographically isolated, targeting information to specific people, improved efficiencies and convenience for clients.\nDifferent forms of interventions are implemented online, the most common of which are:\n1) Online outreach to potential key populations service users through online platforms involves reaching out to those who previously hadn't been engaged, by using systems and structures like websites and social media apps, where key populations communicate and learn information and socialize.\n2) Online case management for key populations who have tested positive and need to engage in services. Providing case management through online systems could potentially reduce loss to follow-up and provide helpful nudges (such as reminders to book an appointment or take a medication) and support for key populations. Guideline principles-Human rights > Gender equality > Equity and inclusion > Medical ethics > Universal health coverage > Evidence-based public health > Key population-led community response 3) Targeted health information uses internet sites and social networking apps to allow for messages to be targeted at user demographics and characteristics. For example, Facebook advertisements can target users of certain ages, political profiles, geographic locations, etc. Population segmentation may allow for more specific targeting of key population audiences to provide tailored information or linkage to health services.\n\n# Evidence review\nA systematic review was commissioned by WHO to answer the question of whether providing services online improves uptake of HIV, viral hepatitis, STI prevention, testing, linkage to treatment and treatment retention for key populations, compared to standard care.\nGiven the range of online interventions, the evidence review was split to consider the following separately: online outreach, online case management and targeted health information. The outcomes tested were for the following:\n- online outreach -number or proportion of previously unreached people reached, use of prevention services, PrEP adherence, PEP uptake, PEP adherence, counselling, condoms, uptake of testing services for HIV, viral hepatitis and STIs, and treatment initiation for HIV, viral hepatitis and STIs;\n- online case management -use of prevention services, uptake of testing services for HIV, viral hepatitis and STIs, treatment initiation for HIV, viral hepatitis and STIs, treatment retention or completion for HIV, viral hepatitis and STIs, viral load (for example, HIV and HCV), cure (for curable STIs, for instance HCV, syphilis and gonorrhoea) and mortality; and\n- targeted online health information -use of prevention services, uptake of testing services for HIV, viral hepatitis and STIs, treatment initiation for HIV, viral hepatitis and STIs, treatment retention/completion for HIV, viral hepatitis and STIs, viral load (for example, HIV and HCV), cure and mortality.\nTwo RCTs (364,365) and one serial cross-sectional study (366), all among men who have sex with men, were included in a review of online outreach; four RCTs (367-370) among men who have sex with men, transgender women and people in prisons, and three observational studies (371)(372)(373) among men who have sex with men, transgender women and people in prisons were included in the review of online case management; and two RCTs (374,375) and one observational study (376), all among men who have sex with men, were included in the review of targeted online health information.\n\n# Online outreach\nA stepped-wedge cluster RCT among men who have sex with men (aged 16 years and older) in China found comparable (little or no difference) in self-reported condom use between clusters who received the online HIV testing intervention compared to conventional HIV testing programmes, routinely provided by local centres of disease control and community-based organizations (RR: 1.00, 95% CI: 0.86-1.17). There was high certainty that the estimated lack of effect is close to the true effect (364). Another RCT of men who have sex with men in China found that online outreach may make little or no difference to self-reported condom use, regardless of partner type, with low certainty evidence (RR: 0.90, 95% CI: 0.39-2.06) (377).\nModerate certainty evidence from a meta-analysis of the same two RCTs showed a probable increase in HIV testing (RR: 1.39, 95% CI: 1.21-1.60) (364,377). Moderate certainty evidence from one of these RCTs showed probably no difference in syphilis testing (RR: 0.92, 95% CI: 0.70-1.21) (364).\nModerate certainty evidence from one serial cross-sectional study among men who have sex with men in the USA showed probably more previously unreached people getting reached (366). When only traditional outreach methods were used (October 2011 to March 2012) the local public health department had contact with 60 men who have sex with men. After implementing outreach via Grindr (from October 2013 to March 2014), the department made contact with 816 men who had had sex with men. There was no denominator to calculate rates, only number of contacts (which may include duplicates), and possible confounding from other factors, creating the potential risk of bias.\n\n# Online case management\nIn terms of PrEP adherence, low certainty evidence from one RCT among young men who have sex with men and transgender women (from 15 to 19 years old) in Thailand showed that there may be no difference in use of PrEP services when comparing those who used an online case-management application (provided alongside standard youth-friendly services) to no application, but with the same youth-friendly services (RR: 1.12, 95% CI: 0.78-1.59) (370).\nOne RCT among men who have sex with men in the USA showed no difference in uptake of repeat HIV testing (RR: 1.24, 95% CI: 0.78-1.95) (367), but due to the very low certainty there is limited confidence in this estimate.\nA cohort study among people in prisons living with HIV in the USA found that there may be no difference in linkage to care after release from prison, when comparing those who used an online tailored or personalized website with those who only have access to an online provider directory webpage (RR: 1.09, 95% CI: 0.92-1.29) (low certainty) (373).\nAnother cohort study among men who have sex with men and transgender women in the USA found that there may be a modest increase in the proportion who received primary HIV care in the last six months, when comparing those who completed a six-month digital HIV care navigation intervention with those who did not (RR: 1.20, 95% CI: 1.01-1.42) (low certainty) (372).\nOne RCT with moderate certainty among 90 stimulant-using men who have sex with men living with HIV in the USA found probably higher overall ART adherence in the intervention than the control arm at 4 months: 89.0% (95% CI: 83.4-94.6)\nGuideline principles-Human rights > Gender equality > Equity and inclusion > Medical ethics > Universal health coverage > Evidence-based public health > Key population-led community response intervention versus 77.2% (95% CI: 66.7-87.7) control, giving a difference in ART adherence of 11.8% (95% CI: 0.34-23.2; p= 0.04). However, two months after the intervention the improvements in adherence had probably dissipated: 85.3% (95% CI: 80.0-90.6) intervention versus 89.0% (95% CI: 83.2-94.9) control, giving a difference of -3.7% (95% CI: -11.4-4.0; p =0.34) (368).\nOne RCT with low certainty among 110 soon-to-be or recently released people in prisons living with HIV in the USA found that online outreach may make little or no difference in engagement in HIV care, measured by having seen an HIV care provider in the community at least once in the past 24 weeks (RR: 0.98, 95% CI: 0.85-1.12) (369). A cohort study with low certainty among 120 men who have sex with men and transgender women living with HIV in the USA found online case management may make little to no difference in the proportion of people in each group self-reporting currently taking ART (RR: 1.19, 95% CI: 0.97-1.45) (372).\nThe RCT with low certainty among people in prisons living with HIV in the USA found that being in an intervention group that received a computerized motivational interview and individual risk reduction plan pre-release, plus text messaging about care navigation post-release, made little or no difference to viral suppression (lab-assessed viral load < 200 copies/ ml) (RR: 0.97, 95% CI: 0.69-1.36) (369). A cohort study among men who have sex with men and transgender women living with HIV in the USA also found that using online case management makes little or no difference to viral suppression (selfreported viral load < 200 copies/ml) (RR: 1.05, 95% CI: 0.79-1.40) (372). However, another cohort study with moderate certainty among 1201 people in prisons in the USA found probable improvement in the proportion of participants who had lab-assessed virologic suppression at any of their first six care visits (RR: 1.53, 95% CI: 1.43-1.64) (371).\nNo studies measured our other outcomes of cure (for example, HCV, syphilis or gonorrhoea) or mortality.\n\n# Targeted health information\nOne RCT with low certainty among men who have sex with men in the USA found that targeted health information may make little or no difference in testing for HIV (measured by following up for HIV test result after requesting a HIV self-test kit and returning the kit) (RR: 2.19, 95% CI: 1.20-4.01), though more participants in the intervention arm requested the kit than in the control arm (375). A serial cross-sectional study among men who have sex with men in Canada with low certainty determined with GRADE methodology also found little or no difference in the number of people who ordered a syphilis test before, during or after a syphilis testing advertisement campaign (RR: 1.00, 95% CI: 0.94-1.07) (376). Another RCT was conducted among young men who have sex with men (aged from 15 to 24 years old) in the USA. Based on these results, it is uncertain whether virtual targeted health information improves testing rate for HIV or STIs (RR: 1.46, 95% CI: 0.72-2.94) because the sample size was very small (374).\nBased on evidence from one RCT among men who have sex with men in the USA, it is uncertain whether targeted health information improves uptake of prevention services (STI vaccination) because the certainty of evidence is very low (374). No studies measured other outcomes of interest: treatment for HIV, viral hepatitis and STIs, treatment retention or completion for HIV, viral hepatitis and STIs, viral load (for example, HIV and HCV), cure (for STIs, for example, syphilis and gonorrhoea) or mortality.\n\n# Feasibility, cost and cost effectiveness\nAccess to the internet and social media apps has grown exponentially in recent years, even in low-income settings. Many government and community-based programmes are already using online services for key populations, suggesting it is a feasible intervention in many settings (378).\nOnly one study was included in the cost review (379). This study among men who have sex with men in Canada found that syphilis testing campaign advertisements released over one month over four platforms had the lowest cost-per-click ratio on the hook-up platforms Grindr and Squirt, compared to more traditional social media platforms like Facebook and the Gay Ad Network. No studies measured cost effectiveness.\nIndirect evidence from FHI360 Going online budgeting guide (380) shows a wide range of costs for programmes, depending on scope of work, including, but not limited to: country or regional costs, connectivity level, programme intensity or scale, vendors, in-person trips or training needs and equipment needs.\n\n# Values and preferences\nRelated to online outreach, in Spain, men who have sex with men thought it acceptable to receive unsolicited messages about rapid HIV, syphilis or HCV testing on social media or hook-up apps (381). In Kenya, Rwanda, South Sudan, Tanzania and Uganda, almost half of respondents who self-identified as a sexual or gender minority were \"very likely\" to engage in a sexual health programme if outreach was conducted online using either text messages or emails (382). In China, men who have sex with men stated high interest and willingness to use a \"men who have sex with men-friendly physician finder function\" within gay mobile on-line applications (383).\nRelated to online case management, men who have sex with men in China expressed interest in features or functions related to sexual health that could be embedded in existing smartphone apps or developed as standalone apps (384). Men who have sex with men in the USA were strongly in favour of a smartphone app developed for online case management (385). Positive features of such apps were their ease of use (easy to navigate, fast and convenient), the ability to set reminders or alarms to take medication at a certain time each day, trackers for adherence and communication with providers, which helped users feel supported in their care process. Several studies mentioned concerns regarding ensuring confidentiality in the online environment (368,385,386 When asked about targeted online health information specifically, men who have sex with men expressed a diverse range of acceptability; however, most were comfortable interacting with health services online (376).\nQualitative research conducted by four key population networks (see Web Annex B) showed that, overall, participants across key population groups and regions supported the use of online services and platforms to augment in-person services. At the same time, many participants described challenges associated with varying levels of internet access, digital competencies, as well as the broader implications of poverty.\nIt was stressed across all key population groups that online services and platforms cannot replace in-person health services. Participants emphasized the importance of maintaining in-person, face-to-face services as a gateway to broader health and support services, as well as a means to foster personal connections and trust. Participants raised security concerns associated with leaving a digital footprint.\n\n# Equity and acceptability\nIn a qualitative, questionnaire-based study among frontline outreach workers, managers or public health volunteers who worked with men who have sex with men in Canada (387,388), it was noted that online technologies have reshaped the \"gay or queer community\", changed norms for social and sexual interactions, and that these online technologies can help reach out to hard-to-reach people. They found that, generally, online outreach allowed for more non-intrusive and anonymous communication (beneficial for clients), yet quick feedback helped them be responsive to user needs. They also outlined some barriers to online outreach, such as quality of service, collaboration between outreach service agencies and companies that own apps and websites, budgetary and staff or volunteer capacity constraints, and data security and safety. From their own experiences, service providers mentioned four ethical dilemmas as outreach moved to online platforms: 1) managing personal and professional boundaries with clients; 2) disclosing personal and identifiable information to clients; 3) maintaining client confidentiality and anonymity; and 4) security and data storage measures of online information.\nWhile noting that online platforms can be particularly impactful amongst harder-to-reach sub-populations, such as migrant sex workers or young men who have sex with men, participants in the key population networks' values and preferences research also highlighted the role that digital inequality plays in mediating access to, and uptake of, online services. Concerns, including reduced access to technology or electricity, high data costs and differing levels of digital competencies, were all cited as factors affecting the use and impact of online tools and platforms. Those with limited or controlled access to mobile devices, particularly women and adolescents, were particularly vulnerable to digital inequality (378). These issues can be exacerbated by criminalization and law enforcement actions.\n\n# Evidence assessment and decision-making\nOverall, the evidence indicates that online service delivery is at least as effective as face-to-face services in terms of reaching new people, use of HIV and STI prevention services, linkage to and retention in HIV care. While the evidence of effect was modest or small for some outcomes, and for other outcomes there was no effect found, the evidence did not show worse outcomes when employing any online service delivery method. These interventions are feasible, acceptable and may increase equity. The resource requirements will vary depending on setting and intervention, and cost effectiveness is uncertain.\nFor some people who are unable to attend face-to-face services, online services may offer the only means of receiving information, support, referral and case management. But while the use of online services is increasing, there are still limitations related to reach. Furthermore, key populations said they value online services, but felt strongly that these services should complement and not replace face-to-face services. Potential harms related to data security and confidentiality was of particular concern for key populations who may engage in criminalized and stigmatized activities and experience discrimination, arrest or harassment if confidentiality is breached. For these reasons a conditional recommendation was made in favour of online services.\n\n# Implementation considerations\nOnline services complement but do not replace face-to-face interactions and should be part of larger HIV, STI and viral hepatitis programmes for key populations. Systematic planning of the ways in which online services can complement other services and target audiences should be conducted with key populations playing a central role in their design, implementation and monitoring. Content development should be informed by appropriate and accurate health content and information aligned with recommendation practices (for example, from health programme guidelines or evidencebased normative practices) (389). Demand creation plans, service delivery packages and approaches need to be customized, based on country contexts and priorities. Online services can effectively be managed and implemented by key population peers.\nEfforts should be made to make access to the internet equitable, improve literacy and provide appropriate training where needed. Where barriers to key populations accessing online services remain, this needs to be taken into consideration when planning and implementing online programmes.\nSafety and security in online services need to be maintained by the following means: monitoring for harm, explicitly stating and using de-identified information as much as possible; maintaining data protection and storage, and training all staff in data security measures; thinking about the setting and using broad branding that does not lead to identifying certain groups of key populations; training staff in client confidentiality; verifying health worker licenses and credentials Guideline principles-Human rights > Gender equality > Equity and inclusion > Medical ethics > Universal health coverage > Evidence-based public health > Key population-led community response where applicable; using secured internet, devices and apps; and providing services only with informed consent from clients (390).\nWHO has further guidance and recommendations on general population digital health, as well as a framework for planning, developing and implementing solutions with and for young people (180,389).\n\n# Research gaps\nAvailable published research about online services for key populations is mainly among men who have sex with men in high income countries and related to HIV. Further research is needed on the accessibility, safety and effectiveness of online services for other key populations, the various experiences and preferences of different key populations in lowand middle-income settings, and their effect on outcomes related to STIs and viral hepatitis. Continuing monitoring and evaluation and publishing the implementation results will also support and help to refine future guidance.\nMore research is needed on the cost effectiveness of different types of online services by key population groups.\n\n# Peer navigators Background\nPeer navigation is rooted in the concept of patient navigation, where vulnerable patients are directly assisted to help find their way through complex health care systems to obtain timely diagnoses and treatment. Instead of formal health workers, lay staff members who are peers of the participants and therefore could promote trust among the population fill this role (391). While lay providers, including key populations, are recommended to provide HIV testing and ART distribution (190), the role of a peer navigator is different. Key population peer navigators are often employed at community-based services, primary health care settings and testing and treatment facilities that are designed to serve people from key population groups. Their role is to support key populations, after screening positive, to access confirmatory diagnosis and treatment services; to support the early stage of treatment with regular peer support, as well as to accompany key populations to appointments; and support navigation to other related health services. This is important as key population members are often under-represented in treatment programmes, and can be reticent to access treatment due to their fear of discriminatory attitudes among health care providers and other staff in health care settings, and due to their lack of experience with traditional, facility-based programmes.\nEvidence review WHO commissioned a systematic review to answer the question of whether peer navigators improve initiation and retention in HIV, viral hepatitis and STI treatment programmes for people from key populations. The outcomes tested were: time to diagnosis or linkage to care treatment initiation, treatment retention and completion, viral load, cure and mortality.\nFour studies (two RCTs and two observational studies) were included in the systematic review designed to find the effect of peer navigators on time to diagnosis, linkage to care, treatment retention or completion, and viral load or disease cure. All these studies measured HIV outcomes, and none measured STI or viral hepatitis outcomes.\nOne RCT in the USA, with high certainty evidence, found no difference in probability of HIV care visits after release from jail for people in prisons with involvement of peer navigators (RR 0.95, 95% CI: 0.81-1.12) (391), one RCT among sex workers in Tanzania found there may be improvements in linkage to care (RR 1.44, 95% CI: 1.15-1.80), but there was low certainty of this effect (128), and one observational study among transgender women in the USA found improvements in linkage to care when people were assisted by peer navigators (regression coefficient 0.38; 95% CI: 0.09-0.67) with moderate certainty that the true effect was close to this estimate (392).\nThe employment of peer navigators was found to result in modest improvements in current ART use in one RCT in Tanzania (RR 1.28, 95% CI: 1.05-1.55) (128) and one observational study in the Dominican Republic (RR 1.11, 95% CI: 1.03-1.19) (393), both with low certainty of evidence. The RCT among people in prisons found no difference in ART use with peer navigation (RR 0.97, 95% CI: 0.87-1.08) and there was moderate certainty that the true effect was close to this estimate (391).\nOne RCT showed improvements in undetectable viral load with peer navigation (RR 1.38, 95% CI: 1.03-1.85) with high certainty indicating that this estimate is very close to the true effect (391), but the other studies found no difference (128,392,393), all with moderate certainty. No studies measured the outcomes of treatment initiation, cure or mortality.\n\n# Feasibility, cost and cost effectiveness\nPeer navigators have been employed at community and facility-based services in several different settings, and it is feasible to introduce this role to new or existing programmes.\nA systematic review did not identify any research on the cost or cost effectiveness of key population peer navigators in HIV, STI or viral hepatitis programmes. Guideline Development Group members judged that as peer navigators work to support existing programmes, the cost associated with their employment may be considered to be moderate and related to salary, training, transport and tools such as mobile phones.\n\n# Values and preferences\nKey population network-led qualitative research was undertaken to assess values and preferences associated with peer navigation in all key population groups, except for people in prisons (for detailed report, please see Web Annex B). Although the term \"peer navigators\" was not universally recognized by all participants, the practice of peers assisting with health service access, information, education and referral was greatly valued by participants across all four key population groups. Participants both supported the concept of peer navigators, as well as their capacity to \"act as a bridge between two different worlds\". In some settings, peer navigators were described as one of the only available tools for reaching communities. Peer navigators were considered as facilitators throughout the testing and treatment cascade -including treatment linkage, continuity and re-engagement.\n\n# Equity and acceptability\nKey population peer navigators improve linkage to care and retention in treatment programmes for populations who may otherwise be excluded due to structural barriers, including stigma, poor literacy and poverty. In this respect, peer navigators have an important role in improving equity by assisting those with inequitable access to health care to enter testing and treatment programmes.\nA systematic review identified two studies of acceptability related to key population peers, which found overloaded health workers welcomed assistance from peer navigators and suggested appropriate tasks for them. However, concerns were expressed about clients becoming too dependent on peer navigators (that they are not able to self-manage), and there were some negative and discriminatory community reactions to support groups for men who have sex with men (394). In Mexico, staff at a community-based organization felt peer navigators could address stigma and social support. However, they discussed concerns about police interference with peer navigators, and whether it put peers and their clients at risk of harassment and arrest (395).\n\n# Assessment of evidence and decision-making\nThe benefits of using peer navigators include, as described above, the prospect of them improving linkage to care and retention in treatment. Key population members highly value services provided by their peers, and community empowerment is an evidence-based intervention (122,127). It was noted that support from peer navigators is not always desired by all key population members, particularly when people do not wish to disclose their disease status to a peer.\nPeer navigators increase equity, and peer navigation is a feasible intervention. The costs vary greatly depending on setting, and cost effectiveness is unknown.\nThe evidence included in the systematic review was only relevant to HIV programmes, although STI and viral hepatitis programmes also employ peer navigators. It was decided that there was adequate indirect evidence to make a recommendation that applies to the three disease areas. Based on the moderate certainty of evidence supporting peer navigators, the value placed on peer navigators by key populations, and the likely beneficial effect on equity, the Guideline Development Group made a conditional recommendation in favour of peer navigation.\n\n# Implementation considerations\nKey population peer navigators are increasingly employed at health services, along with key population peers who undertake different roles (including planning, mapping, management, education, adherence support, outreach, testing, distribution of medicines, overdose management, condoms and needles/syringes, etc). All peers who work within HIV, STI and viral hepatitis services need to be recognized as part of the health workforce, be fairly remunerated and receive ongoing training and development to fulfil their roles. Peer navigators can be subject to additional risks, such as arrest and violence, because they can be identified by police or others as members of the key populations; therefore, efforts should be made to protect peer navigators, in particular young key population peers, from any additional risks.\nAccording to participants in the key populations' values and preferences research, the key traits of successful peer navigators include: passion for the community and the health issue, communication, compassion, supportive listening skills, first-hand experience, trustworthiness, empathy and dedication. Participants also stressed the importance of having peer navigators with appropriate age, gender, cultural and linguistic backgrounds.\nWhile valued by key populations in general, not all key population members need or want the support of a peer navigator. Concerns about confidentiality may mean that some people prefer not to disclose their infectious disease status to a peer; therefore, they will not be comfortable using the services of a peer navigator, which highlights the importance of informed choice when implementing this intervention.\n\n# Research gaps\nWhile there is considerable research about the effectiveness of peers as treatment support staff and patient navigators, there is far less research that is specific to key populations. More studies are needed to understand the effectiveness of different approaches for various key population groups of all ages, as well as for STIs and viral hepatitis. Overall, better research on what works to improve treatment outcomes among key populations is needed.\nGuideline principles-Human rights > Gender equality > Equity and inclusion > Medical ethics > Universal health coverage > Evidence-based public health > Key population-led community response HCV recommendations: introduction Effective and affordable diagnostics and treatment are available for HCV and recommended by WHO (184,185,193,396), but a rapid increase in the availability and accessibility of HCV testing and treatment for all populations, including those at increased risk and those with HCV reinfection, will be needed to reach the elimination targets.\nHCV causes both acute and chronic infection. Acute HCV infections are usually asymptomatic, and most do not lead to a life-threatening disease. Following recently acquired HCV infection, approximately 30% (15-45%) of infected persons spontaneously clear the virus within 6 months of infection without treatment (15), with a median time to clearance of 16.5 weeks. Spontaneous clearance is more likely to occur in women, genotype 1 infection, and people with clinical evidence of acute hepatitis, but less likely to occur in people with HIV (397). The remaining 70% (55-85%) will develop chronic HCV infection. Of those with chronic HCV infection, the risk of cirrhosis ranges from 15% to 30% within 20 years (193). Importantly, individuals that clear HCV infection spontaneously or after treatment are not immune to the virus, and those with ongoing risk and exposure can become reinfected.\n\"Treatment-as-prevention\" is becoming a key part of a multifaceted public health approach to HCV elimination. Early identification of primary and recurrent HCV infections, as well as timely treatment, is vital for a treatment-as-prevention approach, in order to reduce transmission and liver disease-related morbidity and mortality (398) -especially in countries where many of the new HCV infections are among key populations.\n\n# HCV retesting after resolved HCV infection Background and rationale\nAfter HCV infection and DAA treatment or spontaneous clearance of HCV, ongoing risk behaviours, poor access to prevention interventions, and persistent structural barriers for groups such as people who inject drugs and men who have sex with men may lead to HCV reinfection, which often goes undiagnosed. The potential for HCV reinfection remains a major obstacle to achieving the HCV elimination goals. From a patient perspective, concern for HCV reinfection remains a major driver for provider and health system-level barriers to HCV treatment of persons perceived to be at high risk for reinfection after cure (399). From a population perspective, elimination is dependent on diagnosing and treating enough infected individuals, so as to reduce overall population prevalence, and thereby reduce the pool of individuals who can sustain the epidemic by transmitting infections to others. If people with high risk of transmission do not receive HCV diagnosis and treatment in a timely manner, this may present an ongoing challenge to community-wide and global HCV elimination (220).\nTo address missed diagnoses of HCV reinfection among priority groups, to offer continued care and to increase access to treatment, several national and international guidelines, including WHOʼs, suggest serial testing for hepatitis C reinfection in priority groups, but do not state a specific testing frequency (184,400). Determining this optimum frequency will assist in a treatment-as-prevention approach to reduce HCV incidence and prevalence, notably among most-affected populations.\n\n# Evidence review\nA systematic review was commissioned by WHO to answer the question of how often people with ongoing risk of HCV infection should be retested for evidence of viremia (using NAAT) for HCV RNA or HCV core antigen after treatmentinduced or spontaneous HCV clearance. The primary outcome tested was the detection rate of HCV reinfection and the secondary outcomes were testing uptake for viremia (RNA or HCV core antigen) testing; linkage to clinical assessment or treatment initiation following reinfection or both; risk behaviour and adverse events or social harm.\nNo RCTs or comparative studies were identified. Thirty-five other studies were included in the review; 33 were singlearmed observational studies and two were modelling studies. The 33 observational studies comprising 10 857 participants (key population groups included in the literature were people who inject drugs, people in prison or closed settings and men who have sex with men) at risk of HCV reinfection reported HCV reinfection incidence per 100 personyears (py), hence were included in a meta-analysis. The included studies did not report results for any of the secondary outcomes.\nThe studies had varying testing intervals; in order to answer the research question, the most meaningful comparison was between studies testing at 3-6-monthly intervals versus studies testing at greater than 6-monthly intervals.\nThe overall pooled HCV reinfection incidence estimate was 4.73 per 100 py (95% CI: 3.68, 5.78). The pooled incidence estimate among people who inject drugs was 3.94 per 100 py (95% CI: 2.83, 5.05), among men who have sex with men 7.11 per 100 py (95% CI: 4.16, 10.06) and among people in custodial settings 6.00 per 100 py (95% CI: 0.00, 12.31). Very low certainty evidence showed that among studies that reported a testing interval of 3-6 months, the pooled incidence estimate of 5.88 per 100 py (95% CI: 4.14, 7.61) was higher than studies reporting testing less frequently than every 6 months (up to every 12 months) at 3.08 per 100 py (95% CI: 1.81, 4.35). Additionally, among the people who inject drugs population, very low certainty evidence showed that pooled reinfection incidence was higher in those tested every 3-6 months at 5.39 per 100 py (95% CI: 3.47, 7.31) compared to those tested less frequently than every 6 months (up to every 12 months) at 1.84 per 100 py (95% CI: 0.64, 3.05). Given the very low certainty, confidence in these results is limited. Differences in incidence were not reported in other population groups from the studies included.\nTwo modelling studies were also identified that directly compared more and less frequent HCV testing regimes. A modelling study in India used a closed Markov model of reinfection among people who inject drugs in India. They Guideline principles-Human rights > Gender equality > Equity and inclusion > Medical ethics > Universal health coverage > Evidence-based public health > Key population-led community response assumed 6.2 million chronic HCV patients, 10% infections diagnosed/year, a reinfection rate 1.0/100 py, baseline DAA efficacy off 90%, the cost of DAAs US$ 900 for a 3-month course, and standard Indian costs for hepatitis C treatment. In a sensitivity analysis post successful treatment, the authors compared a one-off testing strategy at 1 year post-SVR compared to a regular annual testing strategy. They found that ongoing annual testing was more effective (0.4 QALY/ person treated), cost-saving (US$ 993 per person), and very cost effective, with a negative incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (401).\nA modelling study in France used a deterministic dynamic compartment model among HIV-positive men who have sex with men in France, assuming a baseline HCV prevalence of 3.6%. Their baseline scenario involved DAA treatment of all patients and 12 monthly population testing, and projected that HCV incidence would fall from 0.98 to 0.24/100py. The authors found that more frequent testing (3, 3-6 or 6-monthly) was associated with further reductions over baseline in overall HCV incidence by 2030. The reinfection incidence in these scenarios was also modelled, and demonstrated that 3, 3-6 and 6-monthly testing reduced HCV reinfection incidence by 2030 significantly more than baseline (12 monthly) testing, though there was little difference between reductions from 6-monthly (18.5%), 3-6-monthly (21.5%), and 3-monthly testing (23%) (402).\nOverall, there is very low certainty evidence that more frequent testing may identify more infections, and therefore be beneficial in contributing to preventing onward transmission if individuals are linked to treatment and care. Some of the differences between testing intervals may have been found because researchers and clinicians were more likely to frequently test patients at higher risk of reinfection.\n\n# Values and preferences\nPreferences regarding frequency of HCV testing varied greatly across the three key population groups who were asked this question in the key population-led values and preferences qualitative study (people who inject drugs, men who have sex with men, and sex workers) (see Web Annex B). Men who have sex with men pointed out a lack of protocols and the need for evidence to guide frequency of HCV testing recommendations. Meanwhile, sex workers had a wide range of preferred HCV testing frequencies -from once a week to once a year -with many participants considering 3-6 months as optimal. People who inject drugs suggested that individuals be tested every 3-months for the first year following viral clearance, and then subsequently every 6 or 12 months, depending on risk profile. Sex workers and people who inject drugs preferred that regular HCV RNA testing and retesting following cure be made available, and promoted similarly to HIV \"Test and Treat\" approaches, whereby regular monitoring is publicly and positively promoted, widespread testing is facilitated, and immediate treatment for those diagnosed is encouraged. All groups highlighted concerns associated with criminalization, stigma, and discrimination, noting that testing should always be voluntary. Overwhelmingly, key populations preferred HCV services to be community-led and available within community settings, in order to address concerns related to safety, confidentiality, stigma and discrimination, as well as criminalization.\nIncreased training and resources to support community organizations in this work will be required. People who inject drugs emphasized the importance of embedding HCV testing within a broader harm reduction approach that did not focus on abstinence, including offering pan-genotypic DAA treatment and HCV prevention for people in prisons.\nNo additional studies on related values and preferences were identified through the systematic review.\n\n# Resource-use: cost and cost effectiveness\nThe costs, both for tests confirming the presence of HCV viremia and for treatment for those identified HCV positive, vary considerably, depending on settings and countries. In particular, NAAT and HCV core antigen are relatively expensive in many lower-and middle-income settings.\nMore frequent testing could involve increased short-term costs of tests, costs of outpatient visits, including personnel and, if more reinfections are identified, the short-term costs of increased treatment. The approach may also entail opportunity costs for time and attention spent by medical personnel and administrators. Testing people more often after they have been successfully treated may also divert resources away from other testing programmes, such as those aiming to reach a larger population of people who have not had access to testing or treatment.\nIn the long-term, there may be cost savings by averting costs of advanced hepatitis disease and liver failure. There is some support from modelling evidence (401,403), with one modelling study suggesting that more frequent annual testing for reinfection of people who inject drugs post-treatment was overall cost-saving, compared to a one-time only retest (220).\nMore frequent HCV testing could potentially increase early diagnosis and treatment of HCV reinfection in priority groups, thus reducing HCV infection and improving health equity. However, increased testing frequency could also potentially increase the burden of medical interventions for patients who may have multiple comorbidities and a high treatment and investigation burden. Testing should be voluntary, and streamlining medical visits and investigations should always be considered.\n\n# Feasibility and acceptability\nNAAT and HCV core antigen testing accessibility and cost vary widely across settings. Thus, feasibility is dependent on the context, availability of resources and health system capacities. In settings with existing point-of-care solutions or Guideline principles-Human rights > Gender equality > Equity and inclusion > Medical ethics > Universal health coverage > Evidence-based public health > Key population-led community response well-developed linkage services, frequent retesting may be a feasible approach. For some people though, offers of more frequent testing based on risk may be stigmatizing and create barriers to accessing services. Also, it may be difficult to correctly assess ongoing risk, particularly in settings where key populations are criminalized and stigmatized, as people may choose not to disclose risk behaviours, and equally it will not always be possible to know about individuals' history of treatment or clearance. Moreover, increased frequency of testing, especially in the 3-6-monthly range, may be a significant time and resource burden, which may influence acceptability among providers and policy-makers.\n\n# Assessment of evidence and decision-making\nThe review found very low certainty evidence, from one-armed observational studies and limited modelling studies, in favour of more frequent retesting in people at ongoing high risk for HCV reinfection, particularly in people who inject drugs. Overall, the Guideline Development Group determined the certainty of evidence to be very low. While evidence of effect was small across the principal outcome, the Guideline Development Group highlighted that testing for presence of viremia in people with ongoing risk and previously cleared infection may be beneficial at both the individual and population level.\nThe main physical harms of more frequent blood testing for HCV are relatively minor, such as short-lived discomfort and bruising. The very rare risk of false positives should also be considered.\nConsidering the evidence of benefits for 3-6-monthly testing for reinfection; the relatively strong support from community values and preferences; the potential for expanding patient choices; the feasibility to implement; as well as potential for cost-effectiveness and improved equity, the Guideline Development Group deemed that the overall benefits outweigh the potential harms and risks. More frequent testing of people at ongoing risk can identify more people with viraemic HCV; the potential benefits of this include population-level ones, such as reduced HCV incidence and prevalence over time, due to more infections being treated and accordingly less potential for community transmission, and better individual patient outcomes related to early diagnosis. Patients may also benefit from better engagement in the health care system for other interventions, such as OAMT.\nThe Guideline Development Group recognized that testing frequency for reinfection should be contextualized and adapted to the reinfection incidence of a population. Furthermore, short-term costs and accessibility of diagnostics for presence of viremia (NAAT and HCV core antigen testing) may be a limitation to scaling-up the recommendation in some settings. Given the range consideration, the Guideline Development Group agreed to make a conditional recommendation.\n\n# Implementation considerations\nIn general, a successful response to HCV requires available, accessible, affordable and coordinated prevention, testing and treatment services, with well designed integrated service delivery and referral pathways. It is important to highlight that the frequency of retesting needs to be contextualized, and that the recommendation is meant to orientate programmes towards a potential testing frequency. Planning country-level testing frequency needs to factor in resource needs and evolving epidemiological patterns in certain populations and settings. Additionally, HCV management should include screening for HIV, STIs and voluntary partner notification for HCV testing where appropriate. Importantly, testing approaches and policies need to be developed with support from, and in exchange with, affected communities.\nOne of the major objectives of extending testing, referral and linkage to treatment to people with ongoing risk is the potential of population level benefits and a reduction of HCV transmission. Frequent testing for viremia should be offered alongside additional, evidence-based interventions to reduce HCV risk, and primary prevention services, such as harm reduction (NSPs and OAMT), which remain a priority and should be offered alongside testing for reinfection and not be de-prioritized. This new recommendation is particularly relevant for countries and settings where the reduction of HCV incidence is a major aim of the programme, and includes approaches such as micro-elimination in certain population groups.\nGiven that NAAT for occurrence of HCV RNA and HCV core antigen testing accessibility varies widely across settings and is often centralized, with the majority of tests requiring processing at central laboratories, decentralized models of care -with increased availability of point of care testing -are needed to make more frequent retesting feasible. It is important that frequent retesting is implemented in a way that does not reduce the number of people assessed for longstanding chronic HCV infection.\nIt is important to differentiate between HCV reinfection and treatment relapse in people with past DAA treatment. Evidence of HCV clearance and cure is evaluated 12 weeks after end of treatment (sustained virological response at 12 weeks post-treatment (SVR12)). SVR12 is widely considered to be equivalent to virologic cure. In the oral DAA era, rates of virologic relapse after the achievement of SVR12 are very low (399) and, when it occurs, it is usually within the first four weeks after end of treatment. Thus, a diagnosis of HCV reinfection can be made when HCV viremia is detected in persons who achieved SVR12 following completion of treatment with an effective oral DAA combination regimen, notably in persons who also have probable or definite risk factors for reinfection. In people with viremia between treatment completion and SVR12 assessment, or people for whom SVR12 is unknown, a further differentiation between relapse and reinfection may be useful and needed to orientate treatment decisions.\nMonitoring and reporting systems are critical for all approaches to viral hepatitis testing and treatment, and it is essential for programmes to utilize or adapt existing systems to monitor and report on adverse events, in order to address harm if and when it occurs.\n\n# Research gaps\nCurrent research about HCV testing and detection of viraemic infections in people with ongoing risk comes largely from high-income countries.\nTherefore, more research, ideally through comparative longitudinal studies comparing 12 monthly testing with more frequent testing or modelling, is needed to answer the question of whether more frequent testing after reinfection, followed by immediate treatment (namely, test and treat), would support a treatment-as-prevention strategy and micro-elimination of HCV with population-level benefits. There is a need for more research from LMICs. Real-world studies in different settings are needed to further establish cost-effectiveness and assess resource needs, feasibility and acceptability.\n\n# HCV treatment for recently acquired infection\nBackground and rationale WHO currently recommends HCV therapy with pan-genotypic DAAs for all persons with chronic infection over the age of 18 years and irrespective of disease's stage. DAAs can cure most persons with chronic HCV infection, and treatment duration is short (usually from 12 to 24 weeks), depending on the absence or presence of cirrhosis (193). However, DAA treatment is not currently approved by certain regulators for the treatment of recently acquired hepatitis C (404). The rationale for this policy is to avoid unnecessary treatment and costs, since around 30% of people will clear the virus without treatment. This argument may become less important in contexts in which the costs of treatment is reducing. More recently, clinical guidelines from umbrella organizations in Europe and the USA recommend the treatment of recently acquired infection, recognizing the benefits, such as reductions in loss to follow-up, avoiding chronic infection and reducing ongoing transmission (405,406).\n\n# Evidence review\nA systematic review was commissioned by WHO to determine the benefits and harm of immediate treatment of recently acquired hepatitis C in people at ongoing risk, and to update the current body of evidence informing the timing of HCV treatment. The outcome measures were hepatitis C incidence, treatment initiation, engagement in care (adherence), overtreatment, adverse events, treatment completion and SVR12.\nA post-hoc review of the search results was conducted to identify modelling studies evaluating the effectiveness of treating recently acquired HCV infection, and any studies that reported on values and preferences of stakeholders.\nNo randomized controlled trials nor comparative studies were identified in the systematic review. Twelve noncomparative studies were included in the review: three single-group prospective cohort studies (407)(408)(409) five retrospective cohort studies (410)(411)(412)(413)(414), three cohorts embedded in open label trials (415)(416)(417) and one case series study (412). Across all these studies, all outcomes were rated as providing very low certainty evidence using the GRADE approach. In general, this was due to the noncomparative nature of these study designs and the indirectness and inconsistency of the data.\nTwo retrospective cohort studies and one prospective cohort (embedded within an open label trial) reported HCV incidence among men who have sex with men living with HIV, and allowed a comparison of incidence before and after the implementation of an HCV treatment policy for recently acquired infection (411,412,416). Two of these studies reported a decrease in HCV incidence at the end of the study period; a study set in a Swiss cohort which reported a decrease in incidence from 0.53/100 py in 2014 to 0.12/100 py in 2019 (416), and a study set in the United Kingdom, which reported a decrease from 11.28/1000 py in 2016 to 4.63/1000 py in 2018 (412). One study found an increase in incidence over the study duration, from 0.73/100 py in 2015 to 1.25/100 py in 2018 (412). These studies were in large cohorts of men who have sex with men, where most of the patients were being treated in the chronic phase of infection rather than recently acquired infections. As treating chronic hepatitis C can reduce incidence on population level as well (418), it was not possible to identify the distinct effect of treating acute infection on incidence in these cohorts. Given the very low certainty, there is limited confidence in these results.\nSeven studies (three retrospective and two prospective cohorts, one open label trial and one case series), including a total of 567 participants with recently acquired hepatitis C, reported SVR12 in men who have sex with men, people living with HIV and people who inject drugs (407,409,410,413,414,417,419). The studies showed with a very low certainty evidence that people with ongoing risk treated for recently acquired HCV infection with DAA achieved consistently high rates of cure, consistent with the rates of cure seen for those treated with antivirals for chronic HCV in key risk groups. Pooled SVR12 across all risk groups was 95.9% (95% CI: 92.6-99.3%; I2 = 61.3%). With men who have sex with men, the pooled SVR12 was 96.9% (95% CI: 93.1-100%); with people living with HIV, pooled SVR12 was 97.0% (95% CI: 90.7-100%); and with people who inject drugs, pooled SVR12 was 80.4% (95% CI: 66.1-90.6%). Overall, confidence in these results is limited due to the very low certainty.\nThe one case series and one open label trial reported 100% HCV treatment completion rates in 25 men who have sex with men living with HIV (419) and among 27 people living with HIV (415). Two open label trials (415,417) reported on adherence: one found adherence of 81% amongst people living with HIV (415,417) and another found adherence ranging from 79% to 85% among people who inject drugs, men who have sex with men and people living with HIV (417).\nAdverse events were reported in four studies (409,415,417,419); one serious adverse event, an episode of rhabdomyolysis (rash and raised creatinine kinase) requiring hospitalization was described (417), while all other adverse events were considered minor. Adverse event rates ranged from 22% (21/95) to 36% (9/25). However, confidence in these results and those for adherence is limited due to the very low certainty.\nNo studies included a comparator group, so it was not possible to assess overtreatment.\n\n# Values and preferences\nQualitative research carried out by key global population networks (see Web Annex B) found that awareness of and access to HCV treatment with pan-genotypic DAAs varied greatly across key populations. Of those participants who were aware of, and felt able to comment on, HCV and HCV treatment, most reported ongoing barriers to the access and utilization of HCV services, including cost, treatment delays, stigma and discrimination, and lack of research and political will. Some sex workers had not heard of pan-genotypic DAA treatments for HCV. People who inject drugs in particular noted that in certain contexts, cessation or abstinence from drug use (and sometimes OAMT) continues to be used as a criterion for HCV treatment access. This major barrier continues to occur, despite WHO recommendations to provide HCV treatment regardless of ongoing drug use.\nPeople who inject drugs conveyed the most knowledge of pan-genotypic DAA treatment and recommended the expansion of HCV DAA treatment options and settings to maximize access and uptake, including at NSPs, OAMT clinics, drop-in centres and general health care settings. Given the high cure rates, good tolerability, low pill burden, fewer drugdrug interactions and significantly fewer side effects than the previous therapies, people who inject drugs expressed strong preferences for reducing barriers to treatment and making HCV DAA treatment as accessible as possible for people who inject drugs, including people who may have already been successfully treated and subsequently contracted a new HCV infection, as well as people with recently acquired HCV infection.\nPeople who inject drugs did not express concern about the potential for overtreatment associated with offering treatment without delay for recently acquired infection, either among people who are treatment naïve or for retreatment. Rather, they expressed the concern that it is dangerous to deny access to treatment purely on the basis that some people will spontaneously clear (without treatment) -not only for the health of the individual concerned (and potential loss to follow-up), but also due to the potential for further transmission. People who inject drugs were more concerned about the ongoing lack of access to the highly effective HCV DAA treatments in certain countries and regions than about any hypothetical risk of overtreatment. Finally, people who inject drugs also emphasized the importance of offering HCV DAA treatment (and HCV prevention, including NSPs and OAMT, as well as management overdose) for people in prisons. This is particularly important in the context of an overwhelming lack of access to sterile injecting equipment and other harm-reduction measures in most prisons globally, coupled with high levels of incarceration associated with drug-related offences.\nMost participants from other key population groups expressed limited knowledge about treatment with pan-genotypic DAAs, and the implications of treating recently acquired infection without delay or not. Nonetheless, most participants were open to this treatment, provided that they receive adequate information on its efficacy and side effects, as well as sufficient education and research to guide treatment implementation.\nNo additional studies on related values and preferences were identified through the systematic review.\n\n# Resource-use: cost and cost effectiveness\nNone of the studies identified from the systematic review and meta-analysis directly addressed resource requirements or cost-effectiveness.\nA post-hoc modelling search to identify additional cost-effectiveness models in both high-and low-income settings (420)(421)(422)(423) supported the value of treatment without delay of recently acquired HCV infection and potential populationlevel benefits. For example, in a Dutch model, earlier treatment of recent infection will cost €68.3 million over 40 years, compared to €75.1 and €98.4 million to delay treatment -either waiting for spontaneous clearance or delaying treatment until F2 stage 27 respectively. This study model also reported treatment of recent infection will prevent 7070 new infections and gain 3419 QALYs compared to F2 treatment, with resulting cost saving incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) (423). Other modelling studies from China (421) and the USA (420) also showed that treating acute HCV is cost effective and cost saving compared to deferring treatment to the chronic stage; however, there were increased costs associated with HCV treatment for recent infection in patients who were not at risk of transmitting HCV (420).\nOne modelling study demonstrated a potential reduction in HCV incidence as a result of immediate treatment (423). This study modelled treatment scenarios in a Dutch cohort of HIV-positive men who have sex with men, and found that treatment of recently acquired HCV infection lowered incidence from 1.2/100 py to 0.2/100 py, an 88% reduction in incidence compared to treatment at liver fibrosis stage F2.\nThe Guideline Development Group was of the view that overall costs in the short term for treatment and testing could be increased if people are treated for recently acquired infection with significant uncertainty due to variation in costs of testing and treatment between settings, including low-, middle-and high-income countries, changes in DAA and other medication costs over time, and the variable opportunity cost of diverting staff and attention.\nNo studies assessing equity were identified in the systematic review.\nIt can be argued that providing DAA treatment to people with recently acquired hepatitis C expands choice (namely, by providing a second option to deferral of treatment until chronic infection) for key populations, and may reduce loss to follow-up, thereby increasing the number of people accessing treatment. In settings where access to DAAs is limited, implementing treatment for people with recently acquired infection without increasing overall DAA supply may have a negative health equity impact if DAAs are re-allocated from people with chronic hepatitis C, who are beyond the point of spontaneous clearance, and require treatment to prevent future morbidity and mortality. People with recently acquired hepatitis, on the other hand, may not necessarily require treatment, due to the remaining possibility of spontaneous clearance. Increased availability of affordable HCV treatment is needed to achieve elimination goals and ensure equity.\n\n# Feasibility and acceptability\nNone of the identified studies from the systematic review and meta-analysis directly addressed feasibility or acceptability.\nOverall, it could be argued that feasibility will depend greatly on context and health systems' capacities. Offering treatment without delay to people independent of chronicity may simplify HCV treatment and care algorithms and increase patient choice, and thus be a feasible option in many different settings and countries. In settings with existing decentralized services for HCV testing and treatment, or well-developed linkages, treatment without delay may be particularly feasible. Furthermore, improving awareness of HCV and DAA among key population members will be required.\nIt is possible that the risk of adverse events from HCV treatment -however mild -may be unacceptable to people with recently acquired hepatitis C if the possibility of achieving spontaneous clearance has not yet been exhausted. Allowing individuals to make an informed choice between immediate and deferred treatment is therefore important. Similarly, it is unclear whether routinely prescribing a treatment to individuals with recently acquired hepatitis C without a period of observation for spontaneous clearance is acceptable to clinicians.\nThe Guideline Development Group judged that the intervention would probably be acceptable to most key stakeholders. There was some uncertainty around whether routinely prescribing a treatment to individuals with recently acquired hepatitis C without a period of observation for spontaneous clearance would be acceptable to clinicians.\n\n# Assessment of evidence and decision-making\nThe Guideline Development Group agreed that the issue of treating recently acquired HCV infection in persons with continuous risk exposure was a priority for public health and HCV elimination, and that the benefits clearly outweighed the harm. Benefits overall were judged to be large or moderate, and the related harm was trivial or small. Overall, the Guideline Development Group determined the certainty of evidence to be very low.\nWhile evidence of effect was small across all outcomes, the Guideline Development Group highlighted that HCV treatment without delay for recently acquired HCV infection for those with ongoing risk can be beneficial, at both the individual and population level. Improved identification and treatment of recently acquired HCV may bring the benefit to the individual of being cured as soon as possible after diagnosis, rather than having to wait to access treatment and the associated risk of loss-to-follow-up, and thus would increase patient choices. The Guideline Development Group acknowledged the potential broader population-level benefit from curing an individual as soon as possible; namely, reducing the period of time during which they are infectious, and thereby reducing HCV incidence in certain population networks.\nThe group acknowledged that, following infection with hepatitis C, approximately one third of individuals will spontaneously clear the virus (that is, cure without any medical intervention). Therefore, treating all people with recently acquired hepatitis C immediately means that people who would have otherwise cleared their infection spontaneously are unnecessarily exposed to treatment. However, adverse events are very rare, and there was a clear preference for having treatment as an option.\nConsidering the evidence regarding good treatment outcomes of recently acquired infection in people with ongoing risk, the potential for reduction of HCV transmission in certain communities and populations, the strong support from community values and preferences, the potential for expanding patient choices and its feasibility to implement, as well as potential for cost-effectiveness and improved equity, the Guideline Development Group deemed that the overall benefits largely outweigh the potential harm and risk. The recommendation was thought to provide a potential for reduced stigma and simpler clinical care. Given all these elements, the group made a strong recommendation that applies to all populations with ongoing risk in all settings.\n\n# Implementation considerations\nExtending HCV treatment to people with ongoing risk and recently acquired infection, requires several areas to be considered in order to facilitate implementation in countries. The latest WHO HCV treatment and care guidelines should be consulted for further details on the clinical management of HCV (424).\nFirstly, treatment without delay, independent of chronicity, is an additional indication for HCV treatment, and national treatment guidelines need to be amended. Furthermore, insurance policies for the treatment for recently acquired infection would ideally be streamlined with those for chronic HCV infection; this needs policy change and dialogue with funders and health insurance schemes in order to achieve this policy harmonization. Amendments to treatment guidelines or treatment policies need to provide a case definition for recently acquired infections, describe how a distinction can be made for treatment failure among people with a history of past HCV treatment, and how respective Guideline principles-Human rights > Gender equality > Equity and inclusion > Medical ethics > Universal health coverage > Evidence-based public health > Key population-led community response treatment strategies may differ. Moreover, it is important to identify and define certain subpopulations in which a treatment delay should be strongly considered, such as pregnant women. Furthermore, people at ongoing risk need to be offered adequate and frequent testing in order to be able to describe and discover recent HCV infection.\nSecondly, patients need to be informed about the benefit and harm associated with both immediate and deferred treatment. Individuals with recently acquired infection must have the option to make an informed choice about starting treatment immediately or delaying treatment initiation. Key populations expressed preference for decentralization, with an expansion of treatment settings and simplified test and treat approaches.\nFinally, one of the major objectives of extending treatment to people with recent infection and ongoing risk is the potential of population-level benefits and a reduction of HCV transmission. For the greatest impact, treatment for recently acquired infection should be offered alongside additional, evidence-based interventions to reduce HCV risk and primary prevention services, as outlined in these guidelines.\nThe Guideline Development Group discussed the importance and relevance of, in the future, expanding this new recommendation to promote treatment without delay in all populations, and not only for those people at ongoing risk.\n\n# Research gaps\nCurrent research about HCV treatment without delay for key populations is mainly among men who have sex with men in high income countries. Further research is needed to describe the impact and added value of extending treatment without delay to recent HCV infection on individual and population level in different settings and populations.\nReal world cost-effectiveness and feasibility studies would be valuable to further strengthen the case for treatment of recently acquired HCV infection. Implementation science that evaluates feasibility and acceptability of this approach in different key populations would be beneficial.\nThe potential for truncated courses of DAAs administered during recently acquired HCV may prove to be a benefit to early treatment of HCV and warrants further research.\nPooling samples from different anatomical sites for the diagnosis of Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis Recommendation Where biologic samples are collected from multiple anatomical sites in the same individual, they may be pooled for molecular testing of Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis infections (conditional recommendation, moderate certainty of evidence for men who have sex with men, and low certainty of evidence for other key populations).\n- Collection of biological samples from all anatomical sites should always be voluntary.\n- WHO recommends NAAT for the detection of N. gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis.\n- WHO recommends self-collection of samples for NAAT for the detection of N. gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis.\n- Community values and preferences did not include cisgender women, transgender men and non-binary people assigned female at birth, to inform this recommendation.\nKey populations are disproportionately affected by STIs. Several STIs are highly transmissible and often asymptomatic. Syndromic management of STIs misses asymptomatic cases and results in overtreatment. Furthermore, overtreatment contributes to antimicrobial resistance (425). For example, inappropriate management of N. gonorrhoeae may accelerate the emergence of multidrug-resistant N. gonorrhoeae and increase onward transmission (426). This underscores the need for aetiological diagnosis to optimise STI case management, particularly among key populations who practice oral and anal sex.\nN. gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis can infect different anatomical sites. Thus, aetiological screening of all appropriate anatomical sites (oropharynx, urethra, endocervix and anorectum) is needed when an individual engages in anal or oral sex or both. Considering the high proportion of asymptomatic infections caused by these pathogens, a significant proportion of cases would be missed if only genital screening was undertaken (427). Studies have demonstrated that up to one third of gonorrhoea cases would be missed if only urethral or urine samples were tested in men who have sex with men (428,429).\nWhilst separate testing from different anatomical sites is preferable, there is an additional cost associated with testing samples from each site. This is especially relevant in LMICs where the cost of NAAT recommended for the diagnosis of these infections is a major barrier (430).\n\n# Evidence review\nA systematic review was commissioned by WHO to answer the question of whether pooling of samples from different anatomical sites should be used for STI laboratory screening of gonorrhoea and chlamydial infection, compared to individual samples from three anatomical sites (urethra, anorectum and oropharynx). The outcome of interest was diagnostic accuracy. Guideline principles-Human rights > Gender equality > Equity and inclusion > Medical ethics > Universal health coverage > Evidence-based public health > Key population-led community response For chlamydial infection, a meta-analysis of sensitivity and specificity included 15 estimates from 14 studies of 5891 patients (431). For multisite pooled testing for chlamydia infection, the review found the combined sensitivity 28 was probably 93.1% (95% CI: 90.5-95.0, I(2)=43.3), and combined specificity 29 was probably 99.4% (95% CI:99.0-99.6, I(2)=52.9) (moderate certainty evidence). This means, if 1000 people are tested with a background prevalence of 10% for chlamydial infection (100 cases), switching from single-site testing to pooled testing will probably result in seven missed cases (out of 100 true cases), and five people being overtreated.\nFor gonorrhoea, 14 estimates from 13 studies were used for the meta-analysis with data from 6565 patients. For multisite pooled testing for gonorrhoea, the review found the combined sensitivity using NAAT was probably 94.1% (95% CI: 90.9-96.3, I(2)=68.4) (low certainty evidence), and pooled specificity may be 99.6% (99.1-99.8, I(2)=83.6) (moderate certainty evidence). This means, if 1000 people are tested with a background prevalence of 10% for gonorrhoea, switching from single-site testing to pooled testing will probably result in six missed cases (out of 100 true cases), and four people being overtreated.\nMeta-regression analyses did not show any significant impact on the accuracy of multisite pooled testing according to study population (men who have sex with men compared to men who have sex with women), study population size (100), country-income level, sample collection (self-collected versus clinician-collected) or publication year (before 2020 versus 2020 or after).\nFour studies among men who have sex with men provided information specifically on the sensitivity of detecting oropharyngeal infections using pooled testing versus the standard of care (namely, testing individual samples from the three anatomic sites for chlamydia and gonorrhoea) (432)(433)(434)(435). All oropharyngeal infections with C. trachomatis were detected using pooled testing in three out of four studies (10)(11)(12). In the remaining study, pooling samples resulted in one case missed out of six with oropharyngeal infection (433). On the other hand, overall, the sensitivities of oropharyngeal gonorrhoea testing using individual samples were found to be lower for identifying infection across all studies (432)(433)(434)(435). The authors hypothesised that the reduced sensitivities were attributed to the lower bacterial load in the pharynx compared to other anatomic sites. Furthermore, two studies highlighted that most N. gonorrhoeae infections occurred in the pharynx, several of which would have been missed if this anatomical site was not sampled (9).\nIt is also important to note that the studies included in the systematic review were predominantly conducted in high-income countries (82.6%, 14/17) and men who have sex with men were the most frequently studied population (70.6%, 12/17).\nIn summary, although different methods of pooling were used across the studies (related to flow and timing, different order of pooling sample, different volumes of urine used, the consistently high accuracy of multisite pooled testing, despite diverse methodologies of pooling, suggest that accuracy was not significantly impacted by the method of pooling. Overall, the certainty of evidence was downgraded to moderate, mainly because of potential risk of bias in most studies due to patient selection bias, with moderate heterogeneity observed for studies contributing to gonorrhoea sensitivity results.\n\n# Feasibility, cost and cost-effectiveness\nNo study included in the systematic review reported the feasibility to combine samples for multisite pooled testing. However, the Guideline Development Group noted that while pooling samples was generally feasible, this could vary depending on setting due to different laboratory structures, flow and technical capacities, among other things. The systematic review identified three studies that estimated the cost savings of pooling samples from different anatomical sites for chlamydia or gonorrhoea testing. One study of 1064 men who have sex with men attending sexual health clinics and hospital sites between October 2012 and August 2013 in the United Kingdom suggested that pooled testing offers cost savings of up to two thirds of the costs of the assays alone, as well as savings in consumables, processing time and clinical pathway efficacy (433). A prospective study between February 2018 and July 2019 of 501 female sex workers in Belgium demonstrated a 35% decrease in reagent costs and lab technician time when using pooled testing (calculated using the obtained prevalence of 6.5% and 3.5% for chlamydia and gonorrhoea, respectively) (436). Finally, one study assessed the efficacy of pooled testing among 497 men who have sex with men in four West African countries, and demonstrated a 56% decrease in costs, in which unpooling of triple-site pooling was only undertaken when the pooled sample result was invalid (437).\nOne cost-effectiveness study was identified. For men who have sex with men attending sexual health clinics in the United Kingdom, researchers reported that using a willingness to pay threshold of £60 per person tested, pooled testing had a 100% probability of being cost-effective. Compared with individually analysed samples, pooled testing saved £13.37 to £18.22 per individual tested, depending on the symptom status or population group (namely, men who have sex with men and women from the general population) (438).\n\n# Values and preferences\nQualitative research by key population networks of gay and other men who have sex with men and sex workers of all genders on values and preferences associated with pooled sampling for STI testing was conducted with men who have sex with men, cisgender males and transgender women sex workers, but not among people who inject drugs, cisgender Guideline principles-Human rights > Gender equality > Equity and inclusion > Medical ethics > Universal health coverage > Evidence-based public health > Key population-led community response women who work as sex workers or others assigned female at birth. Most participants in the research indicated that they were not familiar with this method for chlamydia and gonorrhoea screening. Nonetheless, most participants stated that they were willing to have samples taken from three anatomical sites and pooled, particularly if this method would yield the most accurate results. There was uncertainty across all regions among men who have sex with men about how accurate these tests using pooled samples are. This would indicate that more education must be done at the clinical and community level about the efficacy of these testing choices.\nMen who have sex with men noted that due to the stigma surrounding anal sampling, the practice of simultaneously collecting and pooling samples from anorectum, oropharyngeal and urethral swabs could offer a less stigmatizing way to test for STIs. Pooling samples would also reduce the need for health care providers to ask clients what kind of sex they engage in, thus decreasing judgement and potential risky disclosure on sexual practices. Caution should be taken in extending the practice of not asking clients what kind of sex they engage in to other key populations, as the other populations were not consulted. For a detailed report, please see Web Annex B.\nAdditionally, two studies identified through the systematic review indicated that individuals (men who have sex with men and cisgender women) found self-sampling for chlamydia or gonorrhoea testing to be acceptable and easy to perform (433,439).\n\n# Equity and acceptability\nSeven studies discussed the health equity impact pooling could bring by increasing testing coverage (434)(435)(436)(437)(440)(441)(442), especially for asymptomatic individuals who would not otherwise have been tested in LMICs (437). A study also suggested that pooled testing should be incorporated in HIV PrEP programmes in resource-limited countries (17). In addition, cost savings via pooled testing would allow more people with infection to be detected and treated, or for those at higher risk of infection to be tested more frequently with a similar budget.\nA web-based survey of clinic heads in the United Kingdom from 2018 reported that 84% (41/49) of sexual health clinicians in England considered the most significant benefit of pooling was cost savings, but were concerned about barriers such as lack of national guidance, loss of infection site information and a perceived reduction in sensitivity or specificity (441). In addition, most (77%, 40/52) clinicians requested more validation studies on diagnostic accuracy, 75% (39/52) wanted clinical guidelines of pooling and 48% (25/52) of clinicians requested further cost analysis (441).\n\n# Assessment of evidence and decision-making\nThe Guideline Development Group discussed the benefits of pooling samples from three anatomical sites for gonorrhoea and chlamydia testing, based on the evidence review and the values and preferences of the communities.\nConsidering the high sensitivity and specificity of pooling samples for molecular testing for both chlamydia and gonorrhoea, the benefits of pooling samples include:\n1) increased detection of extra-genital infections by using the same test for multiple anatomical sites, and an increase of test coverage, especially testing more asymptomatic individuals at higher risk of STIs, due to potentially significant cost savings;\n2) potential decrease in the risk of HIV acquisition if more extra-genital infections and individuals are correctly diagnosed and treated; and\n3) decreased workload for laboratories and other health services, especially when implementing testing at or near the point of care.\nFurthermore, self-sampling, which is highly acceptable, does not affect the accuracy of multisite pooled sampling.\nThe values and preferences research among the key population communities (see Web Annex B) was limited to men who have sex with men, cisgender male sex workers and transgender women sex workers, and did not include cisgender women who work as sex workers, transgender men and other people assigned female at birth. For this reason, the Guideline Development Group felt that there was a possibly important uncertainty and variability in the assessment of key populationsʼ values and preferences for pooled-site sampling. The Guideline Development Group member from NSWP in particular expressed their concern about the omission of cisgender women and transgender men in the values and preferences survey and requested that this research be undertaken as a matter of priority.\nPotential harms discussed by the Guideline Development Group were that, compared to a gold standard, single-site test, there would be small numbers of missed cases (five for chlamydia, six for gonorrhoea) and overtreated cases (five for chlamydia, four for gonorrhoea) if pooling samples from multiple anatomical sites in a population of 1000 people with a 10% background prevalence. Furthermore, there is uncertainty about the sensitivity of pooled-site sampling to detect oropharyngeal gonorrhoea, and without retesting, it is not possible to know exactly which sites are infected. However, this small loss in sensitivity was balanced by the opportunity to test the multiple anatomical sites when using pooled testing in settings where oropharyngeal sampling is not routinely performed because of cost.\nThe potential benefits of pooling samples from multiple anatomical sites to diagnose these two pathogens outweighed the harms of slightly lower accuracy. Thus, the Guideline Development Group decided to make a recommendation in favour of the intervention. There was overall moderate certainty evidence of sensitivity and specificity of pooled samples for both chlamydia and gonorrhoea. However, the limited data from LMICs and from other key populations, besides Guideline principles-Human rights > Gender equality > Equity and inclusion > Medical ethics > Universal health coverage > Evidence-based public health > Key population-led community response men who have sex with men, led the Guideline Development Group to downgrade the certainty for other populations to low. Based on the above considerations the Guideline Development Group made a conditional recommendation with moderate certainty of evidence for men who have sex with men and low certainty of evidence for other key populations.\n\n# Implementation considerations\nMultisite pooled-sample testing is highly sensitive and specific with potential associated cost-saving benefits and creates an opportunity to increase the detection of extra-genital infection and screening coverage, particularly in LMICs using NAAT.\nCountries should consider conducting national lab validation methods for the use of pooled samples to diagnose chlamydial and gonococcal infections, and to include pooled sampling into national quality assurance and control protocols. The question of who would pool the samples has to be considered; for example, would the task be completed by self-sampling, health providers or lab technicians. Each approach will require adapting national protocols, training providers when point-of-care or near point-of-care tests are used and, when applicable, lab procedures and logistics, including the reorganization of sample flow, testing platform, and adjusting necessary supplies for sample collection.\nPooling samples from multiple anatomical sites can also have an impact on countries with national guidelines recommending different dosages and treatment schedules, depending on the anatomical site. In this case, there may be a need to retest samples from the different sites separately to prescribe the recommended treatment. If new samples need to be collected from positive individuals, it must be balanced against the risk of treatment delays and lost-to-follow-up patients. These concerns will not apply to countries following current WHO recommendations for the treatment of genital or anorectal chlamydial infection, for which doxycycline can be used in the same dosage in both cases as first line, or for gonorrhoea using dual therapy as the first line, when either no or insufficient data are available from local gonococcal antimicrobial resistance (443,444). However, due to growing gonococcal antimicrobial resistance to ceftriaxone and azithromycin, WHO is updating the treatment guidelines for N. gonorrhoea infections, which may have implications for the treatment of infection at different anatomical sites.\n\n# Research gaps\nBased on the review of the evidence, a critical knowledge gap to be addressed is the accuracy of testing for N. gonorrhoeae -comparing oropharyngeal samples alone versus pooled with samples from other anatomical sites. Regarding the performance of pooled-sample testing, further studies are needed to define the optimal dilution of pooled samples for best accuracy, including optimal urine volume (when urine samples are used instead of swabs), and to understand the potential effects of the order of samples for pooling.\nAdditionally, there is a need to study the cost-effectiveness of pooling samples against different background prevalence of infections, and to model the optimal cut-off point for the utility of single-site pooled testing to maximise costeffectiveness in different settings.\nIt is also critical to better understand the values and preferences of key population members who are cisgender women, transgender men and non-binary people assigned female at birth, as they were not included in the values and preferences research conducted for the development of these guidelines. Implementation research is important to support the adoption of multisite testing, including exploring the perception of those men who have sex with men interviewed as part of the values and preferences study, regarding the possibility of having biological samples collected from the three anatomical sites as a standard of care; namely, not requiring the disclosure of sexual practices to providers, has the potential to reduce perceived stigma and discrimination, and to increase access to care by men who have sex with men.\nFinally, for countries using different treatment regimens for gonococcal and chlamydial infections or both based on anatomical site, it would be relevant to better understand the benefits versus harms of opening sample pools (retesting samples) after a positive result, considering potential treatment delays and lost-to-follow-up in different settings. Conducting an economic evaluation of retesting multiple sites in different contexts should also be considered.", "source": "who", "question": "According to authoritative WHO guidelines, discuss how national programmes should determine and implement the frequency of HCV viremia retesting (NAAT or HCV core antigen) after treatment‑induced or spontaneous HCV clearance in people with ongoing risk, including a concise summary of the supporting evidence, the anticipated individual and population benefits and harms, cost and feasibility considerations, and how testing frequency should be contextualized for different key populations and health‑system settings."}

{"guideline_text": "JUPITER Trial Demonstrates Effectiveness of Statin Therapy in Reducing Cardiovascular Events among Healthy Patients\nNovember 10, 2008 By Scott P. Williams \nNew Orleans, LA: The results of the JUPITER trial suggest that rosuvastatin effectively reduces the occurrence of myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, and cardiovascular death among patients who have low LDL levels but elevated high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) levels.  The results were released at the American Heart Association’s 2008 Scientific Sessions.\nAccording to the current prevention guidelines, patients with average or low LDL levels are not considered optimal candidates for statin therapy, but nearly half of MIs and strokes occur in this patient population. Previous work has also established that high hsCRP levels are associated with an increased risk of vascular events, and that statin therapy can help reduce hsCRP levels.\nThe JUPITER trial was an international randomized double blind placebo controlled examination of the efficacy of rosuvastatin for the prevention of cardiovascular events among patients with low LDL levels (LDL < 130 mg/dL) and elevated hsCRP levels (hsCRP ≥ 2 mg/L).  The study enrolled 17,802 men and women who had no prior history of cardiovascular disease or diabetes mellitus.  Following a 4-week run-in patients were assigned to either 20 mg daily dose of rosuvastatin or a placebo and were monitored supposed to monitored for 3.5 years, but the trial was ended after 1.9 years due to overwhelmingly positive results.  Baseline characteristics and safety outcomes were similar in sets of patients.\nPatients who received rosuvastatin demonstrated a 44% reduction in the occurrence of the trial’s primary endpoint of MI, stroke, unstable angina/revascularization, and cardiovascular death (HR 0.56; 95% CI, 0.46-0.69; P<0.00001) during the nearly two year period of the study. When viewed individually, the occurrence of MI and stroke were both significantly lower among patients who received rosuvastatin. There were 31 cases of MI among patients who received rosuvastatin versus 68 in patients who received a placebo (HR 0.46; 95% CI, 0.30-0.70; P<0.0002). Similarly, there were 33 incidences of stroke among rosuvastatin patients versus 64 among those who received a placebo (HR 0.52; 95% CI, 0.34-0.79; p<0.002). All cause mortality, a secondary endpoint of the trial, was 20% lower among patients who received the daily statin therapy (HR 0.80; 95% CI, 0.67-0.97; P=0.02). The study’s authors noted that these benefits of rosuvastatin were consistent among all of the sub-group analyses performed, including age, sex, and ethnicity.\nThe authors concluded that a new evidence based guideline for the use of preventative statin therapy should call for the treatment of men and women over the age of fifty if they: are diabetic; have LDLC > 160 mg/dL; have hsCRP > 2 mg/L.\nHowever, because the trial is evaluating an agent that dramatically lowers LDLC as well as hsCRP, it can't directly answer whether CRP reduction alone leads to reduced cardiovascular risk. This hypothesis will require testing of agents with targeted vascular anti-inflammatory effects that lack proven beneficial effects (ie. a LDLC reduction).\nThe JUPITER trial was a physician initiated trial, which was funded by AstraZeneca. Dr Ridker is a co-inventor on patents held by the Brigham and Women’s Hospital that relate to the use of inflammatory biomarkers in cardiovascular disease that have been licensed to Dade-Behring and AstraZeneca.\nDownload the JUPITER slides here\nAccess Dr Ridker's multimedia presentation here", "source": "wikidoc", "question": "According to authoritative guidelines, discuss how the JUPITER trial results should influence clinicians’ decisions about initiating preventive rosuvastatin therapy — including which patient characteristics from the trial should guide selection (age, LDL, hsCRP, diabetes and prior CVD status), the magnitude and clinical significance of observed benefits and harms, the trial’s limitations that affect generalisability, and how these findings should (or should not) prompt changes to existing prevention guidelines."}
{"guideline_text": "Insertion of customised titanium implants, with soft tissue cover, for orofacial reconstruction\n\n# Guidance\nThis document and Insertion of customised titanium implants, without soft tissue cover, for orofacial reconstruction (interventional procedure guidance 457) replace previous guidance on exposed customised titanium implants for orofacial reconstruction (interventional procedure guidance 28).\nCurrent evidence on the efficacy and safety of customised titanium implant insertion for orofacial reconstruction, including reconstruction of the orbital floor, where implants are covered or expected to become substantially covered with soft tissue, is adequate for this procedure to be used with normal arrangements for clinical governance, consent and audit or research. This guidance does not cover complex orofacial reconstruction involving multiple bony and cartilaginous structures, with little or no soft tissue cover.# The procedure\n\n# Indications and current treatments\nOrofacial reconstruction is most frequently needed after severe orofacial trauma or removal of orofacial tumours, but may also be used to treat congenital facial abnormalities. Various materials are used including autologous grafts; tissue-engineered bone; alloplastic materials such as silicone, titanium or hydroxyapatite; and composites (for example, titanium mesh embedded in porous polyethylene). In some sites in the orofacial skeleton (such as the orbital floor) such implants are initially exposed, but there is good radiological and clinical evidence that a protective soft tissue covering forms over them.\nThe traditional method of forming titanium implants for facial reconstruction is to bend and cut titanium mesh during the operation. A number of insertion attempts may be necessary before correct implant shape is achieved. In this procedure, computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing (CAD‑CAM) techniques are used to create a customised implant before the operation to insert the implant. The aim is to improve both functional and cosmetic outcomes.\n\n# Outline of the procedure\nThe first step in making a customised titanium implant for orofacial reconstruction is to create a precise anatomical model of the patient's skull or a 3-dimensional simulated computer image, using computed tomography or cone-beam computed tomography scans and CAD‑CAM techniques. The implant is then shaped using the contours of this model.\nThe implantation procedure is performed with the patient under general anaesthesia. The sterilised titanium implant is fixed to adjacent bone using titanium screws. Precise details of the operation will depend on where the implant is to be used and the extent of surrounding damage. In most cases the implant is covered, either using existing soft tissue from the area or by transplant of a tissue flap from a donor site. However, implants abutting the paranasal sinuses are left partially exposed in the expectation of soft tissue cover developing as a result of fibrosis and epithelialisation.\nSections 2.3 and 2.4 describe efficacy and safety outcomes from the published literature that the Committee considered as part of the evidence about this procedure. For more detailed information on the evidence, see the overview.\n\n# Efficacy\nA non-randomised comparative study of 64 patients with facial asymmetry who had orbitozygomatic reconstruction for enophthalmos (posterior displacement of the eyeball) reported good globe projection in 76% (19/25) of patients treated by customised implants compared with 59% (23/39) of patients treated by traditional implants at 1-month follow-up; 8% (2/25) of patients treated by customised implants needed an ocular prosthesis compared with 21% (8/39) of patients treated by traditional implants (p values not reported). A case series of 29 patients reported that enophthalmos was fully corrected in 69% (20/29) of patients and improved in 31% (9/29) of patients, at a mean follow-up of 14 months. However, it was noted that overcorrection of enophthalmos occurred in 10% (3/29) of patients.\nA non-randomised comparative study of 24 patients reported significantly better reduction of binocular single vision loss area (p=0.015), correction of primary globe position in vertical visual disparity (p=0.012) and improvement in upgaze disparity (p=0.003) for patients treated by customised implants compared with patients treated by traditional implants at 12-month follow-up. The case series of 29 patients reported that diplopia had resolved in 21% (5/24) of patients, improved in 37% (9/24) of patients and not changed in 42% (10/24) of patients, at a mean follow-up of 14 months.\nThe case series of 29 patients reported that restricted ocular motility resolved in 15% (4/26) of patients, improved in 35% (9/26) of patients and did not change in 50% (13/26) of patients, at a mean follow-up of 14 months.\nThe non-randomised comparative study of 64 patients with facial asymmetry who had orbitozygomatic reconstruction reported perfect reduction of the zygoma in 92% (23/25) of patients treated by customised implants (including 11 procedures that used computer-assisted navigation) compared with 74% (29/39) of patients treated by traditional implants (p value not reported).\nIn a case series of 22 patients with orbital defects, 1 out of 17 patients with preoperative diplopia needed ocular motor surgery after the initial procedure (follow-up 24 months).\nThe Specialist Advisers listed key efficacy outcomes as long-term function and durability of the implant, and return to normal daily activities.\n\n# Safety\nTitanium mesh became unintentionally exposed in 2 patients in a case series of 20 patients who had undergone reconstruction of high maxillary defects. In 1 patient, the mesh became exposed in the oral cavity at 36 months; in the other patient, the mesh became exposed through the infraorbital skin at 4 months. Both patients had further surgery. A palpable plate rim was reported in 1 patient in the case series of 22 orbital reconstructions. The patient developed pain and irritation at the inferior orbital margin, where she was able to feel the plate flange and screw (timing not reported). The flange was trimmed and the screw removed in a further operation.\nInfection in the region of the implant was reported in 1 patient in the case series of 29 patients who had undergone extensive orbital reconstruction. Maxillary sinusitis was reported in 1 patient in the non-randomised comparative study of 64 patients (treatment group not reported). This resolved after debridement and drainage.\nOronasal fistulae were reported in 2 patients in the case series of 20 patients who had undergone maxillary reconstruction. The fistulae were detected at the edge of palatal skin paddles 1 year after surgery and were sealed with removable partial dentures.\nVisual deterioration occurred in 1 patient in the case series of 22 patients. The patient developed a sudden-onset subjective decrease in visual acuity, with no perception of light after 8 hours. This resolved within a week of the implant being removed. Transient loss of visual acuity occurred in 1 patient in a case series of 15 patients who had undergone orbital reconstruction, which was attributed to the mesh plate encroaching on the optic nerve. Reoperation led to complete recovery.\nIntraconal soft tissue scarring, limited ocular motility and persistent diplopia were reported in 1 patient from the case series of 15 patients with orbital defects. Diplopia improved after revisional surgery.\nOculomotor nerve palsy occurred in 1 patient in the non-randomised comparative study of 64 patients with a follow-up period of 1 month (treatment group not reported); surgery was carried out to correct the resulting strabismus.\nThe Specialist Advisers listed additional theoretical adverse events as bone resorption, loosening of the implant, and loss of the integrated elements of the prosthesis.# Further information\nFor related NICE guidance see the NICE website.\n\n# Information for patients\nNICE has produced information on this procedure for patients and carers (Information for the public).

There is a Black Box Warning for this drug as shown here.  Common adverse reactions include fever, nausea, diarrhea, anemia, abdominal pain,hypokalemia,  coughing, dyspnea,confusion, anxiety.\n\n# Adult Indications and Dosage\n\n## FDA-Labeled Indications and Dosage (Adult)\n\n# Indications\nCMV Retinitis\n- Foscarnet sodium is indicated for the treatment of CMV retinitis in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Combination therapy with FOSCARNET SODIUM and ganciclovir is indicated for patients who have relapsed after monotherapy with either drug. SAFETY AND EFFICACY OF FOSCARNET SODIUM HAVE NOT BEEN ESTABLISHED FOR TREATMENT OF OTHER CMV INFECTIONS (e.g., PNEUMONITIS, GASTROENTERITIS); CONGENITAL OR NEONATAL CMV DISEASE; OR NONIMMUNOCOMPROMISED INDIVIDUALS.\nMucocutaneous Acyclovir Resistant HSV Infections\n- Foscarnet sodium is indicated for the treatment of acyclovir-resistant mucocutaneous HSV infections in immunocompromised patients. SAFETY AND EFFICACY OF FOSCAVIR HAVE NOT BEEN ESTABLISHED FOR TREATMENT OF OTHER HSV INFECTIONS (e.g., RETINITIS, ENCEPHALITIS); CONGENITAL OR NEONATAL HSV DISEASE; OR HSV IN NONIMMUNOCOMPROMISED INDIVIDUALS.\n\n# Dosage\nTHE RECOMMENDED DOSAGE, FREQUENCY, OR INFUSION RATES SHOULD NOT BE EXCEEDED. ALL DOSES MUST BE INDIVIDUALIZED FOR PATIENTS' RENAL FUNCTION.\nInduction Treatment\n- The recommended initial dose of foscarnet sodium for patients with normal renal function is:\n- For CMV retinitis patients, either 90 mg/kg (1-1/2 to 2 hour infusion) every twelve hours or 60 mg/kg (minimum one hour infusion) every eight hours over 2-3 weeks depending on clinical response.\n- For acyclovir-resistant HSV patients, 40 mg/kg (minimum one hour infusion) either every 8 or 12 hours for 2-3 weeks or until healed.\n- An infusion pump must be used to control the rate of infusion. Adequate hydration is recommended to establish a diuresis (see HYDRATION FOR RECOMMENDATION), both prior to and during treatment to minimize renal toxicity, provided there are no clinical contraindications.\nMaintenance Treatment\n- Following induction treatment the recommended maintenance dose of foscarnet sodium for CMV retinitis is 90 mg/kg/day to 120 mg/kg/day (individualized for renal function) given as an intravenous infusion over 2 hours. Because the superiority of the 120 mg/kg/day has not been established in controlled trials, and given the likely relationship of higher plasma foscarnet levels to toxicity, it is recommended that most patients be started on maintenance treatment with a dose of 90 mg/kg/day. Escalation to 120 mg/kg/day may be considered should early re induction be required because of retinitis progression. Some patients who show excellent tolerance to foscarnet sodium may benefit from initiation of maintenance treatment at 120 mg/kg/day earlier in their treatment.\n- An infusion pump must be used to control the rate of infusion with all doses. Again, hydration to establish diuresis both prior to and during treatment is recommended to minimize renal toxicity, provided there are no clinical contraindications.\n- Patients who experience progression of retinitis while receiving foscarnet sodium maintenance therapy may be retreated with the induction and maintenance regimens given above or with a combination of foscarnet sodium and ganciclovir. Because of physical incompatibility, foscarnet sodium and ganciclovir must not be mixed.\nUse in Patients with Abnormal Renal Function\n- foscarnet sodium should be used with caution in patients with abnormal renal function because reduced plasma clearance of foscarnet will result in elevated plasma levels. In addition, foscarnet sodium has the potential to further impair renal function. Safety and efficacy data for patients with baseline serum creatinine levels greater than 2.8 mg/dL or measured 24-hour creatinine clearances < 50 mL/min are limited.\n- Renal function must be monitored carefully at baseline and during induction and maintenance therapy with appropriate dose adjustments for foscarnet sodium as outlined below .During foscarnet sodium therapy if creatinine clearance falls below the limits of the dosing nomograms (0.4 mL/min/kg), foscarnet sodium should be discontinued, the patient hydrated, and monitored daily until resolution of renal impairment is ensured.\n- Foscarnet sodium is not recommended in patients undergoing hemodialysis because dosage guidelines have not been established.\nDose Adjustment\n- Foscarnet sodium dosing must be individualized according to the patient's renal function status. Refer to TABLE 13 below for recommended doses and adjust the dose as indicated. Even patients with serum creatinine in the normal range may require dose adjustment; therefore, the dose should be calculated at baseline and frequently thereafter.\n- To use this dosing guide, actual 24-hour creatinine clearance (mL/min) must be divided by body weight (kg), or the estimated creatinine clearance in mL/min/kg can be calculated from serum creatinine (mg/dL) using the following formula (modified Cockcroft and Gault equation):\n\n## Off-Label Use and Dosage (Adult)\n\n### Guideline-Supported Use\nThere is limited information regarding Off-Label Guideline-Supported Use of Foscarnet sodium in adult patients.\n\n### Non–Guideline-Supported Use\n\n# Indication\n- Cytomegaloviral pneumonia\n\n# Pediatric Indications and Dosage\n\n## FDA-Labeled Indications and Dosage (Pediatric)\nThere is limited information regarding FDA-Labeled Use of Foscarnet sodium in pediatric patients.\n\n## Off-Label Use and Dosage (Pediatric)\n\n### Guideline-Supported Use\nThere is limited information regarding Off-Label Guideline-Supported Use of Foscarnet sodium in pediatric patients.\n\n### Non–Guideline-Supported Use\nThere is limited information regarding Off-Label Non–Guideline-Supported Use of Foscarnet sodium in pediatric patients.\n\n# Contraindications\n- FOSCAVIR is contraindicated in patients with clinically significant hypersensitivity to foscarnet sodium.\n\n# Warnings\nRenal Impairment\n- THE MAJOR TOXICITY OF FOSCARNET SODIUM IS RENAL IMPAIRMENT. Renal impairment is most likely to become clinically evident during the second week of induction therapy, but may occur at any time during foscarnet sodium treatment. Renal function should be monitored carefully during both induction and maintenance therapy. Elevations in serum creatinine are usually, but not always, reversible following discontinuation or dose adjustment of FOSCAVIR. Safety and efficacy data for patients with baseline serum creatinine levels greater than 2.8 mg/dL or measured 24-hour creatinine clearances <50 mL/min are limited.\n- SINCE FOSCARNET SODIUM HAS THE POTENTIAL TO CAUSE RENAL IMPAIRMENT, DOSE ADJUSTMENT BASED ON SERUM CREATININE IS NECESSARY. Hydration may reduce the risk of nephrotoxicity. It is recommended that 750–1000 mL of normal saline or 5% dextrose solution should be given prior to the first infusion of foscarnet sodium to establish diuresis. With subsequent infusions, 750–1000 mL of hydration fluid should be given with 90-120 mg/kg of foscarnet sodium, and 500 mL with 40–60 mg/kg of foscarnet sodium. Hydration fluid may need to be decreased if clinically warranted.\n- After the first dose, the hydration fluid should be administered concurrently with each infusion of foscarnet sodium.\nMineral and Electrolyte Abnormalities\n- Foscarnet sodium has been associated with changes in serum electrolytes including hypocalcemia, hypophosphatemia, hyperphosphatemia, hypomagnesemia, and hypokalemia. Foscarnet sodium may also be associated with a dose-related decrease in ionized serum calcium which may not be reflected in total serum calcium. This effect is likely to be related to chelation of divalent metal ions such as calcium by foscarnet. Patients should be advised to report symptoms of low ionized calcium such as perioral tingling, numbness in the extremities and paresthesias. Particular caution and careful management of serum electrolytes is advised in patients with altered calcium or other electrolyte levels before treatment and especially in those with neurologic or cardiac abnormalities and those receiving other drugs known to influence minerals and electrolytes . Physicians should be prepared to treat these abnormalities and their sequelae such as tetany, seizures or cardiac disturbances. The rate of foscarnet sodium infusion may also affect the decrease in ionized calcium. Therefore, an infusion pump must be used for administration to prevent rapid intravenous infusion. Slowing the infusion rate may decrease or prevent symptoms.\nSeizures\n- Seizures related to mineral and electrolyte abnormalities have been associated with foscarnet sodium treatment. Several cases of seizures were associated with death. Risk factors associated with seizures included impaired baseline renal function, low total serum calcium, and underlying CNS conditions.\n\n# Adverse Reactions\n\n## Clinical Trials Experience\n- THE MAJOR TOXICITY OF FOSCAVIR IS RENAL IMPAIRMENT. Approximately 33% of 189 patients with AIDS and CMV retinitis who received foscarnet sodium (60 mg/kg TID), without adequate hydration, developed significant impairment of renal function (serum creatinine ≥ 2.0 mg/dL). The incidence of renal impairment in subsequent clinical trials in which 1000 mL of normal saline or 5% dextrose solution was given with each infusion of foscarnet sodium was 12% (34/280).\n- Foscarnet sodium has been associated with changes in serum electrolytes including hypocalcemia (15-30%), hypophosphatemia (8–26%) and hyperphosphatemia (6%), hypomagnesemia (15–30%), and hypokalemia (16–48%). The higher percentages were derived from those patients receiving hydration.\n- Foscarnet sodium treatment was associated with seizures in 18/189 (10%) AIDS patients in the initial five controlled studies. Risk factors associated with seizures included impaired baseline renal function, low total serum calcium, and underlying CNS conditions predisposing the patient to seizures. The rate of seizures did not increase with duration of treatment. Three cases were associated with overdoses of foscarnet sodium.\n- In five controlled U.S. clinical trials the most frequently reported adverse events in patients with AIDS and CMV retinitis are shown in TABLE 9. These figures were calculated without reference to drug relationship or severity.\n- From the same controlled studies, adverse events categorized by investigator as “severe” are shown in TABLE 10. Although death was specifically attributed to foscarnet sodium in only one case, other complications of foscarnet sodium (i.e., renal impairment, electrolyte abnormalities, and seizures) may have contributed to patient deaths.\n- From the five initial U.S. controlled trials of foscarnet sodium, the following list of adverse events has been compiled regardless of causal relationship to foscarnet sodium. Evaluation of these reports was difficult because of the diverse manifestations of the underlying disease and because most patients received numerous concomitant medications.\nIncidence of 5% or Greater\n- Body as a Whole: fever, fatigue, rigors, asthenia, malaise, pain, infection, sepsis, death\n- Central and Peripheral Nervous System: headache, paresthesia, dizziness, involuntary muscle contractions, hypoesthesia, neuropathy, seizures including grand mal seizures\n- Gastrointestinal System: anorexia, nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal pain\n- Hematologic: anemia, granulocytopenia, leukopenia, neutropenia\n- Metabolic and Nutritional: mineral and electrolyte imbalances  including hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia, hypophosphatemia, hyperphosphatemia\n- Psychiatric: depression, confusion, anxiety\n- Respiratory System: coughing, dyspnea\n- Skin and Appendages: rash, increased sweating\n- Urinary: alterations in renal function including increased serum creatinine, decreased creatinine clearance, and abnormal renal function\n- Special Senses: vision abnormalities\n- Urinary System: albuminuria, dysuria, polyuria, urethral disorder, urinary retention, urinary tract infections, acute renal failure, nocturia, facial edema\n- Selected adverse events occurring at a rate of less than 1% in the five initial U.S. controlled clinical trials of foscarnet sodium include: syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion, pancytopenia, hematuria, dehydration, hypoproteinemia, increases in amylase and creatinine phosphokinase, cardiac arrest, coma, and other cardiovascular and neurologic complications.\n- Selected adverse event data from the Foscarnet vs. Ganciclovir CMV Retinitis Trial (FGCRT), performed by the Studies of the Ocular Complications of AIDS (SOCA) Research Group, are shown in TABLE 11.\n- Selected adverse events from ACTG Study 228 (CRRT) comparing combination therapy with foscarnet sodium or ganciclovir monotherapy are shown in TABLE 12. The most common reason for a treatment change in patients assigned to either foscarnet sodium or ganciclovir was retinitis progression. The most frequent reason for a treatment change in the combination treatment group was toxicity.\n\n## Postmarketing Experience\n- Adverse events that have been reported in post-marketing surveillance include: ventricular arrhythmia, prolongation of QT interval, gamma GT increased, diabetes insipidus (usually nephrogenic), renal calculus, esophageal ulceration, renal tubular acidosis, renal tubular necrosis, crystal-induced nephropathy and muscle disorders including myopathy, myositis, muscle weakness and rare cases of rhabdomyolysis. Cases of vesiculobullous eruptions including erythema multiforme, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and Stevens-Johnson Syndrome have been reported. In most cases, patients were taking other medications that have been associated with toxic epidermal necrolysis or Stevens-Johnson Syndrome.\n\n# Drug Interactions\n- A possible drug interaction of foscarnet sodium and intravenous pentamidine has been described. Concomitant treatment of four patients in the United Kingdom with foscarnet sodium and intravenous pentamidine may have caused hypocalcemia; one patient died with severe hypocalcemia. Toxicity associated with concomitant use of aerosolized pentamidine has not been reported. Because foscarnet sodium can reduce serum levels of ionized calcium, extreme caution is advised when used concurrently with other drugs known to influence serum calcium levels (e.g., intravenous pentamidine). Renal impairment and symptomatic hypocalcemia have been observed during concurrent treatment with foscarnet sodium and intravenous pentamidine.\n- Because of foscarnet's tendency to cause renal impairment, the use of FOSCAVIR should be avoided in combination with potentially nephrotoxic drugs such as aminoglycosides, amphotericin B, cyclosporine, acyclovir, methotrexate, tacrolimus and intravenous pentamidine unless the potential benefits outweigh the risks to the patient.\n- When diuretics are indicated, thiazides are recommended over loop diuretics because the latter inhibit renal tubular secretion, and may impair elimination of foscarnet sodium, potentially leading to toxicity.\n- Abnormal renal function has been observed in clinical practice during the use of foscarnet sodium and ritonavir, or foscarnet sodium, ritonavir, and saquinavir.\n\n# Use in Specific Populations\n\n### Pregnancy\nPregnancy Category (FDA):\n- Pregnancy, Category C: There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of foscarnet sodium in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.\n- Animal Data: foscarnet sodium did not adversely affect fertility and general reproductive performance in rats. The results of peri- and post-natal studies in rats were also negative. However, these studies used exposures that are inadequate to define the potential for impairment of fertility at human drug exposure levels.\n- Daily subcutaneous doses up to 75 mg/kg administered to female rats prior to and during mating, during gestation, and 21 days post-partum caused a slight increase (< 5%) in the number of skeletal anomalies compared with the control group. Daily subcutaneous doses up to 75 mg/kg administered to rabbits and 150 mg/kg administered to rats during gestation caused an increase in the frequency of skeletal anomalies/variations. On the basis of estimated drug exposure (as measured by AUC), the 150 mg/kg dose in rats and 75 mg/kg dose in rabbits were approximately one-eighth (rat) and one-third (rabbit) the estimated maximal daily human exposure. These studies are inadequate to define the potential teratogenicity at levels to which women will be exposed.\nPregnancy Category (AUS):\n- Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) Pregnancy Category\nThere is no Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) guidance on usage of Foscarnet sodium in women who are pregnant.\n\n### Labor and Delivery\nThere is no FDA guidance on use of Foscarnet sodium during labor and delivery.\n\n### Nursing Mothers\n- It is not known whether foscarnet sodium is excreted in human milk; however, in lactating rats administered 75 mg/kg, foscarnet sodium was excreted in maternal milk at concentrations three times higher than peak maternal blood concentrations. Because of the potential for serious adverse events in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue drug, taking into consideration the importance of the drug to the mother. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend that HIV-infected mothers not breast-feed their infants to avoid risking postnatal transmission of HIV.\n\n### Pediatric Use\n- The safety and effectiveness of foscarnet sodium in pediatric patients have not been established. foscarnet sodium is deposited in teeth and bone and deposition is greater in young and growing animals. foscarnet sodium has been demonstrated to adversely affect development of tooth enamel in mice and rats. The effects of this deposition on skeletal development have not been studied. Since deposition in human bone has also been shown to occur, it is likely that it does so to a greater degree in developing bone in pediatric patients. Administration to pediatric patients should be undertaken only after careful evaluation and only if the potential benefits for treatment outweigh the risks.\n\n### Geriatic Use\n- No studies of the efficacy or safety of foscarnet sodium in persons 65 years of age or older have been conducted. However, foscarnet sodium has been used in patients age 65 years of age and older. The pattern of adverse events seen in these patients is consistent across all age groups. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and renal function should be monitored.\n\n### Gender\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Foscarnet sodium with respect to specific gender populations.\n\n### Race\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Foscarnet sodium with respect to specific racial populations.\n\n### Renal Impairment\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Foscarnet sodium in patients with renal impairment.\n\n### Hepatic Impairment\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Foscarnet sodium in patients with hepatic impairment.\n\n### Females of Reproductive Potential and Males\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Foscarnet sodium in women of reproductive potentials and males.\n\n### Immunocompromised Patients\nThere is no FDA guidance one the use of Foscarnet sodium in patients who are immunocompromised.\n\n# Administration and Monitoring\n\n### Administration\n- Intravenous\n'CAUTION—DO NOT ADMINISTER FOSCARNET SODIUM BY RAPID OR BOLUS INTRAVENOUS INJECTION. THE TOXICITY OF FOSCARNET SODIUM MAY BE INCREASED AS A RESULT OF EXCESSIVE PLASMA LEVELS. CARE SHOULD BE TAKEN TO AVOID UNINTENTIONAL OVERDOSE BY CAREFULLY CONTROLLING THE RATE OF INFUSION. THEREFORE, AN INFUSION PUMP MUST BE USED. IN SPITE OF THE USE OF AN INFUSION PUMP, OVERDOSES HAVE OCCURRED.\n\n### Monitoring\n- The majority of patients will experience some decrease in renal function due to foscarnet sodium administration. Therefore it is recommended that creatinine clearance, either measured or estimated using the modified Cockcroft and Gault equation based on serum creatinine, be determined at baseline, 2–3 times per week during induction therapy and once weekly during maintenance therapy, with foscarnet sodium dose adjusted accordingly. More frequent monitoring may be required for some patients. It is also recommended that a 24-hour creatinine clearance be determined at baseline and periodically thereafter to ensure correct dosing (assuming verification of an adequate collection using creatinine index). Foscarnet sodium should be discontinued if creatinine clearance drops below 0.4 mL/min/kg.\n- Due to foscarnet sodium propensity to chelate divalent metal ions and alter levels of serum electrolytes, patients must be monitored closely for such changes. It is recommended that a schedule similar to that recommended for serum creatinine (see above) be used to monitor serum calcium, magnesium, potassium and phosphorus. Particular caution is advised in patients with decreased total serum calcium or other electrolyte levels before treatment, as well as in patients with neurologic or cardiac abnormalities, and in patients receiving other drugs known to influence serum calcium levels. Any clinically significant metabolic changes should be corrected. Also, patients who experience mild (e.g., perioral numbness or paresthesias) or severe (e.g., seizures) symptoms of electrolyte abnormalities should have serum electrolyte and mineral levels assessed as close in time to the event as possible.\n- Careful monitoring and appropriate management of electrolytes, calcium, magnesium and creatinine are of particular importance in patients with conditions that may predispose them to seizures.\n\n# IV Compatibility\nThere is limited information regarding IV Compatibility of Foscarnet sodium in the drug label.\n\n# Overdosage\n- In controlled clinical trials performed in the United States, overdosage with foscarnet sodium was reported in 10 out of 189 patients. All 10 patients experienced adverse events and all except one made a complete recovery. One patient died after receiving a total daily dose of 12.5 g for three days instead of the intended 10.9 g. The patient suffered a grand mal seizure and became comatose. Three days later the patient expired with the cause of death listed as respiratory/cardiac arrest. The other nine patients received doses ranging from 1.14 times to 8 times their recommended doses with an average of 4 times their recommended doses. Overall, three patients had seizures, three patients had renal function impairment, four patients had paresthesias either in limbs or periorally, and five patients had documented electrolyte disturbances primarily involving calcium and phosphate.\n- Overdose (up to 20 times the recommended dose) has been reported in post-marketing use of foscarnet sodium. Some of these post-marketing reports were relative overdoses in that the dose of foscarnet sodium had not been adjusted in patients with a reduced renal function. The pattern of adverse events associated with a foscarnet sodium overdose is consistent with the known adverse event profile of the drug.\n- There is no specific antidote for foscarnet sodium overdose. Hemodialysis and hydration may be of benefit in reducing drug plasma levels in patients who receive an overdosage of FOSCAVIR, but the effectiveness of these interventions has not been evaluated. The patient should be observed for signs and symptoms of renal impairment and electrolyte imbalance. Medical treatment should be instituted if clinically warranted.\n\n# Pharmacology\n\n## Mechanism of Action\nThere is limited information regarding Foscarnet sodium Mechanism of Action in the drug label.\n\n## Structure\n- FOSCAVIR is the brand name for foscarnet sodium. The chemical name of foscarnet sodium is phosphonoformic acid, trisodium salt. Foscarnet sodium is a white, crystalline powder containing 6 equivalents of water of hydration with an empirical formula of Na3CO5P6 H20 and a molecular weight of 300.1. The structural formula is:\n- FOSCAVIR has the potential to chelate divalent metal ions, such as calcium and magnesium, to form stable coordination compounds. FOSCAVIR INJECTION is a sterile, isotonic aqueous solution for intravenous administration only. The solution is clear and colorless. Each milliliter of FOSCAVIR contains 24 mg of foscarnet sodium hexahydrate in Water for Injection, USP. Hydrochloric acid may have been added to adjust the pH of the solution to 7.4. FOSCAVIR INJECTION contains no preservatives.\n\n## Pharmacodynamics\nThere is limited information regarding Pharmacodynamics of Foscarnet sodium in the drug label.\n\n## Pharmacokinetics\n- The pharmacokinetics of foscarnet has been determined after administration as an intermittent intravenous infusion during induction therapy in AIDS patients with CMV retinitis. Observed plasma foscarnet concentrations in four studies (FOS-01, ACTG-015, FP48PK, FP49PK) are summarized in TABLE 7:\nDistribution\n- In vitro studies have shown that 14 – 17% of foscarnet is protein bound at plasma drug concentrations of 1 – 1000 μM.\n- The foscarnet terminal half-life determined by urinary excretion was 87.5 ± 41.8 hours, possibly due to release of foscarnet from bone. Postmortem data on several patients in European clinical trials provide evidence that foscarnet does accumulate in bone in humans; however, the extent to which this occurs has not been determined.\nSpecial Populations\n- Adults with Impaired Renal Function: The pharmacokinetic properties of foscarnet have been determined in a small group of adult subjects with normal and impaired renal function, as summarized in TABLE 8:\nTotal systemic clearance (CL) of foscarnet decreased and half-life increased with diminishing renal function (as expressed by creatinine clearance). Based on these observations, it is necessary to modify the dosage of foscarnet in patients with renal impairment.\nDrug Interaction\n- The pharmacokinetics of foscarnet and ganciclovir were not altered in 13 patients receiving either concomitant therapy or daily alternating therapy for maintenance of CMV disease.\n- There is no clinically significant interaction with zidovudine (AZT), or probenecid.\n\n## Nonclinical Toxicology\nCarcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility\n- Carcinogenicity studies were conducted in rats and mice at oral doses of 500 mg/kg/day and 250 mg/kg/day. Oral bioavailability in unfasted rodents is < 20%. No evidence of oncogenicity was reported at plasma drug levels equal to 1/3 and 1/5, respectively, of those in humans (at the maximum recommended human daily dose) as measured by the area-under-the-time/concentration curve (AUC).\n- Foscarnet sodium showed genotoxic effects in the BALB/3T3 in vitro transformation assay at concentrations greater than 0.5 mcg/mL and an increased frequency of chromosome aberrations in the sister chromatid exchange assay at 1000 mcg/mL. A high dose of foscarnet (350 mg/kg) caused an increase in micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes in vivo in mice at doses that produced exposures (area under curve) comparable to that anticipated clinically.\n\n# Clinical Studies\nCMV Retinitis\n- A prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trial (FOS-03) was conducted in 24 patients with AIDS and CMV retinitis comparing treatment with foscarnet sodium to no treatment. Patients received induction treatment of foscarnet sodium, 60 mg/kg every 8 hours for 3 weeks, followed by maintenance treatment with 90 mg/kg/day until retinitis progression (appearance of a new lesion or advancement of the border of a posterior lesion greater than 750 microns in diameter). All diagnoses and determinations of retinitis progression were made from masked reading of retinal photographs. The 13 patients randomized to treatment with foscarnet sodium had a significant delay in progression of CMV retinitis compared to untreated controls. Median times to retinitis progression from study entry were 93 days (range 21 – >364) and 22 days (range 7 – 42), respectively.\n- In another prospective clinical trial of CMV retinitis in patients with AIDS (ACTG-915), 33 patients were treated with two to three weeks of foscarnet sodium induction (60 mg/kg TID) and then randomized to either 90 mg/kg/day or 120 mg/kg/day maintenance therapy. The median times from study entry to retinitis progression were not significantly different between the treatment groups, 96 (range 14 – >176) days and 140 (range 16 – >233) days, respectively.\n- In study ACTG 129/FGCRT SOCA study 107 patients with newly diagnosed CMV retinitis were randomized to treatment with foscarnet sodium (induction: 60 mg/kg TID for 2 weeks; maintenance: 90 mg/kg QD) and 127 were randomized to treatment with ganciclovir (induction: 5 mg/kg BID; maintenance: 5 mg/kg QD). The median time to progression on the two drugs was similar (Fos=59 and Gcv=56 days).\nRelapsed CMV Retinitis\n- The CMV Retinitis Retreatment Trial (ACTG 228/SOCA CRRT) was a randomized, open-label comparison of foscarnet sodium or ganciclovir monotherapy to the combination of both drugs for the treatment of persistently active or relapsed CMV retinitis in patients with AIDS. Subjects were randomized to one of the three treatments: foscarnet sodium 90 mg/kg BID induction followed by 120 mg/kg QD maintenance (Fos); ganciclovir 5 mg/kg BID induction followed by 10 mg/kg QD maintenance (Gcv); or the combination of the two drugs, consisting of continuation of the subject's current therapy and induction dosing of the other drug (as above), followed by maintenance with foscarnet sodium 90 mg/kg QD plus ganciclovir 5 mg/kg QD (Cmb). Assessment of retinitis progression was performed by masked evaluation of retinal photographs. The median times to retinitis progression or death were 39 days for the foscarnet sodium group, 61 days for the ganciclovir group and 105 days for the combination group. For the alternative endpoint of retinitis progression (censoring on death), the median times were 39 days for the foscarnet sodium group, 61 days for the ganciclovir group and 132 days for the combination group. Due to censoring on death, the latter analysis may overestimate the treatment effect. Treatment modifications due to toxicity were more common in the combination group than in the foscarnet sodium or ganciclovir monotherapy groups.\nMucocutaneous Acyclovir Resistant HSV Infections\n- In a controlled trial, patients with AIDS and mucocutaneous, acyclovir-resistant HSV infection were randomized to either foscarnet sodium (N=8) at a dose of 40 mg/kg TID or vidarabine (N=6) at a dose of 15 mg/kg per day. Eleven patients were nonrandomly assigned to receive treatment with foscarnet sodium because of prior intolerance to vidarabine. Lesions in the eight patients randomized to foscarnet sodium healed after 11 to 25 days; seven of the 11 patients nonrandomly treated with foscarnet sodium healed their lesions in 10 to 30 days. Vidarabine was discontinued because of intolerance (N=4) or poor therapeutic response (N=2). In a second trial, forty AIDS patients and three bone marrow transplant recipients with mucocutaneous, acyclovir-resistant HSV infections were randomized to receive foscarnet sodium at a dose of either 40 mg/kg BID or 40 mg/kg TID. Fifteen of the 43 patients had healing of their lesions in 11 to 72 days with no difference in response between the two treatment groups.\n\n# How Supplied\n- foscarnet sodium (foscarnet sodium) INJECTION, 24 mg/mL for intravenous infusion, is supplied in 250 mL glass bottles containing 6000 mg foscarnet sodium (24 mg/mL) as follows:\n- NDC 76310-024-01 250 mL bottles, cases of 10\n- For Single Use Only.\n\n## Storage\n- Store between 20° and 25°C (68° and 77°F) . Protect from excessive heat (above 40°C) and from freezing. If refrigerated or exposed to temperatures below the freezing point, precipitation may occur. By keeping the bottle at room temperature with repeated shaking, the precipitate can be brought into solution again.\n- foscarnet sodium injection should be used only if the bottle and seal are intact, a vacuum is present, and the solution is clear and colorless.\n\n# Images\n\n## Drug Images\n\n## Package and Label Display Panel\n\n# Patient Counseling Information\n- Information for Patients\n- CMV Retinitis: Patients should be advised that foscarnet sodium is not a cure for CMV retinitis, and that they may continue to experience progression of retinitis during or following treatment. They should be advised to have regular ophthalmologic examinations.\n- Mucocutaneous Acyclovir-Resistant HSV Infections: Patients should be advised that foscarnet sodium is not a cure for HSV infections. While complete healing is possible, relapse occurs in most patients. Because relapse may be due to acyclovir-sensitive HSV, sensitivity testing of the viral isolate is advised. In addition, repeated treatment with foscarnet sodium has led to the development of resistance associated with poorer response. In the case of poor therapeutic response, sensitivity testing of the viral isolate also is advised.\n- Effects on Ability to Drive and Use Machines: Adverse effects such as dizziness and convulsions may occur during foscarnet sodium therapy. Patients who experience seizures, dizziness, somnolence or other adverse reactions that could result in impairment, should be advised to avoid driving or operating machinery.\n- General: Patients should be informed that the major toxicities of foscarnet are renal impairment, electrolyte disturbances, and seizures, and that dose modifications and possibly discontinuation may be required. The importance of close monitoring while on therapy must be emphasized. Patients should be advised of the importance of reporting to their physicians symptoms of perioral tingling, numbness in the extremities or paresthesias during or after infusion as possible symptoms of electrolyte abnormalities. Should such symptoms occur, the infusion of FOSCAVIR should be stopped, appropriate laboratory samples for assessment of electrolyte concentrations obtained, and a physician consulted before resuming treatment. The rate of infusion must be no more than 1 mg/kg/minute. The potential for renal impairment may be minimized by accompanying FOSCAVIR administration with hydration adequate to establish and maintain a diuresis during dosing.\n\n# Precautions with Alcohol\n- Alcohol-Foscarnet sodium interaction has not been established.

{"guideline_text": "Ureter\nSteven C. Campbell, M.D., Ph.D.\n\n# Overview\nIn human anatomy, the ureters are the ducts that carry urine from the kidneys to the urinary bladder, passing anterior to the psoas major. The ureters are muscular tubes that can propel urine along by the motions of peristalsis. In the adult, the ureters are usually 25-30cm long.\nIn humans, the ureters enter the bladder through the back, running within the wall of the bladder for a few centimetres. There are no valves in the ureters, backflow being prevented by pressure from the filling of the bladder, as well as the tone of the muscle in the bladder wall.\nIn the female, the ureters pass through the mesometrium on the way to the urinary bladder.\n\n# Histology\nThe ureter has a diameter of about 3 millimeters, and the lumen is star-shaped. Like the bladder, it is lined with transitional epithelium, and contains layers of smooth muscle.\nThe epithelial cells of the ureter are stratified (in many layers), are normally round in shape but become squamous (flat) when stretched. The lamina propria is thick and elastic (as it is important that it is impermeable).\nThere are two spiral layers of smooth muscle in the ureter wall, an inner loose spiral, and an outer tight spiral. The inner loose spiral is sometimes described as longitudinal, and the outer as circular, (this is the opposite to the situation in the gastrointestinal tract).  The distal third of the ureter contains another layer of outer longitudinal muscle.\nThe adventitia of the ureter, like elsewhere is composed of fibrous connective tissue, that binds it to adjacent tissues.\n\n# Diseases and disorders\nMedical problems that can affect the ureter include:\n- Cancer of the ureter\n- Passage of kidney stones\n- Ureterocele\n- Megaureter\n- Vesico-ureteric reflux\n- Anatomical abnormalities, such as duplexing and ectopia", "source": "wikidoc", "question": "According to authoritative anatomical guidance, discuss how the macroscopic course and histological structure of the human ureter explain its normal function in urine transport, contribute to the pathogenesis and clinical features of common ureteral disorders (such as passage of renal stones, vesico‑ureteric reflux, and ureterocele), and inform key surgical considerations for protecting the ureter—particularly in the female pelvis."}
{"guideline_text": "Cocoa\nCocoa is the dried and partially fermented fatty seed of the cacao tree from which chocolate is made.  \"Cocoa\" can often also refer to cocoa powder, the dry powder made by grinding cocoa seeds and removing the cocoa butter from the dark, bitter cocoa solids; or it may refer to the combination of both cocoa powder and cocoa butter together .\nA cocoa pod has a rough leathery rind about 3 cm thick (this varies with the origin and variety of pod). It is filled with sweet, mucilaginous  pulp called 'baba de cacao' in South America, enclosing 30 to 50 large almond-like seeds (beans) that are fairly soft and pinkish or purplish in color.\nCocoa should not be confused with the coca plant which is used to create cocaine.\n\n# History\nThe cacao tree may have originated in the foothills of the Andes in the Amazon and Orinoco basins of South America where today, examples of wild cacao still can be found.  However, it may have had a larger range in the past, evidence for which may be obscured because of its cultivation in these areas long before, as well as after, the Spanish arrived. It may have been introduced into Central America by the ancientMayas, and cultivated in Mexico by the Toltecs and later by the Aztecs.  It was a common currency throughout MesoAmerica and the Caribbean before the Spanish conquests.\nCacao trees will grow in a limited geographical zone, of approximately 20 degrees to the north and south of the Equator. Nearly 70% of the world crop is grown in West Africa.\nCocoa was an important commodity in Pre-Columbian Mesoamerica. Spanish chroniclers of the conquest of Mexico by Hernán Cortés relate that when Montezuma II, emperor of the Aztecs, dined he took no other beverage than chocolate, served in a golden goblet and eaten with a golden spoon. Flavored with vanilla and spices, his chocolate was whipped into a froth that dissolved in the mouth. No fewer than 50 pitchers of it were prepared for the emperor each day, and 2000 more for nobles of his court.\nChocolate was introduced to Europe by the Spaniards and became a popular beverage by the mid 1500s. They also introduced the cacao tree into the West Indies and the Philippines.\nThe cacao plant was first given its botanical name by Swedish natural scientist Carolus Linnaeus in his original classification of the plant kingdom, who called it \"Theobroma (\"food of the gods\") cacao\".\n\n# Production\n\n## World production\nAbout 3,000,000 tonnes of cocoa is grown each year. The global production was\nThis is an increase of 131.7% in 30 years.\nThere are three main varieties of the Theobroma cacao: Forastero, Criollo, and Trinitario. The first comprises 95% of the world production of cacao, and is the most widely used. Overall, the highest quality of cacao comes from the Criollo variety and is considered a delicacy; however, Criollo is harder to produce, hence very few countries produce it, with the majority of production coming from Venezuela (Chuao and Porcelana). The Trinitario is a mix between Criollo and Forastero.\nThe Netherlands is the leading cocoa processing country, followed by the U.S..\nCocoa and its products (including chocolate) are used world-wide. Belgium had the highest per-capita consumption at 5.5 kg in 1995/96, 10 times the world average .\n\n## Harvesting\nWhen the pods ripen, they are harvested from the trunks and branches of the Cocoa tree with a curved knife on a long pole. The pod itself is green when ready to harvest, rather than red or orange. Normally, red or orange pods are considered of a lesser quality because their flavors and aromas are poorer; these are used for industrial chocolate. The pods are either opened on the field and the seeds extracted and carried to the fermentation area on the plantation, or the whole pods are taken to the fermentation area.\n\n## Processing\nThe harvested pods are opened with a machete, the pulp and cocoa seeds are removed and the rind is discarded. The pulp and seeds are then piled in heaps, placed in bins, or laid out on grates for several days. During this time, the seeds and pulp undergo \"sweating\", where the thick pulp liquifies as it ferments. The fermented pulp trickles away, leaving cocoa seeds behind to be collected. Sweating is important for the quality of the beans, which originally have a strong bitter taste. If sweating is interrupted, the resulting cocoa may be ruined; if underdone the cocoa seed maintains a flavor similar to raw potatoes and becomes susceptible to mildew.\nThe liquified pulp is used by some cocoa producing countries to distill alcoholic spirits.\n- Boy collecting cacao\nBoy collecting cacao\n- Cacao drying under the sun\nCacao drying under the sun\n- Cacao drying square in front of church, Chuao, Venezuela.\nCacao drying square in front of church, Chuao, Venezuela.\n- Woman drying cacao\nWoman drying cacao\nThe fermented beans are dried by spreading them out over a large surface and constantly raking them. In large plantations, this is done on huge trays under the sun or by using artificial heat. Small plantations may dry their harvest on little trays or on cowhides. Finally, the beans are trodden and shuffled about (often using bare human feet) and sometimes, during this process, red clay mixed with water is sprinkled over the beans to obtain a finer color, polish, and protection against molds during shipment to factories in the United States, the Netherlands, United Kingdom, and other countries. Drying in the sun is preferable to drying by artificial means, as no extraneous flavors such as smoke or oil are introduced which might otherwise taint the flavor.\n\n## Chocolate production\nTo make 1 kg (2.2 pounds) of chocolate, about 300 to 600 beans are processed, depending on the desired cocoa content. In a factory, the beans are washed and roasted. Next they are de-hulled by a \"nibber\" machine that also removes the germ. The nibs are what is left of the bean after this process, and are ground between three sets of stones into a thick creamy paste, known as chocolate liquor.  This \"liquor\" is separated into cocoa powder and  cocoa fat (cocoa butter) using a hydraulic press or the Broma process. This process produces around 50% cocoa butter and 50% cocoa powder. Standard cocoa powder has a fat content of approximately 10-12 percent. Cocoa butter is used in chocolate bar manufacture, other confectionery, soaps, and cosmetics.\nAdding an alkali produces Dutch process cocoa powder, which is less acidic, darker and more mellow in flavor than what is generally available in most of the world. Regular (nonalkalized) cocoa is acidic, so when added to an alkaline ingredient like baking soda, the two react and leave a byproduct.\n\n# Problems in the use of cocoa as a commodity\n- Cocoa farmers in many countries lack information on production and marketing practices to help them improve their livelihoods. Charities such as the World Cocoa Foundation helps to support sustainable cocoa efforts through public-private partnerships in cocoa growing regions.\n- Child slavery has commonly been used in its production to cover the lower profit margin.  According to the U.S. Department of State, more than 109,000 children were working on cocoa farms in Côte d'Ivoire (Ivory Coast) in 'the worst forms of child labor' in 2002. See Cocoa Protocol for an effort to end this practice.  The Cocoa Protocol has been critiqued by a number of groups including the International Labor Rights Fund since it is an industry initiative which has failed to meet its goals of phasing out child labor in the industry.\n- Natural pollination is exclusively by midges, which may be affected by pesticides. Pollination is also carried out manually.\n- Many cocoa farmers receive a low price for their production. This has led to cocoa and chocolate being available as fairtrade items in some countries. However, this fair trade remains as a tiny percentage of the total trade.\n\n# Cocoa trading\nCocoa beans, Cocoa butter and cocoa powder are traded on two world exchanges: London and New York. The London market is based on West African cocoa and New York on cocoa predominantly from South East Asia. Cocoa is the world's smallest soft commodity market.\nThe futures price of cocoa butter and cocoa powder is determined by multiplying the bean price by a ratio. The combined butter and powder ratio has tended to be around 3.5. If the combined ratio falls below around 3.2, production ceases to be economically viable and some factories cease extraction of butter and powder and trade exclusively in cocoa liquor.\nFile:WikCOCOA.jpg\n\n# Health benefits of cocoa consumption\nChocolate and cocoa contain a high level of flavonoids, specifically epicatechin, which may have beneficial cardiovascular effects on health.\nThe ingestion of flavonol-rich cocoa is associated with acute elevation of circulating Nitrous oxide, enhanced flow-mediated vasodilation, and augmented microcirculation.\nProlonged intake of flavonol-rich cocoa has been linked to cardiovascular health benefits, though it should be noted that this refers to plain cocoa. Milk chocolate's addition of whole milk reduces the overall cocoa content per ounce while increasing saturated fat levels, possibly negating some of cocoa's heart-healthy potential benefits. Nevertheless, studies have still found short term benefits in LDL cholesterol levels from dark chocolate consumption. \nHollenberg and colleagues of Harvard Medical School studied the effects of cocoa and flavanols on Panama's Kuna Indian population, who are heavy consumers of cocoa. The researchers found that the Kuna Indians living on the islands had significantly lower rates of heart disease and cancer compared to those on the mainland who do not drink cocoa as on the islands. It is believed that the improved blood flow after consumption of flavanol-rich cocoa may help to achieve health benefits in hearts and other organs. In particular, the benefits may extend to the brain and have important implications for learning and memory.\nFoods rich in cocoa appear to reduce blood pressure but drinking green and black tea may not, according to an analysis of previously published research in the April 9, 2007 issue of Archives of Internal Medicine, one of the JAMA/Archives journals.\n\n# Non-human animal consumption\nChocolate is a food product with appeal not only to the human population, but to many different animals as well. However, chocolate and cocoa contain a high level of xanthines, specifically theobromine and to a much lesser extent caffeine, that are detrimental to the health of many animals, including dogs and cats. While these compounds have desirable effects in humans, they cannot be efficiently metabolized in many animals and can lead to cardiac and nervous system problems, and if consumed in high quantities, even lead to death. However, since the mid-2000s, some cocoa derivatives with a low concentration of xanthines, have been designed by specialized industry to be suitable for pet consumption, enabling the pet food industry to offer animal safe chocolate and cocoa flavored products. It results in products with a high concentration of fiber and proteins, while maintaining low concentrations of sugar and other carbohydrates; thus enabling it to be used to create healthy functional cocoa pet products.", "source": "wikidoc", "question": "According to an authoritative guideline, discuss how clinicians and public‑health advisers should counsel patients about cocoa and chocolate consumption, integrating the guideline's statements on cocoa definitions and varieties, production/processing factors that alter cocoa content (eg, Dutch processing, milk chocolate vs plain cocoa), the evidence on flavonoids and cardiovascular benefits, potential harms (eg, saturated fat in milk chocolate), implications for vulnerable groups (eg, pets and theobromine toxicity), and broader ethical and public‑health considerations related to cocoa sourcing (eg, child labor, fair‑trade and sustainability)."}

{"guideline_text": "Antineoplaston\n\n# Overview\nAntineoplaston (ANP) is a name used by Stanislaw Burzynski for a group of chemical compounds and mixtures for which he claims anti-cancer activity. These compounds have been sold and administered by Burzynski to cancer patients since 1986; clinical efficacy has not been demonstrated and several fatal side effects have occurred. The practice is considered quackery by critics. Burzynski maintains corporate offices and operates a clinic in Houston, Texas where he treats patients with antineoplastons.  At a nearby facility in Stafford, Texas he conducts research and manufactures the pharmaceutical ingredients used in the medications and other products that he produces.\n\n# Background\nIn 1967 Stanislaw Burzynski began investigating the use of antineoplastons after noting significant peptide deficiencies in the blood of cancer patients as compared with a control group. Burzynski initially derived antineoplastons from human blood.  Since similar peptides had been isolated from urine, in 1970 Burzynski switched to urine as a cheaper source of antinoeplastons.  Since 1980 he has been reproducing his compounds synthetically. Since his initial discovery, Burzynski has isolated dozens of peptide fractions from urine, some of which have been reportedly found to be active against cancer with low toxicity.\nThe first active peptide fraction identified was called antineoplaston A-10 (3-phenylacetylamino-2,6-piperidinedione).  From A-10, antineoplaston AS2-1, a 4:1 mixture of phenylacetic acid and phenylacetylglutamine, was derived .  The active ingredient of antineoplaston A10-I is phenylacetylglutamine .\nPhenylacetic acid is a toxic compound that the body produces during normal metabolism. It is detoxified in the liver to phenylacetyl glutamine. The \"antineoplaston A-10\" compound is an isolation artifact resulting from heating the urine under acidic conditions. The \"antineoplaston AS2-1\" mixture is the result of an alkaline hydrolysis of \"antineoplaston A-10\". All compounds are widely available cheap chemicals.\n\n# Treatment with Antineoplastons\nFor legal reasons Burzynski currently sells his treatments only in the context of clinical trials. Patients receiving cancer treatment with antineoplastons must first qualify for one of the currently available clinical trials.  In order to qualify for most of the trials, a patient must have first failed standard treatment for the condition being treated, or it must be a condition that is unlikely to respond to currently available therapy and for which no curative therapy exists. Antineoplastons may be administered intravenously or orally.  Patients who respond positively to initial treatment with intravenous antineoplastons sometimes transition to the oral form. Intravenous antineoplastons are administered continuously with a portable programmable pump that the patient carries on a shoulder strap in a canvas bag.\nTreatment with antineoplastons can be very costly to patients without insurance coverage, exceeding $100,000 for the first year of intravenous treatment.  Many insurance companies consider antineoplaston therapy to be investigational and unproven and will not cover the cost. The administered \"antineoplastons\" are very cheap and widely available chemicals that cost no more than 80 cents per treatment .\n\n# Proposed mechanisms\nAntineoplastons have never shown to be effective in treating human cancer. Independent tests at at the National Cancer Institute have never been positive. The drug company Sigma-Tau Pharmaceuticals could not duplicate Burzynski's claims for AS-2.1 and A-10. The Japanese National Cancer Institute has reported that antineoplastons did not work in their studies. No scientific coauthor of Burzynski publications has endorsed his use of antineoplastons in cancer patients.\nBurzynski suggest that antineoplastons A10 and AS2-1 both work by inhibiting oncogenes, promoting apoptosis, and activating tumor suppressor genes . Several other mechanism of action have been proposed.\nOne of the factors that allows some cancers to grow out of control is the presence of abnormal enzymes, a byproduct of DNA methylation.  In the presence of these enzymes, the normal life cycle of the cells is disrupted and they replicate continuously.  Antineoplastons have been shown in the laboratory to inhibit these enzymes .\nRecent studies have shown that inhibiting histone deacetylase (HDAC) promotes the activation of tumor suppressor genes p21 and p53. Phenylacetic acid contained in the AS2-1 mixture has been shown to be a weak HDAC inhibitor.", "source": "wikidoc", "question": "According to an authoritative guideline, discuss whether antineoplaston therapy should be offered to patients with cancer, addressing the proposed mechanisms of action, the quality and results of clinical and laboratory evidence for efficacy, known safety concerns and reported adverse outcomes, the regulatory/clinical‑trial access and patient‑selection criteria described, and the cost and ethical implications for patients."}

{"guideline_text": "Sandbox 1234\nWARNING: ISCHEMIC HEART DISEASE:\nFollowing abrupt cessation of therapy with certain beta-blocking agents, exacerbations of angina pectoris and, in some cases, myocardial infarction have occurred. When discontinuing chronically administered metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets, particularly in patients with ischemic heart disease, the dosage should be gradually reduced over a period of 1 - 2 weeks and the patient should be carefully monitored. If angina markedly worsens or acute coronary insufficiency develops, metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets administration should be reinstated promptly, at least temporarily, and other measures appropriate for the management of unstable angina should be taken. Warn patients against interruption or discontinuation of therapy without the physician’s advice. Because coronary artery disease is common and may be unrecognized, it may be prudent not to discontinue metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets therapy abruptly even in patients treated only for hypertension (5.1).\n\n# INDICATIONS & USAGE\nMetoprolol succinate extended-release tablets are indicated for the treatment of hypertension. It may be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents .\nMetoprolol succinate extended-release tablets are indicated in the long-term treatment of angina pectoris, to reduce angina attacks and to improve exercise tolerance.\nMetoprolol succinate extended-release tablets are indicated for the treatment of stable, symptomatic (NYHA Class II or III) heart failure of ischemic, hypertensive, or cardiomyopathic origin. It was studied in patients already receiving ACE inhibitors, diuretics, and, in the majority of cases, digitalis. In this population, metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets decreased the rate of mortality plus hospitalization, largely through a reduction in cardiovascular mortality and hospitalizations for heart failure.\n\n# DOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION\nMetoprolol succinate extended-release is an extended release tablet intended for once daily administration. For treatment of hypertension and angina, when switching from immediate release metoprolol to metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets, use the same total daily dose of metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets. Individualize the dosage of metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets. Titration may be needed in some patients.\nMetoprolol succinate extended-release tablets are scored and can be divided; however, do not crush or chew the whole or half tablet.\nAdults: The usual initial dosage is 25 to 100 mg daily in a single dose. The dosage may be increased at weekly (or longer) intervals until optimum blood pressure reduction is achieved. In general, the maximum effect of any given dosage level will be apparent after 1 week of therapy. Dosages above 400 mg per day have not been studied.\nPediatric Hypertensive Patients ≥ 6 Years of age: A pediatric clinical hypertension study in patients 6 to 16 years of age did not meet its primary endpoint (dose response for reduction in SBP); however some other endpoints demonstrated effectiveness . If selected for treatment, the recommended starting dose of metoprolol succinate extended-release tablet is 1.0 mg/kg once daily, but the maximum initial dose should not exceed 50 mg once daily. Dosage should be adjusted according to blood pressure response. Doses above 2.0 mg/kg (or in excess of 200 mg) once daily have not been studied in pediatric patients .\nMetoprolol succinate extended-release tablet is not recommended in pediatric patients <6 years of age .\nIndividualize the dosage of metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets. The usual initial dosage is 100 mg daily, given in a single dose. Gradually increase the dosage at weekly intervals until optimum clinical response has been obtained or there is a pronounced slowing of the heart rate. Dosages above 400 mg per day have not been studied. If treatment is to be discontinued, reduce the dosage gradually over a period of 1 - 2 weeks .\nDosage must be individualized and closely monitored during up-titration. Prior to initiation of metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets, stabilize the dose of other heart failure drug therapy. The recommended starting dose of metoprolol succinate extended-release tablet is 25 mg once daily for two weeks in patients with NYHA Class II heart failure and 12.5 mg once daily in patients with more severe heart failure. Double the dose every two weeks to the highest dosage level tolerated by the patient or up to 200 mg of metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets. Initial difficulty with titration should not preclude later attempts to introduce metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets. If patients experience symptomatic bradycardia, reduce the dose of metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets. If transient worsening of heart failure occurs, consider treating with increased doses of diuretics, lowering the dose of metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets or temporarily discontinuing it. The dose of metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets should not be increased until symptoms of worsening heart failure have been stabilized.\n\n# DOSAGE FORMS & STRENGTHS\n25 mg tablets: White, oval, biconvex, film-coated scored tablet debossed with “W and 34”\n50 mg tablets: White, circular, beveled edge, biconvex, film-coated scored tablet debossed with “W”\n100 mg tablets: White, circular, beveled edge, biconvex, film-coated scored tablet debossed with “W”\n200 mg tablets: White, oval, beveled edge, biconvex, film-coated scored tablet debossed with “W737”\n\n# CONTRAINDICATIONS\nMetoprolol succinate extended-release tablets are contraindicated in severe bradycardia, second or third degree heart block, cardiogenic shock, decompensated cardiac failure, sick sinus syndrome (unless a permanent pacemaker is in place), and in patients who are hypersensitive to any component of this product.\n\n# WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS\nFollowing abrupt cessation of therapy with certain beta-blocking agents, exacerbations of angina pectoris and, in some cases, myocardial infarction have occurred. When discontinuing chronically administered metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets, particularly in patients with ischemic heart disease gradually reduce the dosage over a period of 1 - 2 weeks and monitor the patient. If angina markedly worsens or acute coronary ischemia develops, promptly reinstate metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets, and take measures appropriate for the management of unstable angina. Warn patients not to interrupt therapy without their physician's advice. Because coronary artery disease is common and may be unrecognized, avoid abruptly discontinuing metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets in patients treated only for hypertension.\nWorsening cardiac failure may occur during up-titration of metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets. If such symptoms occur, increase diuretics and restore clinical stability before advancing the dose of metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets . It may be necessary to lower the dose of metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets or temporarily discontinue it. Such episodes do not preclude subsequent successful titration of metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets.\nPATIENTS WITH BRONCHOSPASTIC DISEASES SHOULD, IN GENERAL, NOT RECEIVE BETA-BLOCKERS. Because of its relative beta1 cardio-selectivity, however, metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets may be used in patients with bronchospastic disease who do not respond to, or cannot tolerate, other antihypertensive treatment. Because beta1-selectivity is not absolute, use the lowest possible dose of metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets. Bronchodilators, including beta2-agonists, should be readily available or administered concomitantly .\nIf metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets are used in the setting of pheochromocytoma, it should be given in combination with an alpha blocker, and only after the alpha blocker has been initiated. Administration of beta-blockers alone in the setting of pheochromocytoma has been associated with a paradoxical increase in blood pressure due to the attenuation of beta-mediated vasodilatation in skeletal muscle.\nAvoid initiation of a high-dose regimen of extended release metoprolol in patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery, since such use in patients with cardiovascular risk factors has been associated with bradycardia, hypotension, stroke and death.\nChronically administered beta-blocking therapy should not be routinely withdrawn prior to major surgery, however, the impaired ability of the heart to respond to reflex adrenergic stimuli may augment the risks of general anesthesia and surgical procedures.\nBeta-blockers may mask tachycardia occurring with hypoglycemia, but other manifestations such as dizziness and sweating may not be significantly affected.\nConsider initiating metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets therapy at doses lower than those recommended for a given indication; gradually increase dosage to optimize therapy, while monitoring closely for adverse events.\nBeta-adrenergic blockade may mask certain clinical signs of hyperthyroidism, such as tachycardia. Abrupt withdrawal of beta-blockade may precipitate a thyroid storm.\nWhile taking beta-blockers, patients with a history of severe anaphylactic reactions to a variety of allergens may be more reactive to repeated challenge and may be unresponsive to the usual doses of epinephrine used to treat an allergic reaction.\nBeta-blockers can precipitate or aggravate symptoms of arterial insufficiency in patients with peripheral vascular disease.\nBecause of significant inotropic and chronotropic effects in patients treated with beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers of the verapamil and diltiazem type, caution should be exercised in patients treated with these agents concomitantly.\n\n# ADVERSE REACTIONS\nThe following adverse reactions are described elsewhere in labeling:\n- Worsening angina or myocardial infarction. \n- Worsening heart failure. \n- Worsening AV block. \nBecause clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The adverse reaction information from clinical trials does, however, provide a basis for identifying the adverse events that appear to be related to drug use and for approximating rates.\nMost adverse reactions have been mild and transient. The most common (>2%) adverse reactions are tiredness, dizziness, depression, diarrhea, shortness of breath, bradycardia, and rash.\nHeart Failure: In the MERIT-HF study comparing metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets in daily doses up to 200 mg (mean dose 159 mg once-daily; n=1990) to placebo (n=2001), 10.3% of metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets patients discontinued for adverse reactions vs. 12.2% of placebo patients.\nThe table below lists adverse reactions in the MERIT-HF study that occurred at an incidence of ≥ 1% in the metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets group and greater than placebo by more than 0.5%, regardless of the assessment of causality.\nAdverse Reactions Occurring in the MERIT-HF Study at an Incidence ≥ 1 % in the Metoprolol Succinate Extended-Release Tablets Group and Greater Than Placebo by More Than 0.5 %\nPost-operative Adverse Events: In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 8351 patients with or at risk for atherosclerotic disease undergoing non-vascular surgery and who were not taking beta-blocker therapy, metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets 100 mg was started 2 to 4 hours prior to surgery then continued for 30 days at 200 mg per day. Metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets use was associated with a higher incidence of bradycardia (6.6% vs. 2.4% ; HR 2.74; 95% CI 2.19,3.43), hypotension (15% vs. 9.7%; HR 1.55 95% CI 1.37,1.74), stroke (1.0% vs 0.5%; HR 2.17; 95% CI 1.26,3.74) and death (3.1% vs 2.3%; HR 1.33; 95% CI 1.03, 1.74) compared to placebo.\nThe following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets or immediate-release metoprolol. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.\nCardiovascular: Cold extremities, arterial insufficiency (usually of the Raynaud type), palpitations, peripheral edema, syncope, chest pain and hypotension.\nRespiratory: Wheezing (bronchospasm), dyspnea.\nCentral Nervous System: Confusion, short-term memory loss, headache, somnolence, nightmares, insomnia, anxiety/nervousness, hallucinations, paresthesia.\nGastrointestinal: Nausea, dry mouth, constipation, flatulence, heartburn, hepatitis, vomiting.\nHypersensitive Reactions: Pruritus.\nMiscellaneous: Musculoskeletal pain, arthralgia, blurred vision, decreased libido, male impotence, tinnitus, reversible alopecia, agranulocytosis, dry eyes, worsening of psoriasis, Peyronie's disease, sweating, photosensitivity, taste disturbance\nPotential Adverse Reactions: In addition, there are adverse reactions not listed above that have been reported with other beta-adrenergic blocking agents and should be considered potential adverse reactions to metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets.\nCentral Nervous System: Reversible mental depression progressing to catatonia; an acute reversible syndrome characterized by disorientation for time and place, short-term memory loss, emotional lability, clouded sensorium, and decreased performance on neuropsychometrics.\nHematologic: Agranulocytosis, nonthrombocytopenic purpura, thrombocytopenic purpura.\nHypersensitive Reactions: Laryngospasm, respiratory distress.\nClinical laboratory findings may include elevated levels of serum transaminase, alkaline phosphatase, and lactate dehydrogenase.\n\n# DRUG INTERACTIONS\nCatecholamine-depleting drugs (eg, reserpine, monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors) may have an additive effect when given with beta-blocking agents. Observe patients treated with metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets plus a catecholamine depletor for evidence of hypotension or marked bradycardia, which may produce vertigo, syncope, or postural hypotension.\nDrugs that inhibit CYP2D6 such as quinidine, fluoxetine, paroxetine, and propafenone are likely to increase metoprolol concentration. In healthy subjects with CYP2D6 extensive metabolizer phenotype, coadministration of quinidine 100 mg and immediate release metoprolol 200 mg tripled the concentration of S-metoprolol and doubled the metoprolol elimination half-life. In four patients with cardiovascular disease, coadministration of propafenone 150 mg t.i.d. with immediate release metoprolol 50 mg t.i.d. resulted in two- to five-fold increases in the steady-state concentration of metoprolol. These increases in plasma concentration would decrease the cardioselectivity of metoprolol.\nDigitalis glycosides, clonidine, diltiazem and verapamil slow atrioventricular conduction and decrease heart rate. Concomitant use with beta blockers can increase the risk of bradycardia.\nIf clonidine and a beta blocker, such as metoprolol are coadministered, withdraw the beta-blocker several days before the gradual withdrawal of clonidine because beta-blockers may exacerbate the rebound hypertension that can follow the withdrawal of clonidine. If replacing clonidine by beta-blocker therapy, delay the introduction of beta-blockers for several days after clonidine administration has stopped .\n\n# USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS\nPregnancy Category C\nMetoprolol tartrate has been shown to increase post-implantation loss and decrease neonatal survival in rats at doses up to 22 times, on a mg/m2 basis, the daily dose of 200 mg in a 60-kg patient. Distribution studies in mice confirm exposure of the fetus when metoprolol tartrate is administered to the pregnant animal. These studies have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or teratogenicity. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, use this drug during pregnancy only if clearly needed.\nMetoprolol is excreted in breast milk in very small quantities. An infant consuming 1 liter of breast milk daily would receive a dose of less than 1 mg of the drug. Consider possible infant exposure when metoprolol succinate extended-release tablet is administered to a nursing woman.\nOne hundred forty-four hypertensive pediatric patients aged 6 to 16 years were randomized to placebo or to one of three dose levels of metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets (0.2, 1.0 or 2.0 mg/kg once daily) and followed for 4 weeks. The study did not meet its primary endpoint (dose response for reduction in SBP). Some pre-specified secondary endpoints demonstrated effectiveness including:\n- Dose-response for reduction in DBP,\n- 1.0 mg/kg vs. placebo for change in SBP, and\n- 2.0 mg/kg vs. placebo for change in SBP and DBP.\nThe mean placebo corrected reductions in SBP ranged from 3 to 6 mmHg, and DBP from 1 to 5 mmHg. Mean reduction in heart rate ranged from 5 to 7 bpm but considerably greater reductions were seen in some individuals .\nNo clinically relevant differences in the adverse event profile were observed for pediatric patients aged 6 to 16 years as compared with adult patients.\nSafety and effectiveness of metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets have not been established in patients <6 years of age.\nClinical studies of metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets in hypertension did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience in hypertensive patients has not identified differences in responses between elderly and younger patients.\nOf the 1,990 patients with heart failure randomized to metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets in the MERIT-HF trial, 50% (990) were 65 years of age and older and 12% (238) were 75 years of age and older. There were no notable differences in efficacy or the rate of adverse reactions between older and younger patients.\nIn general, use a low initial starting dose in elderly patients given their greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.\nNo studies have been performed with metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets in patients with hepatic impairment. Because metoprolol succinate extended-release tablet is metabolized by the liver, metoprolol blood levels are likely to increase substantially with poor hepatic function. Therefore, initiate therapy at doses lower than those recommended for a given indication; and increase doses gradually in patients with impaired hepatic function.\nThe systemic availability and half-life of metoprolol in patients with renal failure do not differ to a clinically significant degree from those in normal subjects. No reduction in dosage is needed in patients with chronic renal failure .\n\n# OVERDOSAGE\nSigns and Symptoms - Overdosage of metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets may lead to severe bradycardia, hypotension, and cardiogenic shock. Clinical presentation can also include: atrioventricular block, heart failure, bronchospasm, hypoxia, impairment of consciousness/coma, nausea and vomiting.\nTreatment - Consider treating the patient with intensive care. Patients with myocardial infarction or heart failure may be prone to significant hemodynamic instability. Seek consultation with a regional poison control center and a medical toxicologist as needed. Beta-blocker overdose may result in significant resistance to resuscitation with adrenergic agents, including beta-agonists. On the basis of the pharmacologic actions of metoprolol, employ the following measures.\nThere is very limited experience with the use of hemodialysis to remove metoprolol, however metoprolol is not highly protein bound.\nBradycardia: Administer intravenous atropine; repeat to effect. If the response is inadequate, consider intravenous isoproterenol or other positive chronotropic agents. Evaluate the need for transvenous pacemaker insertion.\nHypotension: Treat underlying bradycardia. Consider intravenous vasopressor infusion, such as dopamine or norepinephrine.\nBronchospasm: Administer a beta2-agonist, including albuterol inhalation, or an oral theophylline derivative.\nCardiac Failure: Administer diuretics or digoxin for congestive heart failure. For cardiogenic shock, consider IV dobutamine, isoproterenol, or glucagon.\n\n# DESCRIPTION\nMetoprolol succinate is a beta1-selective (cardioselective) adrenoceptor blocking agent, for oral administration, available as extended release tablets. Metoprolol succinate extended-release tablet has been formulated to provide a controlled and predictable release of metoprolol for once-daily administration. The tablets comprise a multiple unit system containing metoprolol succinate in a multitude of controlled release pellets. Each pellet acts as a separate drug delivery unit and is designed to deliver metoprolol continuously over the dosage interval. The tablets contain 23.75, 47.5, 95 and 190 mg of metoprolol succinate equivalent to 25, 50, 100 and 200 mg of metoprolol tartrate, USP, respectively. Its chemical name is (±)1-(isopropylamino)-3--2-propanol succinate (2:1) (salt). Its structural formula is:\n\n# CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY\nHypertension: The mechanism of the antihypertensive effects of beta-blocking agents has not been elucidated. However, several possible mechanisms have been proposed: (1) competitive antagonism of catecholamines at peripheral (especially cardiac) adrenergic neuron sites, leading to decreased cardiac output; (2) a central effect leading to reduced sympathetic outflow to the periphery; and (3) suppression of renin activity.\nHeart Failure: The precise mechanism for the beneficial effects of beta-blockers in heart failure has not been elucidated.\nClinical pharmacology studies have confirmed the beta-blocking activity of metoprolol in man, as shown by (1) reduction in heart rate and cardiac output at rest and upon exercise, (2) reduction of systolic blood pressure upon exercise, (3) inhibition of isoproterenol-induced tachycardia, and (4) reduction of reflex orthostatic tachycardia.\nMetoprolol is a beta1-selective (cardioselective) adrenergic receptor blocking agent. This preferential effect is not absolute, however, and at higher plasma concentrations, metoprolol also inhibits beta2-adrenoreceptors, chiefly located in the bronchial and vascular musculature. Metoprolol has no intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, and membrane-stabilizing activity is detectable only at plasma concentrations much greater than required for beta-blockade. Animal and human experiments indicate that metoprolol slows the sinus rate and decreases AV nodal conduction.\nThe relative beta1-selectivity of metoprolol has been confirmed by the following: (1) In normal subjects, metoprolol is unable to reverse the beta2-mediated vasodilating effects of epinephrine. This contrasts with the effect of nonselective beta-blockers, which completely reverse the vasodilating effects of epinephrine. (2) In asthmatic patients, metoprolol reduces FEV1 and FVC significantly less than a nonselective beta-blocker, propranolol, at equivalent beta1-receptor blocking doses.\nThe relationship between plasma metoprolol levels and reduction in exercise heart rate is independent of the pharmaceutical formulation. Using an Emax model, the maximum effect is a 30% reduction in exercise heart rate, which is attributed to beta1-blockade. Beta1-blocking effects in the range of 30-80% of the maximal effect (approximately 8-23% reduction in exercise heart rate) correspond to metoprolol plasma concentrations from 30-540 nmol/L. The relative beta1-selectivity of metoprolol diminishes and blockade or beta2-adrenoceptors increases at plasma concentration above 300 nmol/L.\nAlthough beta-adrenergic receptor blockade is useful in the treatment of angina, hypertension, and heart failure there are situations in which sympathetic stimulation is vital. In patients with severely damaged hearts, adequate ventricular function may depend on sympathetic drive. In the presence of AV block, beta-blockade may prevent the necessary facilitating effect of sympathetic activity on conduction. Beta2-adrenergic blockade results in passive bronchial constriction by interfering with endogenous adrenergic bronchodilator activity in patients subject to bronchospasm and may also interfere with exogenous bronchodilators in such patients.\nIn other studies, treatment with metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets produced an improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction. Metoprolol succinate extended-release tablet was also shown to delay the increase in left ventricular end-systolic and end-diastolic volumes after 6 months of treatment.\nAdults: In man, absorption of metoprolol is rapid and complete. Plasma levels following oral administration of conventional metoprolol tablets, however, approximate 50% of levels following intravenous administration, indicating about 50% first-pass metabolism. Metoprolol crosses the blood-brain barrier and has been reported in the CSF in a concentration 78% of the simultaneous plasma concentration.\nPlasma levels achieved are highly variable after oral administration. Only a small fraction of the drug (about 12%) is bound to human serum albumin. Metoprolol is a racemic mixture of R- and S- enantiomers, and is primarily metabolized by CYP2D6. When administered orally, it exhibits stereoselective metabolism that is dependent on oxidation phenotype. Elimination is mainly by biotransformation in the liver, and the plasma half-life ranges from approximately 3 to 7 hours. Less than 5% of an oral dose of metoprolol is recovered unchanged in the urine; the rest is excreted by the kidneys as metabolites that appear to have no beta-blocking activity.\nFollowing intravenous administration of metoprolol, the urinary recovery of unchanged drug is approximately 10%. The systemic availability and half-life of metoprolol in patients with renal failure do not differ to a clinically significant degree from those in normal subjects. Consequently, no reduction in metoprolol succinate dosage is usually needed in patients with chronic renal failure.\nMetoprolol is metabolized predominantly by CYP2D6, an enzyme that is absent in about 8% of Caucasians (poor metabolizers) and about 2% of most other populations. CYP2D6 can be inhibited by a number of drugs. Poor metabolizers and extensive metabolizers who concomitantly use CYP2D6 inhibiting drugs will have increased (several-fold) metoprolol blood levels, decreasing metoprolol's cardioselectivity .\nIn comparison to conventional metoprolol, the plasma metoprolol levels following administration of metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets are characterized by lower peaks, longer time to peak and significantly lower peak to trough variation. The peak plasma levels following once-daily administration of metoprolol succinate extended-release tablet average one-fourth to one-half the peak plasma levels obtained following a corresponding dose of conventional metoprolol, administered once daily or in divided doses. At steady state the average bioavailability of metoprolol following administration of metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets, across the dosage range of 50 to 400 mg once daily, was 77% relative to the corresponding single or divided doses of conventional metoprolol. Nevertheless, over the 24-hour dosing interval, β1-blockade is comparable and dose-related . The bioavailability of metoprolol shows a dose-related, although not directly proportional, increase with dose and is not significantly affected by food following metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets administration.\nPediatrics: The pharmacokinetic profile of metoprolol succinate extended-release tablet was studied in 120 pediatric hypertensive patients (6-17 years of age) receiving doses ranging from 12.5 to 200 mg once daily. The pharmacokinetics of metoprolol were similar to those described previously in adults. Age, gender, race, and ideal body weight had no significant effects on metoprolol pharmacokinetics. Metoprolol apparent oral clearance (CL/F) increased linearly with body weight. Metoprolol pharmacokinetics have not been investigated in patients < 6 years of age.\n\n# NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY\nLong-term studies in animals have been conducted to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of metoprolol tartrate. In 2-year studies in rats at three oral dosage levels of up to 800 mg/kg/day (41 times, on a mg/m2 basis, the daily dose of 200 mg for a 60-kg patient), there was no increase in the development of spontaneously occurring benign or malignant neoplasms of any type. The only histologic changes that appeared to be drug related were an increased incidence of generally mild focal accumulation of foamy macrophages in pulmonary alveoli and a slight increase in biliary hyperplasia. In a 21-month study in Swiss albino mice at three oral dosage levels of up to 750 mg/kg/day (18 times, on a mg/m2 basis, the daily dose of 200 mg for a 60-kg patient), benign lung tumors (small adenomas) occurred more frequently in female mice receiving the highest dose than in untreated control animals. There was no increase in malignant or total (benign plus malignant) lung tumors, nor in the overall incidence of tumors or malignant tumors. This 21-month study was repeated in CD-1 mice, and no statistically or biologically significant differences were observed between treated and control mice of either sex for any type of tumor.\nAll genotoxicity tests performed on metoprolol tartrate (a dominant lethal study in mice, chromosome studies in somatic cells, aSalmonella/mammalian-microsome mutagenicity test, and a nucleus anomaly test in somatic interphase nuclei) and metoprolol succinate (aSalmonella/mammalian-microsome mutagenicity test) were negative.\nNo evidence of impaired fertility due to metoprolol tartrate was observed in a study performed in rats at doses up to 22 times, on a mg/m2basis, the daily dose of 200 mg in a 60-kg patient.\n\n# CLINICAL STUDIES\nIn five controlled studies in normal healthy subjects, the same daily doses of metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets and immediate release metoprolol were compared in terms of the extent and duration of beta1-blockade produced. Both formulations were given in a dose range equivalent to 100-400 mg of immediate release metoprolol per day. In these studies, metoprolol succinate extended-release tablet was administered once a day and immediate release metoprolol was administered once to four times a day. A sixth controlled study compared the beta1-blocking effects of a 50 mg daily dose of the two formulations. In each study, beta1-blockade was expressed as the percent change from baseline in exercise heart rate following standardized submaximal exercise tolerance tests at steady state. Metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets administered once a day, and immediate release metoprolol administered once to four times a day, provided comparable total beta1-blockade over 24 hours (area under the beta1-blockade versus time curve) in the dose range 100-400 mg. At a dosage of 50 mg once daily, metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets produced significantly higher total beta1-blockade over 24 hours than immediate release metoprolol. For metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets, the percent reduction in exercise heart rate was relatively stable throughout the entire dosage interval and the level of beta1-blockade increased with increasing doses from 50 to 300 mg daily. The effects at peak/trough (ie, at 24-hours post-dosing) were: 14/9, 16/10, 24/14, 27/22 and 27/20% reduction in exercise heart rate for doses of 50, 100, 200, 300 and 400 mg metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets once a day, respectively. In contrast to metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets, immediate release metoprolol given at a dose of 50-100 mg once a day produced a significantly larger peak effect on exercise tachycardia, but the effect was not evident at 24 hours. To match the peak to trough ratio obtained with metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets over the dosing range of 200 to 400 mg, a t.i.d. to q.i.d. divided dosing regimen was required for immediate release metoprolol. A controlled cross-over study in heart failure patients compared the plasma concentrations and beta1-blocking effects of 50 mg immediate release metoprolol administered t.i.d., 100 mg and 200 mg metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets once daily. A 50 mg dose of immediate release metoprolol t.i.d. produced a peak plasma level of metoprolol similar to the peak level observed with 200 mg of metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets. A 200 mg dose of metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets produced a larger effect on suppression of exercise-induced and Holter-monitored heart rate over 24 hours compared to 50 mg t.i.d. of immediate release metoprolol.\nIn a double-blind study, 1092 patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension were randomized to once daily metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets (25, 100, or 400 mg), PLENDIL® (felodipine extended release tablets), the combination, or placebo. After 9 weeks, metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets alone decreased sitting blood pressure by 6-8/4-7 mmHg (placebo-corrected change from baseline) at 24 hours post-dose. The combination of metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets with PLENDIL has greater effects on blood pressure.\nIn controlled clinical studies, an immediate release dosage form of metoprolol was an effective antihypertensive agent when used alone or as concomitant therapy with thiazide-type diuretics at dosages of 100-450 mg daily. Metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets, in dosages of 100 to 400 mg once daily, produces similar β1-blockade as conventional metoprolol tablets administered two to four times daily. In addition, metoprolol succinate extended-release tablet administered at a dose of 50 mg once daily lowered blood pressure 24-hours post-dosing in placebo-controlled studies. In controlled, comparative, clinical studies, immediate release metoprolol appeared comparable as an antihypertensive agent to propranolol, methyldopa, and thiazide-type diuretics, and affected both supine and standing blood pressure. Because of variable plasma levels attained with a given dose and lack of a consistent relationship of antihypertensive activity to drug plasma concentration, selection of proper dosage requires individual titration.\nBy blocking catecholamine-induced increases in heart rate, in velocity and extent of myocardial contraction, and in blood pressure, metoprolol reduces the oxygen requirements of the heart at any given level of effort, thus making it useful in the long-term management of angina pectoris.\nIn controlled clinical trials, an immediate release formulation of metoprolol has been shown to be an effective antianginal agent, reducing the number of angina attacks and increasing exercise tolerance. The dosage used in these studies ranged from 100 to 400 mg daily. Metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets, in dosages of 100 to 400 mg once daily, has been shown to possess beta-blockade similar to conventional metoprolol tablets administered two to four times daily.\nMERIT-HF was a double-blind, placebo-controlled study of metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets conducted in 14 countries including the US. It randomized 3991 patients (1990 to metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets) with ejection fraction ≤0.40 and NYHA Class II-IV heart failure attributable to ischemia, hypertension, or cardiomyopathy. The protocol excluded patients with contraindications to beta-blocker use, those expected to undergo heart surgery, and those within 28 days of myocardial infarction or unstable angina. The primary endpoints of the trial were (1) all-cause mortality plus all-cause hospitalization (time to first event) and (2) all-cause mortality. Patients were stabilized on optimal concomitant therapy for heart failure, including diuretics, ACE inhibitors, cardiac glycosides, and nitrates. At randomization, 41% of patients were NYHA Class II; 55% NYHA Class III; 65% of patients had heart failure attributed to ischemic heart disease; 44% had a history of hypertension; 25% had diabetes mellitus; 48% had a history of myocardial infarction. Among patients in the trial, 90% were on diuretics, 89% were on ACE inhibitors, 64% were on digitalis, 27% were on a lipid-lowering agent, 37% were on an oral anticoagulant, and the mean ejection fraction was 0.28. The mean duration of follow-up was one year. At the end of the study, the mean daily dose of metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets was 159 mg.\nThe trial was terminated early for a statistically significant reduction in all-cause mortality (34%, nominal p= 0.00009). The risk of all-cause mortality plus all-cause hospitalization was reduced by 19% (p= 0.00012). The trial also showed improvements in heart failure-related mortality and heart failure-related hospitalizations, and NYHA functional class.\nThe table below shows the principal results for the overall study population. The figure below illustrates principal results for a wide variety of subgroup comparisons, including US vs. non-US populations (the latter of which was not pre-specified). The combined endpoints of all-cause mortality plus all-cause hospitalization and of mortality plus heart failure hospitalization showed consistent effects in the overall study population and the subgroups, including women and the US population. However, in the US subgroup (n=1071) and women (n=898), overall mortality and cardiovascular mortality appeared less affected. Analyses of female and US patients were carried out because they each represented about 25% of the overall population. Nonetheless, subgroup analyses can be difficult to interpret and it is not known whether these represent true differences or chance effects.\n\n# HOW SUPPLIED\nTablets containing metoprolol succinate equivalent to the indicated weight of metoprolol tartrate, USP, are white, biconvex, film-coated, and scored. name=\"ib13da1b2-ef46-44a7-887b-3227715a2213\"\n- The 25 mg tablet is scored on both sides.\nStore at 20°-25°C (68°-77°F); .\n\n# INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS\nAdvise patients to take metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets regularly and continuously, as directed, preferably with or immediately following meals.

Please read our full disclaimer here.\n\n# Black Box Warning\n\n# Overview\nMexiletine is an antiarrhythmic that is FDA approved for the {{{indicationType}}} of ventricular arrhythmias, such as sustained ventricular tachycardia. There is a Black Box Warning for this drug as shown here.  Common adverse reactions include heartburn, nausea, vomiting, coordination problem, dizziness, lightheadedness, tremor, blurred vision, visual disturbance, and anxiety.\n\n# Adult Indications and Dosage\n\n## FDA-Labeled Indications and Dosage (Adult)\n- Loading Dose\n- When rapid control of ventricular arrhythmia is essential, an initial loading dose of 400 mg of mexiletine hydrochloride may be administered, followed by a 200 mg dose in eight hours. Onset of therapeutic effect is usually observed within 30 minutes to two hours.\n- Q12H Dosage Schedule\n- Some patients responding to mexiletine may be transferred to a 12 hour dosage schedule to improve convenience and compliance. If adequate suppression is achieved on a mexiletine hydrochloride dose of 300 mg or less every eight hours, the same total daily dose may be given in divided doses every 12 hours while carefully monitoring the degree of suppression of ventricular ectopy. This dose may be adjusted up to a maximum of 450 mg every 12 hours to achieve the desired response.\n- Transferring to Mexiletine Hydrochloride\n- The following dosage schedule, based on theoretical considerations rather than experimental data, is suggested for transferring patients from other Class I oral antiarrhythmic agents to mexiletine: mexiletine hydrochloride treatment may be initiated with a 200 mg dose, and titrated to response as described above, 6 to 12 hours after the last dose of quinidine sulfate, 3 to 6 hours after the last dose of procainamide, 6 to 12 hours after the last dose of disopryramide or 8 to 12 hours after the last dose of tocainide.\n- In patients in whom withdrawal of the previous antiarrhythmic agent is likely to produce life-threatening arrhythmias, hospitalization of the patient is recommended.\n- When transferring from lidocaine to mexiletine, the lidocaine infusion should be stopped when the first oral dose of mexiletine hydrochloride is administered. The infusion line should be left open until suppression of the arrhythmia appears to be satisfactorily maintained. Consideration should be given to the similarity of the adverse effects of lidocaine and mexiletine and the possibility that they may be additive.\n- Dosing Information\n- The dosage of mexiletine hydrochloride must be individualized on the basis of response and tolerance, both of which are dose-related. Administration with food or antacid is recommended. Initiate mexiletine therapy with 200 mg every eight hours when rapid control of arrhythmia is not essential. A minimum of two to three days between dose adjustments is recommended. Dose may be adjusted in 50 or 100 mg increments up or down.\n- As with any antiarrhythmic drug, clinical and electrocardiographic evaluation (including Holter monitoring if necessary for evaluation) are needed to determine whether the desired antiarrhythmic effect has been obtained and to guide titration and dose adjustment.\n- Satisfactory control can be achieved in most patients by 200 to 300 mg given every eight hours with food or antacid. If satisfactory response has not been achieved at 300 mg q8h, and the patient tolerates mexiletine well, a dose of 400 mg q8h may be tried. As the severity of CNS side effects increases with total daily dose, the dose should not exceed 1200 mg/day.\n- In general, patients with renal failure will require the usual doses of mexiletine hydrochloride. Patients with severe liver disease, however, may require lower doses and must be monitored closely. Similarly, marked right-sided congestive heart failure can reduce hepatic metabolism and reduce the needed dose. Plasma level may also be affected by certain concomitant drugs\n\n## Off-Label Use and Dosage (Adult)\n\n### Guideline-Supported Use\nThere is limited information regarding Off-Label Guideline-Supported Use of Mexiletine in adult patients.\n\n### Non–Guideline-Supported Use\nThere is limited information regarding Off-Label Non–Guideline-Supported Use of Mexiletine in adult patients.\n\n# Pediatric Indications and Dosage\n\n## FDA-Labeled Indications and Dosage (Pediatric)\n- Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.\n\n## Off-Label Use and Dosage (Pediatric)\n\n### Guideline-Supported Use\nThere is limited information regarding Off-Label Guideline-Supported Use of Mexiletine in pediatric patients.\n\n### Non–Guideline-Supported Use\n- Dosing Information\n- 1.4 to 5 mg/kg (mean 3.3 mg/kg) every 8 hours\n\n# Contraindications\n- Mexiletine hydrochloride capsules are contraindicated in the presence of cardiogenic shock or pre-existing second-or third-degree AV block (if no pacemaker is present).\n\n# Warnings\n\n### Precautions\n- General\n- If a ventricular pacemaker is operative, patients with second or third degree heart block may be treated with mexiletine hydrochloride if continuously monitored. A limited number of patients (45 of 475 in controlled clinical trials) with pre-existing first degree AV block were treated with mexiletine; none of these patients developed second or third degree AV block. Caution should be exercised when it is used in such patients or in patients with pre-existing sinus node dysfunction or intraventricular conduction abnormalities.\n- Like other antiarrhythmics mexiletine hydrochloride can cause worsening of arrhythmias. This has been uncommon in patients with less serious arrhythmias (frequent premature beats or nonsustained ventricular tachycardia), but is of greater concern in patients with life-threatening arrhythmias such as sustained ventricular tachycardia. In patients with such arrhythmias subjected to programmed electrical stimulation or to exercise provocation, 10 to 15% of patients had exacerbation of the arrhythmia, a rate not greater than that of other agents.\n- Mexiletine should be used with caution in patients with hypotension and severe congestive heart failure because of the potential for aggravating these conditions.\n- Since mexiletine is metabolized in the liver, and hepatic impairment has been reported to prolong the elimination half-life of mexiletine, patients with liver disease should be followed carefully while receiving mexiletine. The same caution should be observed in patients with hepatic dysfunction secondary to congestive heart failure.\n- Concurrent drug therapy or dietary regimens which may markedly alter urinary pH should be avoided during mexiletine hydrochloride therapy. The minor fluctuations in urinary pH associated with normal diet do not affect the excretion of mexiletine.\n- SGOT Elevation and Liver Injury\n- In three month controlled trials, elevations of SGOT greater than three times the upper limit of normal occurred in about 1% of both mexiletine-treated and control patients. Approximately 2% of patients in the mexiletine compassionate use program had elevations of SGOT greater than or equal to three times the upper limit of normal. These elevations frequently occurred in association with identifiable clinical events and therapeutic measures such as congestive heart failure, acute myocardial infarction, blood transfusions and other medications. These elevations were often asymptomatic and transient, usually not associated with elevated bilirubin levels and usually did not require discontinuation of therapy. Marked elevations of SGOT (> 1000 U/L) were seen before death in four patients with end-stage cardiac disease (severe congestive heart failure, cardiogenic shock).\n- Rare instances of severe liver injury, including hepatic necrosis, have been reported in association with mexiletine treatment. It is recommended that patients in whom an abnormal liver test has occurred, or who have signs of symptoms suggesting liver dysfunction, be carefully evaluated. If persistent or worsening elevation of hepatic enzymes is detected, consideration should be given to discontinuing therapy.\n- Blood Dyscrasias\n- Among 10,867 patients treated with mexiletine in the compassionate use program, marked leukopenia (neutrophils less than 1000/mm3) or agranulocytosis were seen in 0.06% and milder depressions of leukocytes were seen in 0.08%, and thrombocytopenia was observed in 0.16%. Many of these patients were seriously ill and receiving concomitant medications with known hematologic adverse effects. Rechallenge with mexiletine in several cases was negative. Marked leukopenia or agranulocytosis did not occur in any patient receiving mexiletine alone; five of the six cases of agranulocytosis were associated with procainamide (sustained release preparations in four) and one with vinblastine. If significant hematologic changes are observed, the patient should be carefully evaluated, and, if warranted, mexiletine should be discontinued. Blood counts usually return to normal within a month of discontinuation.\n- Convulsions (seizures) did not occur in mexiletine controlled clinical trials. In the compassionate use program, convulsions were reported in about 2 of 1000 patients. Twenty-eight percent of these patients discontinued therapy. Convulsions were reported in patients with and without a prior history of seizures. Mexiletine should be used with caution in patients with known seizure disorder.\n\n# Adverse Reactions\n\n## Clinical Trials Experience\n- Mexiletine hydrochloride commonly produces reversible gastrointestinal and nervous system adverse reactions but is otherwise well tolerated. Mexiletine has been evaluated in 483 patients in one month and three month controlled studies and in over 10,000 patients in a large compassionate use program. Dosages in the controlled studies ranged from 600 to 1200 mg/day; some patients (8%) in the compassionate use program were treated with higher daily doses (1600 to 3200 mg/day). In the three month controlled trials comparing mexiletine to quinidine, procainamide and disopyramide, the most frequent adverse reactions were upper gastrointestinal distress (41%), lightheadedness (10.5%), tremor (12.6%) and coordination difficulties (10.2%). Similar frequency and incidence were observed in the one month placebo-controlled trial. Although these reactions were generally not serious, and were dose-related and reversible with a reduction in dosage, by taking the drug with food or antacid or by therapy discontinuation, they led to therapy discontinuation in 40% of patients in the controlled trials. Table 1 presents the adverse events reported in the one-month placebo-controlled trial.\n- Table 2 presents the adverse reactions occurring in one percent or more of patients in the three month controlled studies.\n- Less than 1%: Syncope, edema, hot flashes, hypertension, short-term memory loss, loss of consciousness, other psychological changes, diaphoresis, urinary hesitancy/retention, malaise, impotence/decreased libido, pharyngitis, and congestive heart failure.\n- An additional group of over 10,000 patients has been treated in a program allowing administration of mexiletine hydrochloride under compassionate use circumstances. These patients were seriously ill with the large majority on multiple drug therapy. Twenty-four percent of the patients continued in the program for one year or longer. Adverse reactions leading to therapy discontinuation occurred in 15 percent of patients (usually upper gastrointestinal system or nervous system effects). In general, the more common adverse reactions were similar to those in the controlled trials. Less common adverse events possibly related to mexiletine use include:\nSyncope and hypotension, each about 6 in 1000; bradycardia, about 4 in 1000; angina/angina-like pain, about 3 in 1000; edema, atrioventricular block/conduction disturbances and hot flashes, each about 2 in 1000; atrial arrhythmias, hypertension and cardiogenic shock, each about 1 in 1000.\nDysphagia, about 2 in 1000; peptic ulcer, about 8 in 10,000; upper gastrointestinal bleeding, about 7 in 10,000; esophageal ulceration, about 1 in 10,000. Rare cases of severe hepatitis/acute hepatic necrosis.\nBlood dyscrasias were not seen in the controlled trials but did occur among 10,867 patients treated with mexiletine in the compassionate use program.\nMyelofibrosis was reported in two patients in the compassionate use program; one was receiving long-term thiotepa therapy and the other had pretreatment myeloid abnormalities.\nIn postmarketing experience, there have been isolated, spontaneous reports of pulmonary changes including pulmonary infiltration and pulmonary fibrosis during mexiletine therapy with or without other drugs or diseases that are known to produce pulmonary toxicity. A causal relationship to mexiletine therapy has not been established. In addition, there have been isolated reports of drowsiness, nystagmus, ataxia, dyspepsia, hypersensitivity reaction, and exacerbation of congestive heart failure in patients with pre-existing compromised ventricular function. There have been rare reports of pancreatitis associated with mexiletine treatment.\nShort-term memory loss, about 9 in 1000 patients; hallucinations and other psychological changes, each about 3 in 1000; psychosis and convulsions/seizures, each about 2 in 1000; loss of consciousness, about 6 in 10,000.\nRare cases of exfoliative dermatitis and Stevens-Johnson syndrome with mexiletine treatment have been reported.\nAbnormal liver function tests, about 5 in 1000; positive ANA and thrombocytopenia, each about 2 in 1000; leukopenia (including neutropenia and agranulocytosis), about 1 in 1000; myelofibrosis, about 2 in 10,000 patients.\nDiaphoresis, about 6 in 1000; altered taste, about 5 in 1000; salivary changes, hair loss and impotence/decreased libido, each about 4 in 1000; malaise, about 3 in 1000; urinary hesitancy/retention, each about 2 in 1000; hiccups, dry skin, laryngeal and pharyngeal changes and changes in oral mucous membranes, each about 1 in 1000; SLE syndrome, about 4 in 10,000.\n\n## Postmarketing Experience\nThere is limited information regarding Postmarketing Experience of Mexiletine in the drug label.\n\n# Drug Interactions\n- Since mexiletine hydrochloride is a substrate for the metabolic pathways involving CYP2D6 and CYP1A2 enzymes, inhibition or induction of either of these enzymes would be expected to alter mexiletine plasma concentrations. In a formal, single-dose interaction study (n = 6 males) the clearance of mexiletine was decreased by 38% following the coadministration of fluvoxamine, an inhibitor of CYP1A2. In another formal study (n = 8 extensive and n = 7 poor metabolizers of CYP2D6), coadministration of propafenone did not alter the kinetics of mexiletine in the poor CYP2D6 metabolizer group. However, the metabolic clearance of mexiletine in the extensive metabolizer phenotype decreased by about 70% making the poor and extensive metabolizer groups indistinguishable. In this crossover steady state study, the pharmacokinetics of propafenone were unaffected in either phenotype by the coadministration of mexiletine. Addition of mexiletine to propafenone did not lead to further electrocardiographic parameters changes of QRS, QTc, RR, and PR intervals than propafenone alone. When concomitant administration of either of these two drugs is initiated, the dose of mexiletine should be slowly titrated to desired effect.\n- In a large compassionate use program mexiletine has been used concurrently with commonly employed antianginal, antihypertensive, and anticoagulant drugs without observed interactions. A variety of antiarrhythmics such as quinidine or propranolol were also added, sometimes with improved control of ventricular ectopy. When phenytoin or other hepatic enzyme inducers such as rifampin and phenobarbital have been taken concurrently with mexiletine, lowered mexiletine plasma levels have been reported. Monitoring of mexiletine plasma levels is recommended during such concurrent use to avoid ineffective therapy.\n- In a formal study, benzodiazepines were shown not to affect mexiletine plasma concentrations. ECG intervals (PR, QRS, and QT) were not affected by concurrent mexiletine and digoxin, diuretics, or propranolol.\n- Concurrent administration of cimetidine and mexiletine has been reported to increase, decrease, or leave unchanged mexiletine plasma levels; therefore patients should be followed carefully during concurrent therapy.\n- Mexiletine does not alter serum digoxin levels but magnesium-aluminum hydroxide, when used to treat gastrointestinal symptoms due to mexiletine, has been reported to lower serum digoxin levels.\n- Concurrent use of mexiletine and theophylline may lead to increased plasma theophylline levels. One controlled study in eight normal subjects showed a 72% mean increase (range 35 to 136%) in plasma theophylline levels. This increase was observed at the first test point which was the second day after starting mexiletine. Theophylline plasma levels returned to pre-mexiletine values within 48 hours after discontinuing mexiletine. If mexiletine and theophylline are to be used concurrently, theophylline blood levels should be monitored, particularly when the mexiletine dose is changed. An appropriate adjustment in theophylline dose should be considered.\n- Additionally, in one controlled study in five normal subjects and seven patients, the clearance of caffeine was decreased 50% following the administration of mexiletine.\n\n# Use in Specific Populations\n\n### Pregnancy\nPregnancy Category (FDA):\n- Pregnancy Category C\n- Reproduction studies performed with mexiletine in rats, mice and rabbits at doses up to four times the maximum human oral dose (24 mg/kg in a 50 kg patient) revealed no evidence of teratogenicity or impaired fertility but did show an increase in fetal resorption. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women; this drug should be used in pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.\nPregnancy Category (AUS):\n- Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) Pregnancy Category\nThere is no Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) guidance on usage of Mexiletine in women who are pregnant.\n\n### Labor and Delivery\nThere is no FDA guidance on use of Mexiletine during labor and delivery.\n\n### Nursing Mothers\n- Mexiletine appears in human milk in concentrations similar to those observed in plasma. Therefore, if the use of mexiletine hydrochloride is deemed essential, an alternative method of infant feeding should be considered.\n\n### Pediatric Use\n- Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.\n\n### Geriatic Use\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Mexiletine with respect to geriatric patients.\n\n### Gender\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Mexiletine with respect to specific gender populations.\n\n### Race\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Mexiletine with respect to specific racial populations.\n\n### Renal Impairment\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Mexiletine in patients with renal impairment.\n\n### Hepatic Impairment\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Mexiletine in patients with hepatic impairment.\n\n### Females of Reproductive Potential and Males\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Mexiletine in women of reproductive potentials and males.\n\n### Immunocompromised Patients\nThere is no FDA guidance one the use of Mexiletine in patients who are immunocompromised.\n\n# Administration and Monitoring\n\n### Administration\n- Oral\n\n### Monitoring\n- As with any antiarrhythmic drug, clinical and electrocardiographic evaluation (including Holter monitoring if necessary for evaluation) are needed to determine whether the desired antiarrhythmic effect has been obtained and to guide titration and dose adjustment.\n\n# IV Compatibility\nThere is limited information regarding IV Compatibility of Mexiletine in the drug label.\n\n# Overdosage\n\n## Acute Overdose\n\n### Signs and Symptoms\n- Clinical findings associated with mexiletine overdosage have included drowsiness, confusion, nausea, hypotension, sinus bradycardia, paresthesia, seizures, bundle branch block, AV heart block, asystole, ventricular tachyarrythmia, including ventricular fibrillation, cardiovascular collapse and coma. The lowest known dose in a fatality case was 4.4 g with postmortem serum mexiletine level of 34 to 37 mcg/mL (Jequier P. et. al., Lancet 1976: 1 (7956): 429). Patients have recovered from ingestion of 4 g to 18 g of mexiletine (Frank S. E. et. al., Am J Emerg Med 1991: 9:43-48).\n\n### Management\n- In postmarketing experience, there have been isolated, spontaneous reports of pulmonary changes including pulmonary infiltration and pulmonary fibrosis during mexiletine therapy with or without other drugs or diseases that are known to produce pulmonary toxicity. A causal relationship to mexiletine therapy has not been established. In addition, there have been isolated reports of drowsiness, nystagmus, ataxia, dyspepsia, hypersensitivity reaction, and exacerbation of congestive heart failure in patients with pre-existing compromised ventricular function. There have been rare reports of pancreatitis associated with mexiletine treatment.\n\n## Chronic Overdose\nThere is limited information regarding Chronic Overdose of Mexiletine in the drug label.\n\n# Pharmacology\n\n## Mechanism of Action\n- Mexiletine hydrochloride is a local anesthetic, antiarrhythmic agent, structurally similar to lidocaine, but orally active. In animal studies, mexiletine has been shown to be effective in the suppression of induced ventricular arrhythmias, including those induced by glycoside toxicity and coronary artery ligation. Mexiletine, like lidocaine, inhibits the inward sodium current, thus reducing the rate of rise of the action potential, Phase 0. Mexiletine decreased the effective refractory period (ERP) in Purkinje fibers. The decrease in ERP was of lesser magnitude than the decrease in action potential duration (APD), with a resulting increase in the ERP/APD ratio.\n- Electrophysiology in Man\n- Mexiletine is a Class 1B antiarrhythmic compound with electrophysiologic properties in man similar to those of lidocaine, but dissimilar from quinidine, procainamide, and disopyramide.\n- In patients with normal conduction systems, mexiletine has a minimal effect on cardiac impulse generation and propagation. In clinical trials, no development of second-degree or third degree AV block was observed. Mexiletine did not prolong ventricular depolarization (QRS duration) or repolarization (QT intervals) as measured by electrocardiography. Theoretically, therefore, mexiletine may be useful in the treatment of ventricular arrhythmias associated with a prolonged QT interval.\n- In patients with pre-existing conduction defects, depression of the sinus rate, prolongation of sinus node recovery time, decreased conduction velocity and increased effective refractory period of the intraventricular conduction system have occasionally been observed.\n- The antiarrhythmic effect of mexiletine has been established in controlled comparative trials against placebo, quinidine, procainamide and disopyramide. Mexiletine hydrochloride, at doses of 200 to 400 mg q8h, produced a significant reduction of ventricular premature beats, paired beats, and episodes of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia compared to placebo and was similar in effectiveness to the active agents. Among all patients entered into the studies, about 30% in each treatment group had a 70% or greater reduction in PVC count and about 40% failed to complete the 3 month studies because of adverse effects. Follow-up of patients from the controlled trials has demonstrated continued effectiveness of mexiletine in long-term use.\n- Hemodynamics\n- Hemodynamic studies in a limited number of patients, with normal or abnormal myocardial function, following oral administration of mexiletine hydrochloride, have shown small, usually not statistically significant, decreases in cardiac output and increases in systemic vascular resistance, but no significant negative inotropic effect. Blood pressure and pulse rate remain essentially unchanged. Mild depression of myocardial function, similar to that produced by lidocaine, has occasionally been observed following intravenous mexiletine therapy in patients with cardiac disease.\n\n## Structure\n- Mexiletine hydrochloride is an orally active antiarrhythmic agent. It is a white to off-white crystalline powder with slightly bitter taste, freely soluble in water and in alcohol. Mexiletine hydrochloride has a pKa of 9.2. The chemical name of mexiletine hydrochloride is 1-methyl-2-(2,6-xylyloxy)ethylamine hydrochloride and its structural formula is:\n- Each capsule for oral administration, contains 150 mg, 200 mg, or 250 mg of mexiletine hydrochloride. 100 mg of mexiletine hydrochloride is equivalent to 83.31 mg of mexiletine base. In addition, each capsule contains the following excipients: colloidal silicon dioxide, magnesium stearate and pregelatinized starch. The capsule shell contains: FD&C Yellow #6, gelatin and titanium dioxide. The 150 mg capsule also contains: D&C Red #28 and FD&C Blue #1 and the 250 mg capsule also contains: D&C Yellow #10 and FD&C Blue #1. The imprinting ink contains: ammonium hydroxide, black iron oxide, D&C Yellow #10, ethyl alcohol, FD&C Blue #1, FD&C Blue #2, FD&C Red #40, isopropyl alcohol, n-butyl alcohol, propylene glycol and shellac.\n\n## Pharmacodynamics\nThere is limited information regarding Pharmacodynamics of Mexiletine in the drug label.\n\n## Pharmacokinetics\n- Mexiletine is well absorbed (~90%) from the gastrointestinal tract. Unlike lidocaine, its first-pass metabolism is low. Peak blood levels are reached in two to three hours. In normal subjects, the plasma elimination half-life of mexiletine is approximately 10 to 12 hours. It is 50 to 60% bound to plasma protein, with a volume of distribution of 5 to 7 liters/kg. Mexiletine is mainly metabolized in the liver, the primary pathway being CYP2D6 metabolism, although it is also a substrate for CYP1A2. With involvement of CYP2D6, there can be either poor or extensive metabolizer phenotypes. Since approximately 90% of mexiletine hydrochloride is metabolized in the liver into inactive metabolites, pathological changes in the liver can restrict hepatic clearance of mexiletine hydrochloride and its metabolites. The metabolic degradation proceeds via various pathways including aromatic and aliphatic hydroxylation, dealkylation, deamination and N-oxidation. Several of the resulting metabolites are submitted to further conjugation with glucuronic acid (phase II metabolism); among these are the major metabolites p-hydroxymexiletine, hydroxy-methylmexiletine and N-hydroxy-mexiletine. Approximately 10% is excreted unchanged by the kidney. While urinary pH does not normally have much influence on elimination, marked changes in urinary pH influence the rate of excretion: acidification accelerates excretion, while alkalinization retards it.\n- Several metabolites of mexiletine have shown minimal antiarrhythmics activity in animal models. The most active is the minor metabolite N-methylmexiletine, which is less than 20% as potent as mexiletine. The urinary excretion of N-methylmexiletine in man is less than 0.5%. Thus the therapeutic activity of mexiletine is due to the parent compound.\n- Hepatic impairment prolongs the elimination half-life of mexiletine. In eight patients with moderate to severe liver disease, the mean half-life was approximately 25 hours.\n- Consistent with the limited renal elimination of mexiletine, little change in the half-life has been detected in patients with reduced renal function. In eight patients with creatinine clearance less than 10 mL/min, the mean plasma elimination half-life was 15.7 hours; in seven patients with creatinine clearance between 11 to 40 mL/min, the mean half-life was 13.4 hours.\n- The absorption rate of mexiletine is reduced in clinical situations such as acute myocardial infarction in which gastric emptying time is increased. Narcotics, atropine and magnesium-aluminum hydroxide have also been reported to slow the absorption of mexiletine. Metoclopramide has been reported to accelerate absorption.\n- Mexiletine plasma levels of at least 0.5 mcg/mL are generally required for therapeutic response. An increase in the frequency of central nervous system adverse effects has been observed when plasma levels exceed 2.0 mcg/mL. Thus the therapeutic range is approximately 0.5 to 2.0 mcg/mL. Plasma levels within the therapeutic range can be attained with either three times daily or twice daily dosing but peak to trough differences are greater with the latter regimen, creating the possibility of adverse effects at peak and arrhythmic escape at trough. Nevertheless, some patients may be transferred successfully to the twice daily regimen.\n\n## Nonclinical Toxicology\n- Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility\n- Studies of carcinogenesis in rats (24 months) and mice (18 months) did not demonstrate any tumorigenic potential. Mexiletine was found to be non-mutagenic in the Ames test. Mexiletine did not impair fertility in the rat.\n\n# Clinical Studies\nThere is limited information regarding Clinical Studies of Mexiletine in the drug label.\n\n# How Supplied\n- Mexiletine hydrochloride capsules USP, 150 mg are white granular powder in a hard gelatin capsule with an opaque tan cap and an opaque orange body, imprinted with N on one side and 739 and 150 on the other in black ink.

{"guideline_text": "Cysteinyl leukotriene receptor 2\nCysteinyl leukotriene receptor 2, also termed CYSLTR2, is a receptor for cysteinyl leukotrienes (LT) (see leukotrienes#Cysteinyl leukotrienes). CYSLTR2, by binding these cysteinyl LTs (CysLTs; viz, LTC4, LTD4, and to a much lesser extent, LTE4) contributes to mediating various allergic and hypersensitivity reactions in humans. However, the first discovered receptor for these CsLTs, cysteinyl leukotriene receptor 1 (CysLTR1), appears to play the major role in mediating these reactions.\n\n# Gene\nThe human CysLTR2 gene maps to the long arm of chromosome 13 at position 13q14, a chromosomal region that has long been linked to asthma and other allergic diseases.  The gene consists of four exons with all introns located in the genes' 5' UTR region and the entire coding region located in the last exon. 'CysLTR2 encodes a protein composed of 347 amino acids and shows only modest similarity to the CysLTR1 gene in that its protein shares only 31% amino acid identity with the CysLTR1 protein.\n\n# Receptor\nCySLTR2 mRNA is co-expressed along with CysLRR1 in human blood eosinophils and platelets, and tissue mast cells, macrophages, airway epithelial cells, and vascular endothelial cells. It is also expressed without CysLTR1 throughout the heart, including Purkinje cells, adrenal gland, and brain as well as some vascular endothelial, airway epithelial, and smooth muscle cells.\nCysLTR2, similar to CysLTR1, is a G protein–coupled receptor that links to and when bound to its CysLT ligands activates the Gq alpha subunit and/or Ga subunit of its coupled G protein, depending or the cell type. Acting through these G proteins and their subunits, ligand-bound CysLTR1 activates a series of pathways that lead to cell function (see Gq alpha subunit#function and Ga subunit#function for details); the order of potency of the cysLTs in stimulating CysLTR2 is LTD4=LTC4>LTE4 with LTE4 probably lacking sufficient potency to have much activity that operates through CysLTR1 in vivo. By comparison, the stimulating potencies of these CysLTs for CysLTR1 is LTD4>LTC4>LTE4 with LTD4 showing 10-fold greater potency on CysLTR1 than CysLTR2. Perhaps related to this difference in CysLT sensitivities, cells co-expressing CysLTR2 and CysLTR1 may exhibit lower sensitivity to LTD4 than do cells expressing only CysLTR1; in consequence, CysLTR2 has been suggested to dampen CysLTR1's activities.\nIn addition to CysLTR1, GPR99 (also termed the oxoglutarate receptor or, sometimes, CysLTR3) appears to be an important receptor for CysLTs, particularly for LTE4: the CystLTs show relative potencies of LTE4>LTC4>LTD4 in stimulating GPR99-bearing cells and GPR99-deficient mice exhibit a dose-dependent loss of vascular permeability responses in skin to LTE4 but not to LTC4 or LTD4.\nOther studies on model cells for allergy have defined GPR17 (also termed the uracil nucleotide/cysteinyl leukotriene receptor) as a receptor not only uracil nucleotides but also for CysLTs, with CysLTs having the following potencies LTD4>LTC4>LTE4 in stimulating GPR17-bearing cells. However, recent studies also working with model cells involved in allergy find that GPR17-bearing cells do not respond to these CysLTs (or uracil nucleotides). Rather, they find that: a) cells expressing both CysLTR1 and GPR17 receptors exhibit a marked reduction in binding and responding to LTD4 and b) mice lacking GPR17 are hyper-responsive to igE in a model for passive cutaneous anaphylaxis. The latter studies conclude that GPR17 acts to inhibit CysLTR1. Finally, and in striking contrast to these studies, repeated studies on neural tissues find that Oligodendrocyte progenitor cells express GPR17 and respond through this receptor to LTC4, LTD4, and certain purines (see GPR17#Function).\n\n# CysLTR2 inhibitors\nThere are as yet no selective inhibitors of CysLTR2 that are in clinical use (see Clinical significance section below). However, Gemilukast (ONO-6950) reportedly inhibits both CysLTR1 and CysLTR2. The drug is currently being evaluated in phase II trials for the treatment of asthma.\n\n# CysLTR2 polymorphism\nPolymorphism in the CysLTR2 gene resulting in a single amino acid substitution, M201V (i.e. amino acid methionine changed for valine at the 201 position of CysLTR2 protein) has been negatively associated in Transmission disequilibrium testing with the inheritance of asthma in separate populations of: a) white and African-Americans from 359 families with a high prevalence of asthma in Denmark and Minnesota, USA, and b) 384 families with a high prevalence of asthma from the Genetics of Asthma International Network. The M201V CysLTR2 variant exhibits decreased responsiveness to LTD4 suggesting that this hypo-responsiveness underlies its asthma transmission-protecting effect. A -1220A>C (i.e. nucleotide adenine substituted for cytosine at position 1220 upstream from the transcription start site) gene polymorphism variant in intron III the upstream region of CysLTR2 has been associated significantly with development of asthma in a Japanese population; the impact of this polymorphism on the genes expression or product has not been determined. These results suggest that CYSLTR2 contributes to the etiology and development asthma and that drugs targeting CYSLTR2 may work in a manner that differs from those of CYSLTR1 antagonists.\n\n# Clinical significance\nThe CysLT-induced activation of CysLTR2 induces many of the same in vitro responses of cells involved in allergic reactions as well as the in vivo allergic responses in animal models as that induced by CysLT-induced CysLTR1 (see Cysteinyl leukotriene receptor 1#Receptor. However, CysLT2 requires 10-fold higher concentrations of LTD4, the most potent cysLT for CysLTR1, to activate CysLTR2. Furthermore, the allergic and hypersensitivity responses of humans and animal models are significantly reduced by chronic treatment with Montelukast, Zafirlukast, and Pranlukast, drugs which are selective receptor antagonists of CysLTR1 but not CysLTR2. Models of allergic reactions in Cysltr2-deficient mice as well as in a human mast cell line indicate that mouse Cysltr2 and its human homolog CysLTR2 act to inhibit Cysltr1 and CysLTR1, respectively, and therefore suggest that CysLTR2 may similarly inhibit CysLTR1 in human allergic diseases.  The role of CysLTR2 in the allergic and hypersensitivity diseases of humans must await the development of selective CysLTR2 inhibitors.", "source": "wikidoc", "question": "According to the provided wikidoc recommendation on Cysteinyl leukotriene receptor 2 (CysLTR2), discuss how current evidence regarding CysLTR2 expression, ligand potency, functional interaction with CysLTR1 (and other receptors), and reported polymorphisms should inform (a) the rationale for developing selective CysLTR2-targeted therapies for allergic diseases, and (b) the design and key endpoints of early-phase clinical trials to evaluate such agents."}
{"guideline_text": "Integrin beta 1\nIntegrin beta-1 (ITGB1), also known as CD29, is a cell surface receptor that in humans is encoded by the ITGB1 gene. This integrin associates with integrins alpha 1 and 2 to form integrin complexes which function as collagen receptors. It also forms dimers with integrin alpha 3 to form integrin receptors for netrin 1 and reelin. These and other integrin beta 1 complexes have been historically known as very late activation (VLA) antigens.\nIntegrin beta 1 is expressed as at least four different isoforms. In cardiac muscle and skeletal muscle, the integrin beta-1D isoform is specifically expressed, and localizes to costameres, where it aids in the lateral force transmission from the Z-discs to the extracellular matrix. Abnormal levels of integrin beta-1D have been found in limb girdle muscular dystrophy and polyneuropathy.\n\n# Structure\nIntegrin beta-1 can exist as different isoforms via alternative splicing. Six alternatively spliced variants have been found for this gene which encode five proteins with alternate C-termini. Integrin receptors exist as heterodimers, and greater than 20 different integrin heterodimeric receptors have been described. All integrins, alpha and beta forms, have large extracellular and short intracellular domains. The cytoplasmic domain of integrin beta-1 binds to the actin cytoskeleton. Integrin beta-1 is the most abundant beta-integrin expressed and associates with at least 10 different integrin-alpha subunits.\n\n# Function\nIntegrin family members are membrane receptors involved in cell adhesion and recognition in a variety of processes including embryogenesis, hemostasis, tissue repair, immune response and metastatic diffusion of tumor cells. Integrins link the actin cytoskeleton with the extracellular matrix and they transmit signals bidirectionally between the extracellular matrix and cytoplasmic domains.\nBeta-integrins are primarily responsible for targeting integrin dimers to the appropriate subcellular locations, which in adhesive cells is mainly focal adhesions. Integrin beta-1 mutants lose the ability to target to sites of focal adhesions.\nThree novel isoforms of integrin beta-1 have been identified, termed beta-1B, beta-1C and beta-1D. Integrin beta-1B is transcribed when the proximal 26 amino acids of the cytoplasmic domain in exon 6 are retained and then succeeded by a 12 amino acid stretch from an adjacent intronic region. The integrin beta-1B isoform appears to act as a dominant negative in that it inhibits cell adhesion. A second integrin beta-1 isoform, termed beta-1C, was described to have an additional 48 amino acids appended to the 26 amino acids in the cytoplasmic domain; the function of this isoform was an inhibitory one on DNA synthesis in the G1 phase of the cell cycle.  The third isoform, termed beta-1D, is a striated muscle-specific isoform, which replaces the canonical beta-1A isoform in cardiac and skeletal muscle cells. This isoform is produced from splicing into a novel additional exon between exons 6 and 7. The cytoplasmic domain of integrin beta-1D replaces the distal 21 amino acids (present in integrin beta-1A) with an alternative stretch of 24 amino acids (13 unique).\nIntegrin beta-1D appears to be developmentally regulated during myofibrilogenesis, appearing immediately following the fusion of myoblasts in C2C12 cell with rising levels throughout myofibrillar differentiation. Integrin beta-1D is specifically localized to costameres and intercalated discs of cardiac muscle and costameres, myotendinous junctions and neuromuscular junctions of skeletal muscle, and it appears to function in general like other integrins, as the clustering of beta-1D integrins on the surface of CHO cells resulted in tyrosine phosphorylation of pp125FAK and induced mitogen-activated protein kinase activation.\n\n# Clinical significance\nIn patients with limb girdle muscular dystrophy, type 2C, beta-1D integrin has been shown to be severely reduced in skeletal muscle biopsies, coordinate with a reduction in alpha 7B-integrin and filamin 2.\nIn patients with sensitive-motor polyneuropathy, levels of integrin alpha-7B, integrin beta-1D and agrin were significantly reduced nearly to undetectable levels; and this corresponded with lower mRNA levels.\n\n# Interactions\nCD29 has been shown to interact with\n- ACTN1;\n- CD46,\n- CD9,\n- FHL2,\n- Filamin,\n- FLNB,\n- CD81,\n- GNB2L1,\n- ITGB1BP1,\n- LGALS8,\n- MAP4K4,\n- NME1,\n- PKC alpha,\n- TLN1,\n- TSPAN4, and\n- YWHAB.", "source": "wikidoc", "question": "According to authoritative guidelines, discuss how altered expression of integrin beta‑1 isoforms—particularly the muscle‑specific beta‑1D—should be interpreted when investigating patients with suspected limb‑girdle muscular dystrophy or sensorimotor polyneuropathy, including the molecular basis for isoform-specific function, expected muscle biopsy findings, how detection of reduced beta‑1D (or presence of dominant‑negative beta‑1B/beta‑1C) informs pathogenic understanding, and the diagnostic and clinical implications of these results."}
{"guideline_text": "Infliximab Injection (patient information)\n\n# IMPORTANT WARNING\nInfliximab may decrease your ability to fight infection and increase the risk that you will get a serious or life-threatening infection. Tell your doctor if you have any type of infection now, including minor infections (such as open cuts or sores), infections that come and go (such as cold sores) and chronic infections that do not go away, or if you often get any type of infection such as bladder infections. Also tell your doctor if you are taking medications that suppress the immune system such as azathioprine (Imuran), cancer chemotherapy medications, cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), oral corticosteroids; 6-mercaptopurine (Purinethol); methotrexate (Rheumatrex), sirolimus (Rapamune), and tacrolimus (Prograf). If you experience any of the following symptoms during or shortly after your treatment with infliximab, call your doctor immediately: sore throat; cough; fever; extreme tiredness; flu-like symptoms; warm, red, or painful skin; or other signs of infection.\nInfliximab increases the risk that you will get some types of infections that are most common in certain parts of the United States and the world. Tell your doctor all the places you previously lived and all the places you recently visited or plan to visit while using infliximab.\nYou may be infected with tuberculosis (TB, a type of lung infection) but not have any symptoms of the disease. In this case, infliximab may increase the risk that your infection will become more serious and you will develop symptoms. Your doctor will perform a skin test to see if you have an inactive TB infection. If necessary, your doctor will give you medication to treat this infection before you start using infliximab. Tell your doctor if you have or have ever had TB, or if you have been around someone who has TB.\nKeep all appointments with your doctor. Your doctor will monitor your health carefully to be sure you do not develop a serious infection.\nSome children and young adults with Crohn's disease (a condition in which the body attacks the lining of the digestive tract, causing pain, diarrhea, weight loss, and fever) who used infliximab developed a rare type of cancer called hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma. These patients were also taking azathioprine (Imuran) or 6-mercaptopurine (Purinethol) when they developed this cancer.\nYour doctor or pharmacist will give you the manufacturer’s patient information sheet (Medication Guide) when you begin treatment with infliximab and each time you receive the medication. Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. You can also visit the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website () or the manufacturer's website to obtain the Medication Guide.\nTalk to your doctor about the risks of using infliximab.\n\n# Why this medication is prescribed\nInfliximab is used to relieve the symptoms of certain autoimmune disorders (conditions in which the immune system attacks healthy parts of the body and causes pain, swelling, and damage) including:\n- rheumatoid arthritis (a condition in which the body attacks its own joints, causing pain, swelling, and loss of function) that is also being treated with methotrexate (Rheumatrex, Trexall)\n- Crohn's disease (a condition in which the body attacks the lining of the digestive tract, causing pain, diarrhea, weight loss, and fever) that has not improved when treated with other medications\n- ulcerative colitis (condition that causes swelling and sores in the lining of the large intestine) that has not improved when treated with other medications,\n- ankylosing spondylitis (a condition in which the body attacks the joints of the spine and other areas causing pain and joint damage),\n- psoriasis (a skin disease in which red, scaly patches form on some areas of the body),\n- psoriatic arthritis (joint pain and swelling and scales on the skin).\nInfliximab is in a class of medications called tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) inhibitors. It works by blocking the action of TNF-alpha, a substance in the body that causes inflammation.\n\n# How this medication should be used\nInfliximab comes as a powder to be mixed with sterile water and administered intravenously (into a vein) by a doctor or nurse. It is usually given in a doctor's office every 2-8 weeks. It will take about 2 hours for you to receive your entire dose of infliximab.\nInfliximab may cause serious allergic reactions during an infusion and for 2 hours afterward. A doctor or nurse will monitor you during this time to be sure you are not having a serious reaction to the medication. You may be given other medications to treat or prevent reactions to infliximab. Tell your doctor or nurse immediately if you experience any of the following symptoms during or shortly after your infusion: hives; rash; itching; swelling of the face, eyes, mouth, throat, tongue, lips, hands, feet, ankles, or lower legs; difficulty breathing or swallowing; flushing dizziness; fainting; fever; chills; seizures; and chest pain.\nInfliximab may help control your symptoms, but it will not cure your condition. Your doctor will watch you carefully to see how well infliximab works for you. If you have rheumatoid arthritis or Crohn's disease, your doctor may increase the amount of medication you receive, if needed.If you have Crohn's disease and your condition has not improved after 14 weeks, your doctor may stop treating you with infliximab. It is important to tell your doctor how you are feeling during your treatment.\n\n# Other uses for this medicine\nInfliximab is also sometimes used to treat juvenile arthritis (joint pain and swelling that begins in childhood), and Behcet's syndrome (ulcers in the mouth and on the genitals and inflammation of various parts of the body). Talk to your doctor about the possible risks of using this medication for your condition.\nThis medication may be prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.\n\n# Special precautions\nBefore using infliximab:\n- tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to infliximab, any medications made from murine (mouse) proteins, or any other medications. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you don't know whether a medication you are allergic to is made from murine proteins.\n- tell your doctor and pharmacist what prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking or plan to take. Be sure to mention the medications listed in the IMPORTANT WARNING section, anakinra (Kineret) and etanercept (Enbrel).

{"guideline_text": "Marshall syndrome\n\n# Overview\nMarshall syndrome is a genetic disorder of the connective tissue which can cause hearing loss. The three most common areas to be affected are the eyes which are uncommonly large, joints and the mouth and facial structures. Marshall syndrome and Stickler syndrome closely resemble each other; in fact they are so similar, some say they are the same.\n\n# Genetics\nStickler syndrome and Marshall syndrome have an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. However, there is a great deal of variation within and among families with regard to gene expression. Some may be more severely affected and others may be very mildly affected. Often these syndromes are not recognized in a family until a baby is born with Pierre Robin syndrome or some members have detached retinas or cataracts at a young age.\nBoth syndromes where correlated with mutations in the COL11A1 gene.\n\n# Clinical features\n\n## Eyes\nMyopia is the most common eye problem in Marshall syndrome. Cataracts also occur more frequently and detached retina less frequently than in Stickler syndrome. Myopia also is the most common problem with the eyes in Stickler syndrome. In the latter syndrome, extreme myopia may lead to severe eye problems such as detached retina more frequently than in Marshall syndrome, and cataracts less frequently than in Marshall syndrome.\n\n## Joints\nThe joint changes include hyperextensibility (double-jointedness) and arthritis. Babies and young children with Stickler syndrome usually have very hyperextensible joints. As an affected child gets older, they may experience pain and stiffness from overuse of a joint. Osteoarthritis of the large joints often develops during the third or fourth decade. The joint changes in Marshall syndrome are of the same type but to a lesser degree. There also may be changes in the bones that show up on X-ray but generally are not a problem.\n\n## Orofacial Structure\nThe most severe problem associated with Stickler syndrome is Pierre Robin syndrome. This refers to a cleft palate resulting from a very small lower jaw. During early fetal life, the roof of the mouth is normally open and the sides of the palate have to come together to close. If the jaw is too small, there is not enough room for the tongue which is then pushed up and gets in the way of the closing palate. Sometimes the chin is so small the baby has problems with eating and breathing if the tongue blocks the back of the throat. Cleft palate is found less frequently in Marshall Syndrome than in Stickler syndrome but still more frequently than in the general population.\nThe facial features of Marshall Syndrome include a flat midface, the appearance of large eyes, short upturned nose, and a round face. The facial features of Stickler syndrome are less prominent but include a rather long flat face, and depressed nasal bridge.\n\n## Hearing loss\nThe hearing loss associated with Stickler syndrome can be progressive and usually involves the high frequencies. Sensorineural hearing loss has been reported in as many as 100% and as low as 20% of affected individuals. A conductive loss due to otitis can magnify an existing sensorineural loss and is a frequent problem for children with Stickler or Marshall Syndrome.\n\n# Diagnosis\nDiagnosis is made based on features as well as by the very early onset of serious eye and ear disease. Because Marshall syndrome is an autosomal dominant hereditary disease, physicians can also note the characteristic appearance of the biological parent of the child. There are no tests for Stickler syndrome or Marshall syndrome. Some families with Stickler syndrome have been shown to have mutations in the Type II collagen gene on chromosome 1. However, other families do not show the linkage to the collagen gene. it is an area of active research, also the genetic testing being expensive supports that the diagnosis is made depending on the features.\n\n# Treatment\nThere is no medical treatment for either syndrome but there are some recommendations that can help with prevention or early identification of some of the problems. Children with either syndrome should have their hearing tested, and adults should be aware that the hearing loss may not develop until the adult years. Yearly visits to an ophthalmologist or other eye care professional who has been informed of the diagnosis of Stickler or Marshall syndrome is important for all affected individuals. Children should have the opportunity to have myopia corrected as early as possible, and treatment for cataracts or detached retinas may be more effective with early identification. Support for the joints is especially important during sports, and some recommend that contact sports should be avoided by those who have very loose joints.", "source": "wikidoc", "question": "According to authoritative guidelines (as summarized in the provided recommendation on Marshall syndrome), outline a comprehensive approach to the diagnosis, genetic counselling, and ongoing management and surveillance of a child suspected to have Marshall syndrome, explaining which investigations and specialist referrals you would prioritize, how you would counsel the family about inheritance and genetic testing, and what preventive measures and follow-up (including hearing, ophthalmic, and musculoskeletal advice) you would recommend and why."}
{"guideline_text": "Guidelines for imaging retinoblastoma: imaging principles and MRI standardization\n\nRetinoblastoma is the most common intraocular tumor in children. The diagnosis is usually established by the ophthalmologist on the basis of fundoscopy and US. Together with US, high-resolution MRI has emerged as an important imaging modality for pretreatment assessment, i.e. for diagnostic confirmation, detection of local tumor extent, detection of associated developmental malformation of the brain and detection of associated intracranial primitive neuroectodermal tumor (trilateral retinoblastoma). Minimum requirements for pretreatment diagnostic evaluation of retinoblastoma or mimicking lesions are presented, based on consensus among members of the European Retinoblastoma Imaging Collaboration (ERIC). The most appropriate techniques for imaging in a child with leukocoria are reviewed. CT is no longer recommended. Implementation of a standardized MRI protocol for retinoblastoma in clinical practice may benefit children worldwide, especially those with hereditary retinoblastoma, since a decreased use of CT reduces the exposure to ionizing radiation.\n\n# Introduction\nRetinoblastoma is the most common intraocular tumor in children. The incidence is one in 17,000 births. Mean age at clinical presentation is 2 years in unilateral forms (60% of cases) and 1 year in bilateral forms [bib_ref] Incidence and survival of retinoblastoma in The Netherlands: a register based study..., Moll [/bib_ref]. All bilateral forms, as well as 15% of unilateral forms are related to a constitutional (hereditary or de novo) mutation of the RB-1 gene, localized on chromosome 13q14. Usually the patients present with leukocoria (white pupil reflection) or a squint.\nRetinoblastoma is curable. If detected while still confined to the globe and if there are no metastatic risk factors, the child will nearly always survive following appropriate treatment [bib_ref] Retinoblastoma management: advances in enucleation, intravenous chemoreduction, and intraarterial chemotherapy, Shields [/bib_ref] [bib_ref] Retinoblastoma in the 20th century: past success and future challenges the Weisenfeld..., Abramson [/bib_ref]. The preservation of visual function depends on ocular preservation, initial tumor volume, the anatomical relationships of the tumors to the macula and optic disk and the adverse effects of the treatments (cataracts, vitreous hemorrhage). In the presence of metastatic risk factors, adjuvant treatment regimens are usually applied to prevent life-threatening relapse [bib_ref] Intensive multimodality therapy for patients with stage 4a metastatic retinoblastoma, Dunkel [/bib_ref] [bib_ref] High-dose chemotherapy with autologous hematopoietic stem cell rescue for stage 4B retinoblastoma, Dunkel [/bib_ref].\nDiagnosis of retinoblastoma is usually made by fundoscopy (under general anesthesia) and US. The ophthalmologist usually performs both investigations. In almost all cases classic intratumoral calcifications can be detected by US providing high confidence rate regarding diagnosis. Various tumor parameters (laterality; number, location and size of tumors; tumor seeding to vitreous, subretinal space or anterior segment) can be evaluated with these techniques. These are important for grouping the retinoblastoma and to guide therapeutic decisions. Further diagnostic imaging plays a crucial role in determining the local extent and for detecting associated brain abnormalities, i. e. intracranial tumor extension, possible midline intracranial primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET) and brain malformations in patients with 13q deletion syndrome [bib_ref] Dysmorphic phenotype and neurological impairment in 22 retinoblastoma patients with constitutional cytogenetic..., Baud [/bib_ref] [bib_ref] Deletion and central nervous system anomalies: further insights from karyotype-phenotype analyses of..., Ballarati [/bib_ref] [bib_ref] Brain abnormalities on MR imaging in patients with retinoblastoma, Rodjan [/bib_ref].\nPNETs are associated with hereditary retinoblastoma, a combination known as trilateral retinoblastoma, which occurs in 5-15% of children in the hereditary subgroup [bib_ref] Brain abnormalities on MR imaging in patients with retinoblastoma, Rodjan [/bib_ref] [bib_ref] Trilateral retinoblastoma: a meta-analysis of hereditary retinoblastoma associated with primary ectopic intracranial..., Kivela [/bib_ref]. Besides the pineal region (pineoblastoma), tumors may also occur in the suprasellar or parasellar regions. Trilateral retinoblastoma has been lethal in virtually all cases reported in literature; however, early detection and intensive (chemo-)therapy may be lifesaving for some patients [bib_ref] Brain abnormalities on MR imaging in patients with retinoblastoma, Rodjan [/bib_ref] [bib_ref] Trilateral retinoblastoma: potentially curable with intensive chemotherapy, Dunkel [/bib_ref] [bib_ref] Successful treatment of early detected trilateral retinoblastoma using standard infant brain tumor..., Wright [/bib_ref].\nConservative treatment strategies (avoidance of enucleation and external beam radiation therapy) can be successful in the early stages of retinoblastoma and in some patients with advanced intraocular disease [bib_ref] Conservative treatments of intraocular retinoblastoma, Lumbroso-Le Rouic [/bib_ref]. The options for eyepreserving therapy have significantly improved during recent years and are mainly based on tumor reduction with chemotherapy, and are usually combined with laser coagulation, cryotherapy or radioactive plaque. Recently, selective ophthalmic artery infusion of a chemotherapeutic agent became available as an additional treatment option for locally advanced disease [bib_ref] Superselective ophthalmic artery chemotherapy as primary treatment for retinoblastoma (chemosurgery), Abramson [/bib_ref]. As a consequence, more children are treated without histopathological confirmation and, what is more important, without assessment of risk factors for disease dissemination and prognosis. Therefore, imaging is very important in local staging.\nWhereas imaging is increasingly used for diagnosis and as a basis for treatment decisions in retinoblastoma, there is a lack of standardization for choosing among modalities and for the minimum quality of MRI. The purpose of this report is to present a guideline for diagnostic imaging of retinoblastoma including a standardized MRI protocol using conventional pulse sequences. The potential role of advanced imaging techniques for lesion characterization and detection of tumor extent (such as 3D T1-weighted sequences, diffusion-weighted imaging, diffusion tensor imaging and MR-spectroscopy) is beyond the scope of this guideline.\n\n## Risk factors for metastasis and local recurrence\nRetinoblastoma may spread either by hematogenous dissemination or by direct extension either through the bulbar wall into the orbit or via the optic nerve and its meningeal sheath [bib_ref] Optic nerve invasion of retinoblastoma. Metastatic potential and clinical risk factors, Shields [/bib_ref]. Therefore, current risk factors for metastasis and local recurrence include invasion of the optic nerve posterior to the lamina cribrosa (in particular if there is tumor at the surgical resection margin), anterior eye segment (AES), or extensive invasion of the ocular coats (massive choroidal and scleral invasion) [bib_ref] Risk factors for extraocular relapse following enucleation after failure of chemoreduction in..., Chantada [/bib_ref] [bib_ref] Outcome of patients with retinoblastoma and postlaminar optic nerve invasion, Chantada [/bib_ref] [bib_ref] Evaluation of chemoprophylaxis in patients with unilateral retinoblastoma with high-risk features on..., Uusitalo [/bib_ref] [bib_ref] Postenucleation adjuvant therapy in high-risk retinoblastoma, Honavar [/bib_ref]. Pathology remains the gold standard to assess high-risk features of retinoblastoma. The rate of postlaminar optic nerve invasion Fundus photograph shows two tumors. The large white mass with prominent feeder vessels is located at the macula causing reduced visual acuity. A smaller tumor is located in the inferolateral part of the retina.

In patients with hereditary retinoblastoma, the cumulative incidence of a second primary malignancy within 40 years of the initial retinoblastoma is 28% [bib_ref] Risk of second malignancies in survivors of retinoblastoma: more than 40 years..., Marees [/bib_ref]. Chemotherapy has been reported to increase the risk of leukemia in survivors of retinoblastoma [bib_ref] Secondary acute myelogenous leukemia in patients with retinoblastoma: is chemotherapy a factor, Gombos [/bib_ref]. Radiotherapy is associated with an increased risk of soft-tissue sarcomas in survivors of hereditary retinoblastoma, with a reported significant association of radiation dose with the risk of second primary (or more) cancers [bib_ref] Risk of second malignancies in survivors of retinoblastoma: more than 40 years..., Marees [/bib_ref] [bib_ref] Cancer incidence after retinoblastoma. Radiation dose and sarcoma risk, Wong [/bib_ref]. Assuming a linear relation between radiation dose and stochastic risk, several studies have demonstrated a theoretical increased risk of CT-associated radiation-induced fatal cancers in children [bib_ref] Estimated risks of radiation-induced fatal cancer from pediatric CT, Brenner [/bib_ref]. Although low, this risk is likely to be further increased in patients with hereditary retinoblastoma, who are known to be genetically unstable, due to the inherited germ cell mutation in the RB-1 tumor-suppressor gene. To minimize the development of subsequent cancers, survivors of retinoblastoma are advised to avoid unnecessary radiation. Furthermore, children undergoing radiotherapy for retinoblastoma may experience abnormalities in the growth and maturation of their craniofacial skeleton, resulting in mid-face deformities [bib_ref] Quantification of orbital and mid-facial growth retardation after megavoltage external beam irradiation..., Imhof [/bib_ref]. For these reasons, external beam radiotherapy was dramatically reduced for the conservative treatment options, and the principle of minimizing the exposure to ionizing radiation should also be applied to imaging. US and MRI should be used instead of CT. The radiation from interventional procedures, e.g., selective ophthalmic artery chemotherapy infusion, is also important [bib_ref] Irradiation toxic effects during intra-arterial chemotherapy for retinoblastoma: should we be concerned?, Vijayakrishnan [/bib_ref]. The radiation dose should be optimized, precisely measured and clearly reported in future publications to facilitate balancing risks and benefits both in imaging and therapy.\nChoice of imaging modality US, CT and MRI are the mainstay for imaging of head and neck tumors in children. US is particularly useful for examining superficial masses, such as retinoblastoma, whereas CT and MRI are used to delineate deeper lesions, particularly those involving the skull base and the central nervous system. Nowadays, diagnostic evaluation of retinoblastoma consists primarily of US and MRI. Positron emission tomography has become an important modality for cancer imaging in general; however, its value in retinoblastoma imaging is currently limited [bib_ref] Fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (PET) to detect vital retinoblastoma in the..., Moll [/bib_ref].\n\n## Us\nThe human eye, with its superficial position and its fluidfilled structures, is ideally suited for US. Ocular US is usually performed by the ophthalmologist while the child is under general anesthesia, but can also quite easily be performed without sedation. In retinoblastoma, US demonstrates an irregular mass, more echogenic than the vitreous body, with fine calcifications (highly reflective foci mostly with characteristic acoustic shadowing) [bib_ref] Retinoblastoma: sonographic findings with pathologic correlation in pediatric patients, Kaste [/bib_ref] [fig_ref] Figure 2: US reveals a hyperechoic tumor occupying the posterior segment of the globe [/fig_ref]. Histologically, there is calcification present in approximately 95% of tumors [bib_ref] Is CT still useful in the study protocol of retinoblastoma?, Galluzzi [/bib_ref]. Calcification is key to differentiating retinoblastoma from other mass lesions in a young child. US detects calcifications in 92-95% of cases where it is present histopathologically [bib_ref] Is CT still useful in the study protocol of retinoblastoma?, Galluzzi [/bib_ref] [bib_ref] Echography of retinoblastoma: histopathologic correlation and serial evaluation after globe-conserving radiotherapy or..., Roth [/bib_ref]. Retinal detachment may also be observed, which is an important feature to Calcium deposits, seen as highly reflective foci (arrows), are pathognomonic for retinoblastoma in a young child define tumor growth pattern, either endophytic or exophytic, or a combination of both. Endophytic tumors arise from the inner layers of the retina and grow into the vitreous body. Frequently, small clusters of tumor cells detach from an endophytic mass, producing multiple floating tumor islands; this process is known as vitreous seeding. Exophytic tumors originate in the outer layers and grow in the subretinal space, which causes retinal detachment with subretinal exudate and possible subretinal tumor seeding. Tumors with exophytic growth more frequently have choroidal infiltration compared to endophytic tumors [bib_ref] Retinoblastoma -MR appearance using a surface coil in comparison with histopathological results, Lemke [/bib_ref]. Diffusely infiltrating retinoblastoma is a rare histological form characterized by diffuse infiltration of the retina without a tumor mass [bib_ref] Sonographic, CT, and MR imaging findings in diffuse infiltrative retinoblastoma: report of..., Brisse [/bib_ref]. Tumor height and diameter are usually measured at US, as these measurements are used for choice of treatment. Color Doppler can be useful for differentiating a vascularized tumor mass from echogenic effusions and for differentiation against developmental abnormalities such as persistent hyperplastic primary vitreous (PHPV; also known as persistent fetal vasculature, PFV), with the characteristic persisting hyaloid artery.\nUS is not the imaging modality of choice for direct evaluation of metastatic risk factors. Tumoral calcifications commonly obscure visualization of the optic nerve [bib_ref] Retinoblastoma: sonographic findings with pathologic correlation in pediatric patients, Kaste [/bib_ref]. Indirect detection of optic nerve invasion by measurement of optic nerve diameter with a 3D-US technique has been reported in a single case report [bib_ref] Three dimensional ultrasound of retinoblastoma: initial experience, Finger [/bib_ref] , hence its value remains unknown.\n\n## Ct\nOn CT, retinoblastoma is typically a mass of high density compared with the vitreous body, usually calcified and moderately enhancing after iodinated contrast medium administration. CT detection of calcifications in retinoblastoma has a sensitivity of 81-96%, and an even higher specificity [bib_ref] Retinoblastoma: CT and MRI, Beets-Tan [/bib_ref]. However, delineation of intraocular soft-tissue detail is limited. The evidence from surveys suggests that CT is still regarded an obligatory imaging tool for evaluation of leukocoria, primarily because CT is supposed to be the best imaging modality for detection of intraocular calcifications [bib_ref] Retinoblastoma: CT and MRI, Beets-Tan [/bib_ref] [bib_ref] From the archives of the AFIP: Pediatric orbit tumors and tumorlike lesions:..., Chung [/bib_ref] [bib_ref] Best cases from the AFIP: Trilateral retinoblastoma, James [/bib_ref]. However, justification of the irradiation of a large group of retinoblastoma patients requires a base of evidence of the procedure's clinical effectiveness and possibly also radiationeffectiveness [bib_ref] Radiation exposure in CT: what is the professionally responsible approach, Golding [/bib_ref] for supplying (1) valuable additional information leading toward the diagnosis of retinoblastoma and (2) valuable additional information, compared to nonionizing radiation modalities in detection of tumor extent.\nCT was the first imaging modality used to detect optic nerve invasion [bib_ref] Orbital computed tomography. Does it help in diagnosing the infiltration of choroid,..., John-Mikolajewski [/bib_ref] [bib_ref] Detection of optic nerve involvement in retinoblastoma with enhanced computed tomography, Jacquemin [/bib_ref] [bib_ref] CT diagnosis of retinoblastoma with histopathologic correlations, Olivecrona [/bib_ref] and is historically assumed to be precise in detection of tumor extent [bib_ref] Medical imaging in pediatric ophthalmology, Mafee [/bib_ref] [bib_ref] Retinoblastoma and simulating lesions: role of imaging, Apushkin [/bib_ref]. However, this assumption is based on conflicting outdated literature, without thorough evidence by radiologic-pathologic correlation studies. The sensitivity of CT in detection of optic nerve invasion is actually very low, even in patients with extensive optic nerve invasion (length of invaded nerve segment > 2 mm) [bib_ref] Relevance of CT and MRI in retinoblastoma for the diagnosis of postlaminar..., Brisse [/bib_ref] [bib_ref] Orbital computed tomography. Does it help in diagnosing the infiltration of choroid,..., John-Mikolajewski [/bib_ref] [bib_ref] CT diagnosis of retinoblastoma with histopathologic correlations, Olivecrona [/bib_ref]. The specificity, accuracy and negative predictive value of CT remain artificially high because of the relatively low incidence of optic nerve invasion in normal-size nerves. An enlarged nerve due to massive tumor infiltration is rare in developed countries. Assuming retinoblastoma invasion into the optic nerve produces distortion of the anastomotic vascular network in the anterior optic nerve region, Jacquemin and Karcioglu [bib_ref] Detection of optic nerve involvement in retinoblastoma with enhanced computed tomography, Jacquemin [/bib_ref] considered that non-visualization of the central retinal vessels is a reliable indicator of optic nerve invasion. However, these results were not confirmed by other studies [bib_ref] Relevance of CT and MRI in retinoblastoma for the diagnosis of postlaminar..., Brisse [/bib_ref].\n\n## Mri\nDiagnostic MRI evaluation of a suspected retinoblastoma requires much more than performing a routine MR imaging examination of the orbit. High-resolution contrast-enhanced MRI is the technique of choice and should be used whenever possible to answer the key clinical questions (to evaluate an intraocular mass and to determine disease extent; [fig_ref] Figure 3: Transaxial T2-weighted [/fig_ref].

As US detects foci of calcification in almost all retinoblastomas, there is now little benefit of routine CT for detection of calcifications in suspected retinoblastoma. Due to technical development, US and MRI are currently almost as accurate as CT for detection of calcifications. Recently, Galluzzi et al. [bib_ref] Is CT still useful in the study protocol of retinoblastoma?, Galluzzi [/bib_ref] showed that when data from ophthalmoscopy, US and MRI are put together, no calcifications detected on CT were missed. A high-resolution gradient-echo T2-weighted sequence showed promising results regarding detection of calcifications and has been shown to be more effective than spin-echo techniques [bib_ref] Is CT still useful in the study protocol of retinoblastoma?, Galluzzi [/bib_ref] [bib_ref] Retinoblastoma -MR appearance using a surface coil in comparison with histopathological results, Lemke [/bib_ref].\nThe differential diagnosis of retinoblastoma includes several non-neoplastic lesions that also cause leukocoria.\nAfter retinoblastoma, which accounts for 47-58% of cases of leukocoria in children, other causes in decreasing order of frequency include PHPV, Coats disease, larval granulomatosis (Toxocara canis), retinopathy of prematurity, and retinal astrocytic hamartoma [bib_ref] From the archives of the AFIP: Pediatric orbit tumors and tumorlike lesions:..., Chung [/bib_ref]. Calcification is the most important differentiating feature of retinoblastoma. However, when clinical diagnosis remains uncertain, US and MRI help characterize and differentiate intraocular abnormalities, especially when ophthalmological evaluation is limited due to opaque ocular refractive media, as may occur in all of these conditions. The role of CT in the detection of (sometimes subtle) characteristic findings is limited due to its low soft-tissue contrast [bib_ref] From the archives of the AFIP: Pediatric orbit tumors and tumorlike lesions:..., Chung [/bib_ref] [bib_ref] Retinoblastoma and simulating lesions: role of imaging, Apushkin [/bib_ref].\n\n## Detection of tumor extent\nIn the past, CT was used to determine tumor size, retroorbital spread and intracranial growth; however, spread within the optic nerve past the cribriform lamina, and infiltration of choroid and sclera, which are important prognostic factors, are not reliably assessed with CT [bib_ref] Orbital computed tomography. Does it help in diagnosing the infiltration of choroid,..., John-Mikolajewski [/bib_ref] [bib_ref] CT diagnosis of retinoblastoma with histopathologic correlations, Olivecrona [/bib_ref]. Because of its superior soft-tissue contrast, MRI is more sensitive and specific than CT in detection of tumor extent and metastatic risk factors. MR imaging using highresolution protocols is currently considered to be the most accurate and valuable tool in pretreatment staging of retinoblastoma, without known biological side effects.\n\n## Standardized retinoblastoma mri protocol\nAlthough individual examinations should always be tailored to the specific queries in individual patients (laterality, disease extent, therapy options), there are general recommendations for MRI in retinoblastoma. In the following paragraphs we . If these recommen-dations cannot be followed because of technical limitation, ERIC members recommend to refer the patient to the nearest (or national) reference center for retinoblastoma, where a multidisciplinary team of specialized physicians (ophthalmology, pediatric oncology, radiology, pathology, radiotherapy, clinical genetics, psychology) and specialized nurses will ensure that practice conforms to the best standards of care.\n\n## Patient handling\nAlthough the technical success of MRI usually depends on the cooperation of the patient, in retinoblastoma appropriate sedation techniques or general anesthesia are nowadays widely used, with a high yield of diagnostic scans. Nevertheless, in our experience the success rate of intravenous sedation is highly dependent on the presence of trained anesthetists and of the choice of radiofrequency coils. Especially, the use of small surface coils decreases the success rate, because these coils need to be accurately positioned close to the eye. The depth of sedation may be insufficient for accurate patient positioning. Therefore, general anesthesia is recommended for MRI in children with retinoblastoma. Another advantage of general anesthesia is the possibility to ensure that the eyelids are fully closed and to avoid uncontrolled eye movements by putting pads (fixed with tape) on the closed eyelids. Thereby\n\n## Requirements\nScanner and coils Field strength above 1 T 1.5-T system combined with one or two small surface coils (diameter < 5 cm) 3.0-T system combined with multichannel head coil Sequences (minimum requirements) Orbits Transaxial T2-W (slice thickness ≤ 2 mm) Optional: Transaxial CISS (Siemens) / FIESTA (GE) / DRIVE (Philips) Eye(s) and optic nerve(s) In-plane pixel size < 0.5 × 0.5 mm; slice thickness ≤ 2 mm Unilateral disease (or bilateral disease with only one eye strongly affected) Precontrast T1-W; at least one plane: transaxial or sagittal oblique T2-W; at least one plane: transaxial or sagittal oblique Postcontrast T1-W, no FS; transaxial and sagittal oblique Bilateral disease (both eyes strongly affected) Precontrast T1-W (transaxial) T2-W (transaxial) Postcontrast T1-W, no FS; sagittal oblique of both eyes and transaxial Brain Transaxial T2-W (slice thickness ≤ 4 mm) Postcontrast T1-W (2D SE with slice thickness ≤ 3 mm or 3D GRE ≤ 1 mm) FS fat-saturation, SE spin-echo, GRE gradient-echo a Consensus among members of the European Retinoblastoma Imaging Collaboration (ERIC) a Thin-slice transaxial T2-weighted (TR/TE, 4,430/102 ms; section thickness, 2 mm) image demonstrates retinoblastoma of the right eye with secondary retinal detachment. b Transaxial constructive interference steady-state (TR/TE, 14/7 ms) image of bilateral retinoblastoma with secondary retinal detachment. Notice the shallow anterior chamber of the right eye, a sign of increased intraocular pressure susceptibility artifacts caused by air-tissue interface or by air bubbles under the eyelids is avoided, which is favorable for the image quality in the anterior eye segment. If possible, the MR examination can be combined with fundoscopy and US under the same general anesthetic.\n\n## Hardware\nClinical MRI of orbit and eyes is mostly acquired using the current standard field strengths up to 1.5 T. Since adequate imaging of retinoblastoma requires high spatial resolution, the field strength of the MR system should be at least 1.5 T. The performance of scans at 1.5 T using a head coil is the most practical approach for evaluation of retinoblastoma. However, this combination usually gives insufficient signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at required in-plane image resolution and section thickness. Therefore, scanning at 1.5 T should always be performed with one or two small surface coils (diameter ≤ 5 cm) to reliably detect small lesions and metastatic risk factors [fig_ref] Figure 4: High-resolution MRI in retinoblastoma [/fig_ref]. Indeed, the use of surface coils in ocular tumors has been reported to increase the diagnostic accuracy [bib_ref] Retinoblastoma -MR appearance using a surface coil in comparison with histopathological results, Lemke [/bib_ref] [bib_ref] Uveal melanoma: correlation of histopathologic and radiologic findings by using thin-section MR..., Lemke [/bib_ref].\nThe main advantage of higher field strengths (3 T) is the increased SNR. Publications on ocular 3-T MRI are still limited [bib_ref] Orbital and ocular imaging using 3-and 1.5-T MR imaging systems, Mafee [/bib_ref] [bib_ref] Eye imaging with a 3.0-T MRI using a surface coil-a study on..., Lemke [/bib_ref]. At 3 T with multi-channel head coil or surface coils one can achieve high-resolution images similar to those obtained at 1.5 T with surface coils [fig_ref] Figure 5: Transaxial contrast-enhanced T1-weighted [/fig_ref]. We think the diagnostic accuracy for detection of tumor extent might improve, but there is currently no published evidence for this. b Transaxial precontrast T1-weighted (TR/TE 360/13 ms) image. c Transaxial postcontrast T1-weighted (TR/TE 360/13 ms) image. Notice the inhomogeneous enhancement pattern, which is common in retinoblastoma Imaging protocol MRI protocols vary because of differences in available equipment and individual preferences. However, despite differences, certain basic elements are common to most imaging protocols for retinoblastoma. The minimal requirements for diagnostic evaluation of retinoblastoma or mimicking lesions according to the consensus reached among members of the European Retinoblastoma Imaging Collaboration (ERIC) are presented below and summarized in [fig_ref] Table 1: MRI protocol in retinoblastoma a [/fig_ref]. A typical MR imaging protocol for retinoblastoma should always include high-resolution imaging of the affected eye(s) and imaging of the entire brain.\n\n## Orbits\nRegardless of laterality, at least one transaxial thin-slice (≤ 2 mm) T2-weighted sequence should cover both orbits. For T2-weighted imaging based on a (fast) spin-echo technique, it is recommended to use a long TE (heavily T2-weighted; TE ≥ 120 ms) for generating the image contrast necessary to provide an optimal differentiation of retinoblastoma and surrounding vitreous or subretinal fluid . Fat saturation combined with T2-weighted imaging is not recommended. When fat suppression is used, the resulting loss in SNR should be compensated (e.g., by increasing the number of acquisitions).\nT2-W spin-echo may be replaced by gradient-echo T2weighted sequences such as 3D steady-state free precession sequences with slice thickness ≤ 1 mm ; vendorspecific acronyms: CISS [Constructive Interference in Steady State, Siemens], FIESTA [Fast Imaging Employing Steady State Acquisition, GE Healthcare]; DRIVE [Driven Equilibrium, Philips]) (slice thickness, ≤ 1 mm). These pulse sequences provide detailed images of both orbits and eyes, and allow accurate comparison of eye size, anterior chamber depth and laterality. Very small tumors can be depicted with these techniques.\n\n## Eye and distal optic nerve\nIncreased spatial resolution will improve the accuracy of MRI in assessing the anatomical details of the papilla, lamina cribrosa and pre-and postlaminar segments of the optic nerve. The continuous improvement of MR units and the use of small fields-of-view with either multichannel head coils or surface coils now allows much higher image resolution. High spatial resolution means section thickness ≤ 2 mm and in-plane pixel size ≤ 0.5 × 0.5 mm. For optimal detection of optic nerve invasion, the image plane through the orbit (transaxial and sagittal oblique) should align with the orientation of the distal (1 cm) end of the nerve, just posterior to the lamina cribrosa [fig_ref] Figure 7: Recommended slice positions [/fig_ref]. One section in each of these sequences should be precisely aligned within the distal part of the optic nerve at the level of the middle of the optic disk. Although the use of the fatsaturation technique is highly recommended for contrastenhanced MR imaging in orbital pathology, its use in highresolution contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI in retinoblastoma is declining [bib_ref] Retinoblastoma -MR appearance using a surface coil in comparison with histopathological results, Lemke [/bib_ref] [bib_ref] High resolution magnetic resonance imaging of retinoblastoma, Schueler [/bib_ref]. In the minimal requirements for diagnostic evaluation of retinoblastoma or mimicking lesions according to the consensus reached among members of the ERIC, the use of fat saturation in contrast-enhanced T1-weighted sequences is no longer recommended. The recommended protocol for high-resolution MR imaging of the eye(s) and distal optic nerve(s) differs slightly between unilateral or bilateral disease [fig_ref] Table 1: MRI protocol in retinoblastoma a [/fig_ref] , [fig_ref] Figure 9: MRI of bilateral retinoblastoma with extensive disease in both eyes should be... [/fig_ref]. Incidence of metastatic risk factors is highly MR images show small nodular enhancement at the optic nerve disk (arrow), which represents superficial optic nerve invasion by intraocular tumor seeding (predilection site). c Abnormal contrastenhancement of the anterior eye segment combined with macroscopic tumor seedings (arrow) dependent on tumor location and tumor size. Therefore, a distinction is made between bilateral disease with only one eye strongly affected (high-resolution MRI can be performed in the worst affected eye only) and extensive disease in both eyes (high-resolution MRI of both eyes).\n\n## Brain\nThe brain should always be imaged in retinoblastoma patients for analysis of midline structures in order to depict trilateral retinoblastoma (i.e. PNET located mainly in the pineal gland, or more rarely in suprasellar area) or leptomeningeal spread. For a patient presenting with leukocoria suspicious of having retinoblastoma or already diagnosed as retinoblastoma based on clinical findings and US, the baseline evaluation should include an MR imaging of the brain that meets the standardized protocol. Imaging of the brain is performed with (multi-channel) headcoil only and should at least include the following or similar types of sequences:\n& Transaxial fast spin-echo T2-weighted sequence (slice thickness, ≤ 4 mm). This sequence provides an overview of the brain anatomy and structural abnormalities (patients with 13q deletion syndrome). & Transaxial or sagittal contrast-enhanced T1-weighted sequence (2D spin-echo T1-weighted with slice thickness ≤ 3 mm; or 3D gradient-echo with slice thickness ≤1 mm).\nThis sequence provides information about enhancement of the pineal gland, presence of a midline PNET, leptomeningeal metastases and extensive optic nerve invasion.\n& Coronal and sagittal high-resolution T2-weighted sequence (slice thickness, 1.5 mm). These sequences are optional but should be added to the protocol in case of an atypical pineal gland (partially cystic, irregular, enlarged). Image analysis checklist for MR reporting [fig_ref] Table 2: Retinoblastoma [/fig_ref] Tumor size and location\nCompared to the vitreous body, retinoblastoma has moderately higher signal intensity on T1-and lower on T2-weighted images. Increased size of the globe, globe deformation and reduced anterior chamber depth are signs of increased intraocular pressure and are usually associated with buphtalmia [fig_ref] Figure 10: Retinoblastoma with signs of increased intraocular pressure following subretinal hemorrhage [/fig_ref]. These signs should be mentioned since they are associated with a higher risk of globe rupture and secondary orbital seeding during enucleation. Laterality and growth pattern should be mentioned as well as the location of the tumor, with respect to the equator of the eye (anterior, posterior or combined) and with respect to the papilla (the optic nerve disk) and the macula. One should in particular identify tumor close to the optic disk, because this may invade the nerve [bib_ref] Retinoblastoma: MR imaging parameters in detection of tumor extent, De Graaf [/bib_ref].\n\n## Optic nerve and meningeal sheath invasion\nIn normal-size optic nerves, the direct radiological criterion used to diagnose postlaminar nerve invasion is the presence of abnormal contrast enhancement (enhancement ≥ 2 mm in diameter) in the distal nerve [bib_ref] Relevance of CT and MRI in retinoblastoma for the diagnosis of postlaminar..., Brisse [/bib_ref] [fig_ref] Figure 2: US reveals a hyperechoic tumor occupying the posterior segment of the globe [/fig_ref]. Interruption of the normal linear enhancement at the optic nerve disk (choroidoretinal complex) supports a suggestion of optic nerve invasion [bib_ref] Retinoblastoma: MR imaging parameters in detection of tumor extent, De Graaf [/bib_ref]. Postlaminar optic nerve or optic nerve menigeal sheath invasion should raise suspicion of leptomeningeal metastases. In such situations, additional contrast-enhanced sagittal T1-weighted imaging of the whole spine is recommended.\n\n## Ocular wall invasion and extraocular extension\nDiscontinuity of the normal choroidal enhancement is the leading criterion for infiltration [bib_ref] Retinoblastoma: MR imaging parameters in detection of tumor extent, De Graaf [/bib_ref] [bib_ref] Histopathologic risk factors in retinoblastoma: a retrospective study of 172 patients treated..., Khelfaoui [/bib_ref] [fig_ref] Figure 3: Transaxial T2-weighted [/fig_ref]. Massive choroidal invasion presents as focal choroidal thickening [fig_ref] Figure 3: Transaxial T2-weighted [/fig_ref]. Increased enhancement and thickening of the entire uveal tract (choroid, ciliary body, iris) is a sign of uveitis, usually secondary to massive (sub) total tumor necrosis [bib_ref] Retinoblastoma: MR imaging parameters in detection of tumor extent, De Graaf [/bib_ref]. Protrusion of enhancing tissue through the thickened choroid into the (low signal-intensity) sclera or beyond is a sign of scleral invasion or extraocular extension, respectively.\n\n## Anterior eye segment\nAnterior eye segment enhancement occurs frequently in retinoblastoma and is usually a sign of iris angiogenesis [bib_ref] Retinoblastoma: abnormal gadolinium enhancement of anterior segment of eyes at MR imaging..., Galluzzi [/bib_ref] [bib_ref] Contrastenhancement of the anterior eye segment in patients with retinoblastoma: correlation between..., De Graaf [/bib_ref]. Tumor invasion into the anterior eye segment is an infrequent finding, usually associated with anteriorly located retinoblastoma. Enhancement of the tumor extending into the ciliary body or beyond should raise suspicion of anterior eye segment invasion. Transaxial T2-weighted images of both orbits can be used to depict a decreased anterior chamber depth [fig_ref] Figure 10: Retinoblastoma with signs of increased intraocular pressure following subretinal hemorrhage [/fig_ref].\n\n## Brain\nCareful analysis of midline structures should be performed to depict trilateral retinoblastoma (i.e. PNET located mainly in the pineal gland, or rarely in the suprasellar area) [fig_ref] Figure 4: High-resolution MRI in retinoblastoma [/fig_ref] or leptomeningeal spread (if patient shows extensive postlaminar optic nerve invasion enhancement). Congenital brain malformations occur mainly in patients with 13q-deletion syndrome [bib_ref] Brain abnormalities on MR imaging in patients with retinoblastoma, Rodjan [/bib_ref]. Benign pineal cysts should not be misinterpreted as pineal PNET, even in children with retinoblastoma [bib_ref] Brain abnormalities on MR imaging in patients with retinoblastoma, Rodjan [/bib_ref] [bib_ref] Benign pineal cysts in children with bilateral retinoblastoma: a new variant of..., Beck [/bib_ref]. Thin-section T2weighted and contrast-enhanced T1-weighted slices are helpful for differential diagnoses. In doubtful cases, close follow-up with MRI is recommended.\n\n# Conclusion\nTogether with US, high-resolution MR imaging has emerged as the most important imaging modality in the assessment of retinoblastoma-for diagnostic confirmation and for determination of local tumor extent and associated intracranial abnormalities. CT is no longer indicated in children with leukocoria because of (1) ionizing radiation and (2) no added diagnostic value. US combined with MRI using our suggested standardized retinoblastoma MRI protocol provides state-of-the-art pretreatment diagnostic evaluation in children with retinoblastoma.\nOpen Access This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Noncommercial License which permits any noncommercial use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author(s) and source are credited.\n[fig] Figure 2: US reveals a hyperechoic tumor occupying the posterior segment of the globe.

{"guideline_text": "Fundus camera\nA fundus camera or retinal camera is a specialized low power microscope with an attached camera designed to photograph the interior surface of the eye, including the retina, optic disc, macula, and posterior pole (i.e. the fundus).\nFundus cameras are used by optometrists, ophthalmologists, and trained medical professionals for monitoring progression of a disease, diagnosis of a disease (combined with retinal angiography), or in screening programs, where the photos can be analysed later.\n\n# Optical principles\nThe optical design of fundus cameras is based on the principle of monocular indirect ophthalmoscopy. A fundus camera provides an upright, magnified view of the fundus. A typical camera views 30 to 50 degrees of retinal area, with a magnification of 2.5x, and allows some modification of this relationship through zoom or auxiliary lenses from 15 degrees which provides 5x magnification to 140 degrees with a wide angle lens which minifies the image by half. The optics of a fundus camera is similar to that of an indirect in that the observation and illumination systems follow dissimilar paths. The observation light is focused via a series of lenses through a doughnut shaped aperture, which then passes through a central aperture to form an annulus, before passing through the camera objective lens and through the cornea onto the retina. The light reflected from the retina passes through the un-illuminated hole in the doughnut formed by the illumination system. As the light paths of the two systems are independent, there are minimal reflections of the light source captured in the formed image. The image forming rays continue towards the low powered telescopic eyepiece. When the button is pressed to take a picture, a mirror interrupts the path of the illumination system allow the light from the flash bulb to pass into the eye. Simultaneously, a mirror falls in front of the observation telescope, which redirects the light onto the capturing medium, whether it is film or a digital CCD. Because of the eye’s tendency to accommodate while looking though a telescope, it is imperative that the exiting vergence is parallel in order for an in focus image to be formed on the capturing medium.\nSince the instruments are complex in design and difficult to manufacture to clinical standards, only a few manufacturers exist: Topcon, Zeiss, Canon, Nikon, and Kowa.\n\n# Applications\nPractical instruments for fundus photography perform the following modes of examination:\n- Color, where the retina is illuminated by white light and examined in full color.\n- Red-free, where the imaging light is filtered to remove red colors, improving contrast of vessels and other structures.\n- Angiography, where the vessels are brought into high contrast by intravenous injection of a fluorescent dye.  The retina is illuminated with an excitation color which fluoresces light of another color where the dye is present.  By filtering to exclude the excitation color and pass the fluorescent color, a very high-contrast image of the vessels is produced.  Shooting a timed sequence of photographs of the progression of the dye into the vessels reveals the flow dynamics and related pathologies. Specific methods include sodium fluorescein angiography (abbreviated FA or FAG) and indocyanine green (abbreviated ICG) angiography.", "source": "wikidoc", "question": "According to authoritative guidelines, discuss how clinicians should select and use a fundus (retinal) camera for diagnosis, monitoring, and screening—addressing the relevant optical principles that determine field of view and magnification, the clinical implications of different imaging modes (color, red‑free, fluorescein and indocyanine green angiography), practical indications and limitations for each application, and the key device- and service-related factors (including operator training, image capture workflow, and lens/zoom options) that should guide procurement and clinical deployment."}

Please mail us  to indicate your interest in serving either as an Editor-In-Chief of the entire topic or as an Associate Editor-In-Chief for a subtopic. Please be sure to attach your CV and or biographical sketch.\n\n# Overview\nPublic health is the study and practice of managing threats to the health of a community. The field pays special attention to the social context of disease and health, and focuses on improving health through society-wide measures like vaccinations, the fluoridation of drinking water, or through policies like seatbelt and non-smoking laws.\nThe goal of public health is to improve lives through the prevention or treatment of disease. The United Nations' World Health Organization defines health as \"a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.\"  In 1920, C.E.A. Winslow defined public health as \"the science and art of preventing disease, prolonging life and promoting health through the organized efforts and informed choices of society, organizations, public and private, communities and individuals.\"\nThe public-health approach can be applied to a population of just a handful of people or to the whole human population. Public health is typically divided into epidemiology, biostatistics and health services. Environmental, social, behavioral, and occupational health are also important subfields.\n\n# Objectives\nThe focus of a public health intervention is to prevent rather than treat a disease through surveillance of cases and the promotion of healthy behaviors. In addition to these activities, in many cases treating a disease can be vital to preventing its spread to others, such as during an outbreak of infectious disease or contamination of food or water supplies. Vaccination programs and distribution of condoms are examples of public health measures.\nMost countries have their own government public health agencies, sometimes known as ministries of health, to respond to domestic health issues. In the United States, the frontline of public health initiatives are state and local health departments. The United States Public Health Service (PHS), led by the Surgeon General of the United States, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, headquartered in Atlanta and a part of the PHS, are involved with several international health activities, in addition to their national duties.\nThere is a vast discrepancy in access to healthcare and public health intiatives between developed nations and developing nations. In the developing world, public health infrastructures are still forming. There may not be enough trained health workers or monetary resources to provide even a basic level of medical care and disease prevention. As a result, a large majority of disease and mortality in the developing world results from and contributes to extreme poverty. For example, many African governments spend less than USD$10 per person per year on healthcare, while, in the United States, the federal government spent approximately USD$4,500 per capita in 2000.\nMany diseases are preventable through simple, non-medical methods. For example, research has shown that the simple act of hand washing can prevent many contagious diseases.\nPublic health plays an important role in disease prevention efforts in both the developing world and in developed countries, through local health systems and through international non-governmental organizations, like the International Public Health Forum (IPHF)\nThe two major postgraduate professional degrees related to this field are the Master of Public Health (MPH) or the (much rarer) Doctor of Public Health (DrPH). Many public health researchers hold PhDs in their fields of speciality, while some public health programs confer the equivalent Doctor of Science degree instead. The United States medical residency specialty is General Preventive Medicine and Public Health.\n\n# History of public health\nIn some ways, public health is a modern concept, although it has roots in antiquity. From the beginnings of human civilization, it was recognized that polluted water and lack of proper waste disposal spread communicable diseases (theory of miasma). Early religions attempted to regulate behavior that specifically related to health, from types of food eaten, to regulating certain indulgent behaviors, such as drinking alcohol or sexual relations. The establishment of governments placed responsibility on leaders to develop public health policies and programs in order to gain some understanding of the causes of disease and thus ensure social stability prosperity, and maintain order.\n\n## Early public health interventions\nBy Roman times, it was well understood that proper diversion of human waste was a necessary tenet of public health in urban areas. The Chinese developed the practice of variolation following a smallpox epidemic around 1000 BC. An individual without the disease could gain some measure of immunity against it by inhaling the dried crusts that formed around lesions of infected individuals. Also, children were protected by inoculating a scratch on their forearms with the pus from a lesion. This practice was not documented in the West until the early-1700s, and was used on a very limited basis. The practice of vaccination did not become prevalent until the 1820s, following the work of Edward Jenner to treat smallpox.\nDuring the 14th century Black Death in Europe, it was believed that removing bodies of the dead would further prevent the spread of the bacterial infection. This did little to stem the plague, however, which was most likely spread by rodent-borne fleas. Burning parts of cities resulted in much greater benefit, since it destroyed the rodent infestations. The development of quarantine in the medieval period helped mitigate the effects of other infectious diseases. However, according to Michel Foucault, the plague model of governmentality was later controverted by the cholera model. A Cholera pandemic devastated Europe between 1829 and 1851, and was first fought by the use of what Foucault called \"social medicine\", which focused on flux, circulation of air, location of cemeteries, etc. All those concerns, born of the miasma theory of disease, were mixed with urbanistic concerns for the management of populations, which Foucault designated as the concept of \"biopower\". The German conceptualized this in the Polizeiwissenschaft (\"Science of police\").\nThe science of epidemiology was founded by John Snow's identification of a polluted public water well as the source of an 1854 cholera outbreak in London. Dr. Snow believed in the germ theory of disease as opposed to the prevailing miasma theory. Although miasma theory correctly teaches that disease is a result of poor sanitation, it was based upon the prevailing theory of spontaneous generation. Germ theory developed slowly: despite Anton van Leeuwenhoek's observations of Microorganisms, (which are now known to cause many of the most common infectious diseases) in the year 1680 , the modern era of public health did not begin until the 1880s, with Robert Koch's germ theory and Louis Pasteur's production of artificial vaccines.\nOther public health interventions include latrinization, the building of sewers, the regular collection of garbage followed by incineration or disposal in a landfill, providing clean water and draining standing water to prevent the breeding of mosquitos.\n\n## Modern public health\nAs the prevalence of infectious diseases in the developed world decreased through the 20th century, public health began to put more focus on chronic diseases such as cancer and heart disease.  An emphasis on physical exercise was reintroduced.\nIn America, public health worker Dr. Sara Josephine Baker lowered the infant mortality rate using preventative methods. She established many programs to help the poor in New York City keep their infants healthy. Dr. Baker led teams of nurses into the crowded neighborhoods of Hell's Kitchen and taught mothers how to dress, feed, and bathe their babies. After WWI many states and countries followed her example in order to lower infant mortality rates.\nDuring the 20th century, the dramatic increase in average life span is widely credited to public health achievements, such as vaccination programs and control of infectious diseases, effective safety policies such as motor-vehicle and occupational safety, improved family planning, fluoridation of drinking water, anti-smoking measures, and programs designed to decrease chronic disease.\nMeanwhile, the developing world remained plagued by largely preventable infectious diseases, exacerbated by malnutrition and poverty. Front-page headlines continue to present society with public health issues on a daily basis: emerging infectious diseases such as SARS, making its way from China to Canada and the United States; prescription drug benefits under public programs such as Medicare; the increase of HIV-AIDS among young heterosexual women and its spread in South Africa; the increase of childhood obesity and the concomitant increase in type II diabetes among children; the impact of adolescent pregnancy; and the ongoing social, economic and health disasters related to the 2005 Tsunami and Hurricane Katrina in 2006. These are all ongoing public health challenges.\nSince the 1980s, the growing field of population health has broadened the focus of public health from individual behaviors and risk factors to population-level issues such as inequality, poverty, and education. Modern public health is often concerned with addressing determinants of health across a population, rather than advocating for individual behaviour change. There is a recognition that our health is affected by many factors including where we live, genetics, our income, our educational status and our social relationships - these are known as \"social determinants of health.\" A social gradient in health runs through society, with those that are poorest generally suffering the worst health. However even those in the middle classes will generally have worse health outcomes than those of a higher social stratum (WHO, 2003). The new public health seeks to address these health inequalities by advocating for population-based policies that improve the health of the whole population in an equitable fashion.\nThe burden of treating conditions caused by unemployment, poverty, unfit housing and environmental pollution have been calculated to account for between 16-22% of the clinical budget of the British National Health Service. \nUK Public health functions include:\n- Health surveillance, monitoring and analysis\n- Investigation of disease outbreaks, epidemics and risk to health\n- Establishing, designing and managing health promotion and disease prevention programmes\n- Enabling and empowering communities to promote health and reduce inequalities\n- Creating and sustaining cross-Government and intersectoral partnerships to improve health and reduce inequalities\n- Ensuring compliance with regulations and laws to protect and promote health\n- Developing and maintaining a well-educated and trained, multi-disciplinary public health workforce\n- Ensuring the effective performance of NHS services to meet goals in improving health, preventing disease and reducing inequalities\n- Research, development, evaluation and innovation\n- Quality assuring the public health function\n\n# Public health programs\nToday, most governments recognize the importance of public health programs in reducing the incidence of disease, disability, and the effects of aging, although public health generally receives significantly less government funding compared with medicine. In recent years, public health programs providing vaccinations have made incredible strides in promoting health, including the eradication of smallpox, a disease that plagued humanity for thousands of years.\nOne of the most important public health issues facing the world currently is HIV/AIDS. Tuberculosis, which claimed the lives of authors Franz Kafka and Charlotte Brontë, and composer Franz Schubert, among others, is also reemerging as a major concern due to the rise of HIV/AIDS-related infections and the development of tuberculin strains that are resistant to standard antibiotics.\nAnother major public health concern is diabetes. In 2006, according to the World Health Organization, at least 171 million people worldwide suffered from diabetes. Its incidence is increasing rapidly, and it is estimated that by the year 2030, this number will double.\nA controversial aspect of public health is the control of smoking. Many nations have implemented major initiatives to cut smoking, such as increased taxation and bans on smoking in some or all public places. Proponents argue by presenting evidence that smoking is one of the major killers in all developed countries, and that therefore governments have a duty to reduce the death rate, both through limiting passive (second-hand) smoking and by providing fewer opportunities for smokers to smoke. Opponents say that this undermines individual freedom and personal responsibility (often using the phrase nanny state in the UK), and worry that the state may be emboldened to remove more and more choice in the name of better population health overall. However, proponents counter that inflicting disease on other people via passive smoking is not a human right, and in fact smokers are still free to smoke in their own homes.\n\n# Public Hygiene\nPublic hygiene includes public behaviors individuals can take to improve their personal health and wellness. Topics include public transportation, food preparation and public washroom use. These are steps individuals can take themselves. Examples would include avoiding crowded subways during the flu season, using gloves when touching the handrails and opening doors in public malls as well as going to clean restaurants.\n\n# Economics of public health\nThe application of economics to the realm of public health has been rising in importance since the 1980s. Economic studies can show, for example, where limited public resources might best be spent to save lives or cause the greatest increase in quality of life.\n\n# Research\nPublic health investigates sources of disease and descriptors of health through scientific methodology. This can lead to a public health solution to an epidemic, or a community based intervention for chronic diseases. Either way, research can provide the link between cause and effect for public health issues.\n\n## Community based participatory research\nIn contrast to clinical, patient oriented, or literature review research, community based participatory research (CBPR) investigates community-based etiology, involves community leaders, and overall respects the forces under which the community and its participants preside toward promoting and sustaining public health matters. As described by the WK Kellogg Foundation Community Health Scholars Program, CBPR is a\n\"collaborative approach to research that equitably involves all partners in the research process and recognizes the unique strengths that each brings. CBPR begins with a research topic of importance to the community, has the aim of combining knowledge with action and achieving social change to improve health outcomes and eliminate health disparities.\"\nCBPR methods have been necessary for implementation of certain public health actions. This have been difficult to accomplish because communities in poorer, less well developed areas often distrust researchers and scientists from \"outside.\"\n\n# Academic resources\n- American Journal of Public Health\n- Annual Review of Public Health, ISSN: 15452093 (electronic) 0163-7525 (paper), Annual Reviews\n- Biosecurity and Bioterrorism: Biodefense Strategy, Practice, and Science, ISSN 1538-7135, Mary Ann Lieber\n- Central Asia Health Review, New York based independent magazine\n- International Journal of Prisoner Health, ISSN: 1744-9219 (electronic) 1744-9200 (paper), Taylor & Francis\n- Journal of Health, Population and NutritionISSN: 1606 0997\n- Journal of Public Health Management and Practice, ISSN: 1078-4659, Lippincott William & Wilkins\n- 1468-2869 Journal of Urban Health, ISSN: (electronic) 1099-3460 (paper) , Springer\n- Public Health Nutrition, ISSN: 1475-2727 (electronic) 1368-9800 (paper), Cambridge\n- Public Health Reports, ISSN: 0033-3549\n- Scandinavian Journal of Public Health,  ISSN:  1651-1905 (electronic) 1403-4948 (paper), Informa Healthcare\n- The European Journal of Public Health, ISSN: 1464-360X (electronic) 1101-1262 (paper), Oxford University Press\n- The Journal of Infectious Diseases, ISSN: 0022-1899, The University of Chicago Press", "source": "wikidoc", "question": "According to authoritative guidelines on public health, discuss how a national public‑health agency should prioritize and design population‑level interventions to prevent disease and reduce health inequalities in a low‑resource setting, addressing (with justification) choices about surveillance and outbreak investigation, prevention versus treatment strategies, workforce development, intersectoral partnerships and community engagement, regulatory measures, and the economic considerations that should inform resource allocation."}
{"guideline_text": "Filter (water)\n\n# Overview\nA water filter is a device which removes impurities from water by means of a fine physical barrier, chemical process and/or biological process.  Filters are used to cleanse water for irrigation, drinking water, aquariums, and swimming pools.\n\n# Uses\nWater can be cleaned using a variety of different types of water filters, both for drinking and other purposes. Filtration forms a key stage in many waste water and drinking water treatement systems. In the case of drinking water, filtration tends to be carried out by the supplier prior to the water's entry into the distribution system. Additional filtration may be carried out by consumers at their premises using any of several types of domestic water filter.\nDomestic water filters are primarily used to remove chemicals and metals such as chlorine and lead.  Water filters can be used for preventative health reasons in the case of harmful substances, or for reasons of aesthetics, to improve the taste, colour or odour of drinking water. Domestic water filters can be attached directly to a tap, attached to the domestic water supply before the tap, or filters can be used at the point of use or in a portable unit.\n\n# Methods of filtration\nThe physics of water filters is based on sieving, adsorption, ion exchanges and other processes. Unlike a sieve or screen, a filter can remove particles much smaller than the holes through which the water passes.\n\n# Types of filters\n\n## Water treatment plant filters\nTypes of water filters include media filters, screen filters, disk filters, slow sand filter beds, rapid sand filters and cloth filters.\n\n## Point-of-use/domestic drinking water filters\nA number of different filter types are available for use in the home, including granular activated carbon filters (GAC), metallic alloy filters, microporous ceramic filters, carbon block resin (CBR) and ultra-filtration membranes. Some filter units may be composite systems comprising several of these filter technologies. Jug filters can be used for small quantities of water for drinking. Some kettles have such filters built in, predominantly to reduce the effects of limescale.\n\n## Portable water filters\nWater filters are also used by recreational hikers, by aid organizations during humanitarian emergencies, and by the military.  These filters are usually small, portable and light (1-2 pounds or less) and usually filter water by working a mechanical hand pump, although some use a siphon drip system to force water through while others are built right into water bottles.  Dirty water is pumped via a screen-filtered flexible silicon tube through a specialized filter, ending up in a container.  These types of filters work to remove bacteria, protozoa and microbial cysts, all of which can cause disease.  Filters include fine meshes, which must be replaced, and ceramic water filters which must have their outside abraded off when it becomes clogged with impurities.\nThese water filters should not be confused with devices or tablets that are water purifiers. Some of these devices have the ability to remove or kill viruses such as hepatitis A and rotavirus.", "source": "wikidoc", "question": "According to authoritative guidelines, discuss how you would advise (a) a household seeking a point‑of‑use/domestic drinking-water filter and (b) a recreational hiker needing a portable filter — addressing recommended filter types, mechanisms of action, which contaminants each removes or does not remove (including viruses), appropriate uses and settings, and key maintenance/replacement considerations."}

{"guideline_text": "Hemoperitoneum\nSynonyms and Keywords: peritonel hemorrhage, Hemorrhage into peritoneal cavity, Intraperitoneal hemorrhage, Intraabdominal hemorrhage, abdominal apoplexy, blood in the belly.\n\n# Overview\nHemoperitoneum is accumulation of blood in the peritoneal cavity.  The parietal peritoneum is a thin membrane surrounding the outer abdominal wall, and visceral peritoneum is the thin membrane surrounding the viscera or organs in the abdomen in a bag like manner. The space between these two membranes is called the peritoneal cavity. The most common cause is trauma. Hemoperitoneum is a life-threatening condition that requires prompt medical attention.  Early detection and rapid treatment remain critical to a favorable result. Careful observation may be allowed under some circumstances. The abdominal cavity has the capacity to store more than 5 liters of blood, which can build quickly and cause hemorrhagic shock. If left untreated it may lead to death.\n\n# Historical Perspective\n- In 1909, Barber first described hemoperitoneum and coined the term \"abdominal apoplexy\".\n- Earlier such cases were divided according to age into differing causes. Patients younger than 45 years old are thought to have congenital aneurysms of the vertebral arteries, but those older than 45 years old are thought to have less well-defined etiology (but causes perhaps related to hypertension and atherosclerosis).\n- In 1987, as per Sanderson's study, only 51 occurrences of spontaneous peritoneal hemorrhage had been documented, with 38% of the cases having no identified bleeding site.\n- The male-to-female ratio was 3:2, with the majority of cases affecting those between the ages of 55 and 64.\n- The typical presentation was with nonspecific abdominal symptoms progressing to an acute abdomen, although cases have also been recorded as presenting as cardiovascular collapse.\n\n# Classification\nHemoperitoneum can be classified into 3 types depending on its cause.\n\n# Pathophysiology\nThe presence of blood in the peritoneal cavity is known as hemoperitoneum. The area between the inner lining of the abdominal wall and the internal abdominal organs becomes clogged with blood. Hemoperitoneum is considered a surgical emergency in most cases. In selected cases observation under direct supervision of medical staff can be one of the options.\nThe abdominal cavity in human body is highly distensible, and it can readily accommodate with over five liters of blood, or more than an ordinary person's full circulating blood volume. As a result, large-scale or sudden blood loss into the abdomen will almost always result in hemorrhagic shock, which can quickly lead to death if left untreated.\nPatients could be classified into one of three groups based on the intensity and cause of their bleeding:\n- Trauma to the abdomen caused by blunt force (such as the bat hitting or during the fights hitting fist in the stomach)\n- The abdomen has been pierced by a piercing trauma.\n- Organ injuries, such as those to the spleen, liver, or pancreatic\nA normal blood artery is adjacent to an inflammatory condition or tumor, it might deteriorate or produce a pseudoaneurysm, resulting in hemoperitoneum. Rupture pseudoaneurysm is more common in pancreatitis and Intraabdominal varices caused by liver cirrhosis and portal hypertension are the most common cause of venous rupture.\nThe most common of them is warfarin anticoagulation, while hematoma of the psoas or rectus muscles is the most common complication of warfarin usage.\n\n# Causes\nInjury to intraabdominal organ or vessel with any of the underlying conditions: \n- Blunt abdominal trauma, which results in rupture of liver, kidney, spleen or mesenteric vessels. Sometimes displaced pelvic fractures can  lacerate the  pelvic or iliac arteries, causing hemoperitoneum.\n- Highly vascular intraabdominal tumors can lead to spontaneous bleeding or by invasion of blood vessels.\n- Iatrogenic bleeding during abdominal surgery (particularly intestinal anastomosis and resection or enterotomy  ) or intraabdominal organ biopsy (kidney, spleen or liver).\n- Parturition or late-term pregnancy can cause uterine or ovarian artery rupture.\n- Gynecologic disorders ruptured\n-varian cyst or ruptured corpus luteum\nuterine rupture\nectopic pregnancy rupture\n- ovarian cyst or ruptured corpus luteum\n- uterine rupture\n- ectopic pregnancy rupture\n- Coagulopathy can cause spontaneous hemoabdomen on rare occasions.\n- Umbilical vessel rupture inside the abdomen in neonates.\n- Acute cholecystitis eroding the cystic artery\n- Ruprure of renal or hepatic cyst\n- Peritoneal membrane abnormalities\nRadiation injury\nPeritoneal calcification\nSclerosing peritonitis\nPeritoneal carcinomatosis\n- Radiation injury\n- Peritoneal calcification\n- Sclerosing peritonitis\n- Peritoneal carcinomatosis\n- IgA nephropathy\n- Bleeding due to a perforated gastric ulcer\n- Aortic or other vascular rupture\n- Acute hemorrhagic pancreatitis\n- Hepatic hematoma in syndromic hemolysis with elevated liver enzymes and low platelet count (HELLP syndrome)\n\n# Differential diagnosis of hemoperitoneum\nThe common conditions which present similar to hemoperitoneum are:\n\n# Epidemiology and Demographics\nHemoperitonium also known as Bloody peritoneal dialysate is common in peritoneal dialysis patients, ranging from 6% overall to 57 percent in premenopausal women. Peritoneal dialysate usually relates to the peritoneal dialysis procedure or relates to underlying kidney disease such as PKD or acquired cystic diseases or the multiple factors unrelated to kidney diseaseLike catheter implantation related, gynecological related (retrograde menstruation, endometriosis, after ovarian cyst), catheter related trauma (exercise related) or coagulopathy related. Peritoneal dialysis exchanges helps him assessing the peritoneal cavity and early detection of blood in the peritoneum that could be related to benign causes of bleeding or it can be simply a silent bleed in peritoneal cavity.\nIn a study done with a goal to correlate hemoperitoneum to a variety of causes. A total of 424 individuals were enrolled in the clinical trial, and only 6% of them suffered one or more episodes of bloody peritoneal dialysis (hemoperitoneum). Patients were split into many categories in the setting based on the severity and cause of bleeding:\n- In most of the patient's or in most of the groups, the bleeding was mild and asymptomatic with pink to reddish discoloration of peritoneal fluid.\n- Minor bleeding was found in only 1 patient with underlying pancreatitis or sclerosing peritonitis on the other hand svere bleeding that required intervention was observed in 6-8 patient's having underlying ovarian cyst rupture\n- Only a single increase was observed related to peritoneal bleeding following transplant nephrectomy, catheter repositioning, enhanced physical activity and or neural hematoma.\nOver 50% of menstrual women on peritoneal dialysis develop benign hemoperitoneum, which is most likely caused by ovulation, endometriosis or retrograde menstruation.\nIt's worth noting that a very small amount of blood (less than 1 mL) is adequate to tint 2 liters of peritoneal dialysate.\nIn 5% of cases, bleeding into the peritoneal cavity occurs after the peritoneal catheter is inserted\n\n# Risk Factors\nA person having underlying conditions is more prone to spontaneous hemoperitoneum\n- Highly vascular intra-abdominal tumors\n- Aneurysm or pseudoaneurysm of intrabdominal vessels\n- Coagulation disorders\n- HELLP syndrome\n- Gastric ulcer\n- Endometriosis\n- Difficult labour\n- Anticoagulation therapy\n- Iatrogenic eg. colonoscopy\n- Meckel's diverticulum\n\n# Natural History, Complications, and Prognosis\nIf hemoperitoneum is not treated immediately, severe complications might occur. The peritoneal cavity is unusual in that it can store nearly all of a person's circulating blood volume. The blood can collect quickly in the peritoneal cavity.\nThis can lead to shock due to blood loss, make you unconscious, and even cause death.\nPrognosis varies depending on the underlying etiology and associated injuries.\n\n# Diagnosis\nThe various methods of diagnosing hemoperitoneum are:\n- Ultrasound: An ultrasound is a process that uses sound waves to create pictures of the inside of the body.  The presence of fluid or blood in the peritoneal cavity can be detected using ultrasounds.  For example, Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma (FAST).  FAST is used for the quick diagnosis of blood in the peritoneal cavity but does not tell anything about the source of bleeding\n- CT Scan: The term CT scan (also known as CAT scan) refers to computerized axial tomography (CT scan). This method creates cross-sectional x-rays of the interior of the body and can aid in the detection of blood or fluid in the peritoneal cavity. It is used in hemodynamically stable patients.  It is used for the determination of solid organ injury and to find the source of bleeding.\n- MRI: The term \"magnetic resonance imaging\" refers to the use of magnetic and radio waves to create pictures of the inside of the body, which can aid in the diagnosis of hemoperitoneum.\n- Paracentesis or diagnostic peritoneal lavage: It is a surgical diagnostic technique used to see if there is any free-floating fluid in the abdominal cavity.\n- Diagnostic laparoscopy or exploratory laparotomy: Laparoscopy is a procedure that uses tiny incisions and a camera to examine the abdomen or pelvis. With a few tiny cuts in the belly, the laparoscope assists therapeutic or diagnostic treatments.\n- Exploratory laparotomy: The abdomen is opened and the abdominal organs are inspected for damage or illness during an exploratory laparotomy. It is the standard of treatment in a variety of blunt and penetrating trauma scenarios when numerous life-threatening injuries may exist, as well as in many diagnostic cases where the operation is performed to find a unifying reason for several signs and symptoms of illness.\n\n## Signs and Symptoms\nIt is difficult to detect signs and symptoms of internal bleeding unless there is a severe trauma or accident that necessitates a hospital visit. Vital indicators like blood pressure and heart rate, may vary considerably from case to instance.  Internal bleeding in the abdominal or pelvic area may progress to symptoms of shock. Signs and symptoms of hemoperitoneum are:\n- Nausea or vomiting\n- Light headedness\n- Tenderness at the site of abdomen\n- Stabbing or sharp pain\n- Cold and clammy extremities\n- Dizziness or confusion\n\n## Physical Examination\nOn physical examination numerous signs ans symptoms can be appreciated:\n- Hypotension, tachycardia, shock\n- Abdominal pain or tenderness\n- Abdominal deformity, abrasion, contusion\n- Absent or decreased bowel sounds\n- Hemorrhagic pancreatitis\nDiagnostic signs\n- Cullen's sign: periumbilical bruising\n- Grey turner's sign: discoloration around the flanks\n- Danforth sign: On inspiration there is shoulder pain\n- Kehr's sign: left shoulder pain on supine or pressure applied to Left Upper Quadrant\n- Prominent veins on the abdominal wall in portal hypertension\n\n## Laboratory Findings\nSerum labs\n- Complete blood count:  To evaluate the need for transfusion.\n- Blood type and crossmatch\nInvasive studies:\n- Diagnostic peritoneal lavage (abdominal paracentesis)  : Rapid method to determine blood in the peritoneal cavity.\nUsed in hemodynamically unstable patients when FAST exam is not possible.\n\n## Electrocardiogram\nAn ECG may be helpful in the diagnosis of hemoperitoneum. If a patient presents with shock due to massive intra peritoneal bleeding then the EKG may show sinus tachycardia.\n\n## X-ray\nIf the hemoperitoneum is due to perforation of any hollow visceral organ, then it may show air under the diaphragm.\n\n# Treatment\nThe main goals of treatment for hemoperitoneum are arrest of bleeding, the preservation and restoration of effective blood volume, and the restoration and maintenance of oxygen carrying capacity.\nThe options to achieve these goals are fluid resuscitation, the delivery of blood products or hemoglobin-based oxygen carriers, abdominal counterpressure, and surgical intervention.\nBleeding intra-abdominal neoplasms almost always necessitate surgery. Hemorrhaging patients with splenic torsion, liver lobe torsion, bleeding cysts, penetrating injuries, stomach dilatation and volvulus, and any other condition leading in organ ischemia should have emergency surgery.\nThe initial treatment for large hemoperitoneum is an urgent blood transfusion if the patient is in hemorrhagic shock.\nHemoperitoneum treatment include both the evacuation of blood from the peritoneal cavity and the cessation of bleeding.\nHemoperitoneum is a sign that emergent surgery is needed to find the cause of the bleeding as well as to recover spilled blood from the peritoneal cavity and utilize it for auto-transfusion if it isn't polluted by burst bowel contents.\nThe control method is determined by the cause of blood loss.\n- Clamping and ligation of the offending artery, or repair of the vessel, would be used to treat vascular bleeding.\n- Removal of spleen or splenectomy is required for bleeding from the spleen. Low-grade lacerations of slpeen may be observed until clinical condition deteriorates.\n- Application of thrombin, hemostatic sponges or argon beam cauterization is required to control bleeding from the liver.\n- Endovascular technique is used for the repair of ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm.\nMethods of treatment for hemoperitoneum\n\n## Prevention\nThere are no established measures for the primary prevention of .\nOR\nThere are no available vaccines against .\nOR\nEffective measures for the primary prevention of  include , , and .\nOR\n vaccine is recommended for  to prevent .

{"guideline_text": "Rectal\n\n# Overview\nThe rectum (from the Latin rectum intestinum, meaning straight intestine) is the final straight portion of the large intestine in some mammals, and the gut in others, terminating in the anus. The human rectum is about 12 cm long. At its commencement its caliber is similar to that of the sigmoid colon, but near its termination it is dilated, forming the rectal ampulla.\n\n# Role in human defecation\nThe rectum intestinum acts as a temporary storage facility for feces. As the rectal walls expand due to the materials filling it from within, stretch receptors from the nervous system located in the rectal walls stimulate the desire to defecate. If the urge is not acted upon, the material in the rectum is often returned to the colon where more water is absorbed. If defecation is delayed for a prolonged period, constipation and hardened feces results.\nWhen the rectum becomes full the increase in intrarectal pressure forces the walls of the anal canal apart allowing the fecal matter to enter the canal. The rectum shortens as material is forced into the anal canal and peristaltic waves propel the feces out of the rectum. The internal and external sphincter allow the faeces to be passed by muscles pulling the anus up over the exiting feces.\n\n# Medical procedures\nFor the diagnosis of certain ailments, a rectal exam may be done.\nSuppositories may be inserted into the rectum as a route of administration for medicine.\nThe endoscopic procedures colonoscopy and sigmoidoscopy are performed to diagnose diseases such as cancer.\n\n## Temperature taking\nBody temperature can also be taken in the rectum. Rectal temperature can be taken by inserting a mercury thermometer for 3 to 5 minutes, or a digital thermometer until it \"beeps\", not more than 25 mm (1 inch) into the rectum via the anus. Due to recent concerns related to mercury poisoning, the use of mercury thermometers is now discouraged. Normal rectal temperature generally ranges from 36 to 38 °C (97.6 to 100.4 °F) and is about 0.5 °C (1 °F) above oral (mouth) temperature and about 1 °C (2 °F) above axillary (armpit) temperature.\nMany pediatricians recommend that parents take infants and toddler's temperature in the rectum for two reasons:\n- (1) Rectal temperature is the closest to core body temperature and in children that young, accuracy is critical.\n- (2) Younger children are unable to cooperate when having their temperature taken by mouth (oral) which is recommended for children, ages 6 and above and for adults.\nIn recent years, the introduction of ear (tympanic) thermometers and changing attitudes on privacy and modesty have led some parents and doctors to discontinue taking rectal temperatures.\n\n# Sexual stimulation\nDue to the proximity of the anterior wall of the rectum to the vagina in females or to the prostate in males and the shared nerves thereof, rectal stimulation or penetration can result in sexual arousal.

{"guideline_text": "Primary peritoneal cancer\nSynonyms and keywords: Primary peritoneal neoplasm; Primary peritoneal serous carcinoma; Primary peritoneal malignancy; Primary peritoneal tumors; Serous surface papillary carcinoma; Primary peritoneal carcinoma; Extra-ovarian serous carcinoma; Primary serous papillary carcinoma; Psammomacarcinoma\n\n# Overview\nPrimary peritoneal cancer is a cancer of the cells lining the peritoneum or abdominal cavity. It is indistinguishable histologically from primary epithelial ovarian carcinoma: serous type. Precise causes are unknown, link with certain variants of BRCA 1 and BRCA 2 mutation has been described. Primary peritoneal cancer commonly affects females more than males, older than 30 years of age (mean age of diagnosis is 67 years old) and Caucasian Americans are noted to be more affected than African Americans. Diagnostics involves immunohistochemistry, imaging and tissue biopsy. Surgical debulking is the primary treatment for extra-ovarian primary peritoneal carcinoma. Staging is usually done intraoperatively. Chemotherapy is done after optimal tumor debulking.\n\n# Pathophysiology\n- Primary peritoneal cancer is a cancer of the cells lining the peritoneum or abdominal cavity.\n- They are histologically indistinguishable from primary serous ovarian carcinoma.\n- Some studies indicate that between 7 to 20 percent of initially diagnosed epithelial ovarian cancers could be properly reclassified as primary peritoneal cancers.\n- Primary serous ovarian carcinoma and primary peritoneal carcinoma share the same molecular alterations. This involves mutations in the TP53 gene which produces abnormal P53 proteins.\n\n# Classification\n- Primary peritoneal neoplasms comprise of an uncommon group of heterogeneous entities that include:\nMesothelial derivatives:\nPrimary (malignant) peritoneal mesothelioma\nPrimary peritoneal multicystic mesothelioma\nPrimary peritoneal well differentiated papillary mesothelioma\nPrimary peritoneal adenomatoid tumor\nEpithelial derivatives:\nPrimary peritoneal serous carcinoma / primary peritoneal papillary serous carcinoma\nPrimary peritoneal serous borderline tumor\nSmooth muscle cell derivatives\nDiffuse peritoneal leiomyomatosis (leiomyomatosis peritonialis disseminata)\nOthers\nDesmoplastic small round cell tumor arising from the peritoneum\nSolitary fibrous tumor arising the abdomen/peritoneum\nPeritoneal lymphangioma\n- Mesothelial derivatives:\nPrimary (malignant) peritoneal mesothelioma\nPrimary peritoneal multicystic mesothelioma\nPrimary peritoneal well differentiated papillary mesothelioma\nPrimary peritoneal adenomatoid tumor\n- Primary (malignant) peritoneal mesothelioma\n- Primary peritoneal multicystic mesothelioma\n- Primary peritoneal well differentiated papillary mesothelioma\n- Primary peritoneal adenomatoid tumor\n- Epithelial derivatives:\nPrimary peritoneal serous carcinoma / primary peritoneal papillary serous carcinoma\nPrimary peritoneal serous borderline tumor\nSmooth muscle cell derivatives\nDiffuse peritoneal leiomyomatosis (leiomyomatosis peritonialis disseminata)\n- Primary peritoneal serous carcinoma / primary peritoneal papillary serous carcinoma\n- Primary peritoneal serous borderline tumor\n- Smooth muscle cell derivatives\n- Diffuse peritoneal leiomyomatosis (leiomyomatosis peritonialis disseminata)\n- Others\nDesmoplastic small round cell tumor arising from the peritoneum\nSolitary fibrous tumor arising the abdomen/peritoneum\nPeritoneal lymphangioma\n- Desmoplastic small round cell tumor arising from the peritoneum\n- Solitary fibrous tumor arising the abdomen/peritoneum\n- Peritoneal lymphangioma\n\n## Embryological Basis of Pathogenesis\n- Ovarian and peritoneal epithelium share common embryonal origin, which is the coelomic epithelium. Coelomic epithelium is thought to be of mesonephric origin. With the overall point being that normal ovarian and peritoneal tissue is derived from the mesonephros. On the contrary, fallopian tube epithelium, endometrium, and endocervix are related to paramesonephros (Müllerian duct). Surprisingly, epithelial ovarian cancer and primary peritoneal cancer are histologically similar to the mullerian epithelium; not their embryonal origin, the mesonephros. This observation suggests that either a metaplasia has occurred or Mullerian remnants have been left behind in coelomic epithelium, which has turned oncogenic.\n- Newer studies have identified WT1 as a marker differentiating uterine papillary serous carcinoma from the uterus to primary peritoneal carcinoma and papillary serous carcinoma of the ovaries.\n\n## Genetics\n- Although the precise cause is unknown, a link with certain variants of BRCA1 and BRCA 2 mutation has been described.

{"guideline_text": "Pannexin\nPannexins (from Greek 'παν' — all, and from Latin 'nexus' — connection) are a family of vertebrate proteins identified by their homology to the invertebrate innexins. While innexins are responsible for forming gap junctions in invertebrates, the pannexins have been shown to predominantly exist as large transmembrane channels connecting the intracellular and extracellular space, allowing the passage of ions and small molecules between these compartments (such as ATP and sulforhodamine B).\nThree pannexins have been described in Chordates: Panx1, Panx2 and Panx3.\n\n# Function\nPannexin 1 has been shown to be involved in early stages of innate immunity through an interaction with the P2X7 purinergic receptor.  Activation of the pannexin channel through binding of ATP to P2X7 receptor leads to the release of interleukin-1β.\nHypothetical roles of pannexins in the nervous system include participating in sensory processing, synchronization between hippocampus and cortex, hippocampal plasticity, and propagation of calcium waves. Calcium waves are supported by glial cells, which help maintain and modulate neuronal metabolism.  According to one of the hypotheses, pannexins also may participate in pathological reactions, including the neural damage after ischemia and subsequent cell death.\nPannexin 1 channels are pathways for release of ATP from cells.\n\n# Relationship to connexins\nIntercellular gap junctions in vertebrates, including humans, are formed by the connexin family of proteins. Structurally, pannexins and connexins are very similar, consisting of 4 transmembrane domains, 2 extracellular and 1 intracellular loop, along with intracellular N- and C-terminal tails. Despite this shared topology, the protein families do not share enough sequence similarity to confidently infer common ancestry.\n\n# Clinical significance\nTruncating mutations in pannexin 1 have been shown to promote breast and colon cancer metastasis to the lungs by allowing cancer cells to survive mechanical stretch in the microcirculation through the release of ATP.\nPannexins may be involved in the process of tumor development. Particularly, PANX2 expression levels predict post diagnosis survival for patients with glial tumors.\nProbenecid, a well-established drug for the treatment of gout, allows for discrimination between channels formed by connexins and pannexins. Probenecid did not affect channels formed by connexins.", "source": "wikidoc", "question": "According to authoritative guidelines, discuss the molecular functions of pannexin 1 (including its role in ATP release and interaction with P2X7), its hypothesized contributions to nervous system physiology and pathology, and the clinical implications—particularly its associations with cancer metastasis and how probenecid’s differential effect on pannexin versus connexin channels might inform diagnostic or therapeutic strategies."}
{"guideline_text": "Hormone replacement therapy (female-to-male)\nHormone replacement therapy (HRT) for transgender and transsexual people replaces the hormones naturally occurring in their bodies with those of the other sex. However, not all cases of hormone replacement therapy are used by transgendered people. Some reasons for this include men who wish to have a hair-free body, as a result of less of the testosterone, androgens in their body. Its purpose is to cause the development of the secondary sex characteristics of the desired gender. It can not undo the changes produced by the first natural occurring puberty of transgender people, this is done by sexual reassignment surgery and for transwomen by epilation. Some intersex people also receive HRT, either starting in childhood to confirm the gender they were assigned, or later, if this assignment has proven to be incorrect.\nWhile some argue that hormonal therapy does not truly masculinize or feminize, the question is one of definitions. If by masculinize and feminize one means to completely reproduce the male or female biological state, that cannot be done with current medical or surgical therapy. However, the goal of HRT, and indeed all somatic treatments, is to provide patients with a more satisfying body that is more congruent with their true psychological gender identity. It should be noted that the effects of hormonal therapy are often much more satisfying to transgender men than transgender women. It is easier to produce secondary male sexual characteristics with androgens than it is to rid transgender women of those established characteristics.\n\n# Formal requirements for HRT\nThe requirements for hormone replacement therapy vary immensely, often at least a certain time of psychological counselling is required, and so is a time of living in the desired gender role, if that is at all possible, in order to assure that they can psychologically function in that gender role. This period is sometimes called the Real Life Experience (RLE). See also Standards of care for gender identity disorders.\nSome individuals choose to self-administer their medication (\"do-it-yourself\"), often because available doctors have too little experience in this matter, or no doctor is available in the first place. Sometimes, trans persons choose to self-administer because their doctor will not prescribe hormones without a letter from the patient's therapist stating that the patient meets the diagnostic criteria for GID and is making an informed decision to transition. Many therapists require at least 3 months of continuous psychotherapy and/or a real life test in order to write such a letter as is suggested in the HBIGDA Standards of Care. In these circumstances, the individual may self-administer until they can get these authorizations, feeling that they shouldn't have to wait for a medical professional to be convinced of their situation. In addition, as many individuals must pay for evaluation and care out-of-pocket, expense can also be prohibitive to pursuing such therapy.\nHowever, self-administration of hormones is potentially dangerous. Individuals seeking physicians who are knowledgeable and willing to treat transgender patients may wish to consult transgender support groups or a directory of LGBT-friendly doctors, in the USA for example the Gay and Lesbian Medical Association's referral service at GLMA.org.\n\n# Changes established at puberty\nA number of skeletal and cartilaginous changes take place after the onset of puberty at various rates and times. Sometime in the late teen years epiphyseal clusure (in other words, the ends of bones are fused closed) takes place and the length of bones is fixed for life.  Consequently total height and the length of arms, legs, hands, and feet are not affected by HRT.  However, details of bone shape change throughout life, bones becoming heavier and more deeply sculptured under the influence of testosterone.  Many of these differences are described in the Desmond Morris book Manwatching.\n- Pelvis:  The pelvis in females tends to be wider than in males and tilted forward; the pelvis in males tends to be more circular and tilted upwards.\n- Hands:  Male hands and feet tend to be larger than female hands and feet in persons of equal height.\n- Upper Arm:  The upper arm in females tends to be significantly longer (about 1\") than in males of the same height.\n- Head:  Females tend to have smaller heads than males of the same height.\n- Chest:  Female ribcages tend to be narrower than those of males in the same height.\nFacial changes develop gradually over time, and sexual dimorphism (physical difference between the sexes) tends to increase with age.  Within a population of similar body size and ethnicity:\n- Brow:  Males tend to develop heavier bony brows than females.\n- Cheeks:  Female cheeks tend to be fuller and more rounded.  Under the influence of estrogen, fat is deposited beneath the skin and overall facial and body contours become softer.\n- Nose:  The tips of the nasal bones tend to grow more in males than females, creating a larger (longer or wider) nose.\n- Jaw:  The jaw in males tends to grow wider and more deeply sculptured than in females.\n- Larynx: At puberty, the bones and cartilage of the voicebox tend to enlarge less in females than males.  In some males, the larynx becomes visible as a bony \"adam's apple.\"\n- Lips:  Females tend to have thicker, fleshier lips than males of the same size.\n\n# Changes\nFor transmen, taking androgens (i.e. testosterone) causes reversible and irreversible changes.\n\n## Irreversible changes\n- deepening of the voice,\n- growth of facial and body hair,\n- male pattern baldness (in some individuals),\n- an enlargement of the clitoris,\n- growth spurt and closure of growth plates if given before the end of puberty, and\n- possible shrinking and/or softening of breasts, although this is due to changes in fat tissue.\n\n## Reversible changes\n- increased libido,\n- redistribution of body fat,\n- cessation of ovulation and menstruation,\n- further muscle development (especially upper body),\n- increased sweat and changes in body odor,\n- prominence of veins and coarser skin,\n- acne (especially in the first few years of therapy),\n- alterations in blood lipids (cholesterol and triglycerides), and\n- increased red blood cell count.\nThe psychological changes are harder to define, since HRT is usually the first physical action that takes place when transitioning. This fact alone has a significant psychological impact, which is hard to distinguish from hormonally induced changes. Most transmen report an increase of energy and an increased sex drive. Many also report feeling more confident.\nWhile a high level of testosterone is often associated with an increase in aggression, this is not a noticeable effect in most transmen.  HRT doses of testosterone are much lower than the typical doses taken by steroid-using athletes, and create testosterone levels comparable to those of most non-trans men.  These levels of testosterone have not been proven to cause more aggression than comparable levels of estrogen.  It is assumed that the effect of the start of physical treatment is such a relief, and decreases pre-existing aggression so much, that the overall level of aggression actually decreases.\nSome transmen are unable to pass as men without hormones. The most commonly cited reason for this is that their voice may reveal them.\n\n# Contraindications\nSeveral contraindications to androgen therapy exist. An absolute medical contraindication is pregnancy\nRelative medical contraindications are:\n- androgen sensitive epilepsy,\n- migraines,\n- sleep apnea,\n- polycythemia (elevated red blood cell count,)\n- cardiac failure, renal failure, or severe hypertension susceptible to salt retention and fluid overload\n- significant liver disease\n- coronary artery disease or risk factors for CAD\n- history of uterine cancer\n- bleeding disorders (for injected testosterone)\n- significant history of violent behavior\n- history of breast cancer (testosterone has anti-proliferative effects on most but not all breast cancers)\n\n# Types of androgen therapy\nThe half-life of testosterone in blood is about 70 minutes, so it is necessary to have a continuous supply of the hormone for masculinization.\n\n## Injected\n'Depot' drug formulations are created by mixing a substance with the drug that slows its release and prolongs the action of the drug. The two primarily used forms in the US are the testosterone esters testosterone cypionate (Depo-Testosterone) and testosterone enanthate (Delatestryl) which are almost interchangeable. Enanthate is purported to be slightly better with respect to even testosterone release, but this is probably more of a concern for bodybuilders who use the drugs at higher doses (250-1000 mg/week) than the replacement doses used by transgender men (50-100mg/week.) They are mixed with different oils, so some individuals may tolerate one better than the other. Enanthate costs more than cypionate and is more typically the one prescribed for hypogonadal males in the US. Cypionate is more popular in the US than elsewhere (especially amongst bodybuilders.) Other formulations exist but are more difficult to come by in the US. Sustanon is a formulation that mixes shorter acting and longer acting testosterone preparations that gives more even levels of testosterone with injections given every three weeks. A newly marketed formulation of injected testosterone available in Europe, Nebido (testosterone undecanoate in oil) provides significantly improved testosterone delivery with far less variation outside the eugonadal range than other formulations with injections required only four times yearly. However, each quarterly dose requires injection of 4ml which may require multiple simultaneous injections.  Nebido is also much more expensive and currently unavailable in the United States.\nThe adverse side effects of injected testosterone esters are generally associated with high peak levels in the first few days after an injection. Some side effects may be ameliorated by using a shorter dosing interval (weekly or every ten days instead of twice monthly with enanthate or cypionate.) 100 mg weekly gives a much lower peak level of testosterone than does 200 mg every two weeks, while still maintaining the same total dose of androgen. This benefit must be weighed against the discomfort and inconvenience of doubling the number of injections.\nInjected testosterone esters should be started at a low dose and titrated upwards based on trough levels (blood levels drawn just before your next shot.) A trough level of 500 ng/dl is sought. (Normal range for a biological male is  290 to 900 ng/dl.)\n\n## Transdermal\nBoth testosterone patches and gels are available. Both approximate normal physiological levels of testosterone better than the higher peaks associated with injection. Both can cause local skin irritation (more so with the patches.)\nPatches slowly diffuse testosterone through the skin and are replaced daily. The cost varies, as with all medication, from country to country, it is about $150/month in the US, and about 60 Euros in Germany.\nTransdermal testosterone is available in the United States under the brand names Androgel and Testim. Both are absorbed quickly when applied and produce a temporary drug depot in the skin which diffuses into the circulation, peaking at 4 hours and decreasing slowly over the rest of the day. The cost varies, as with all medication, from country to country, it is about $150/month in the US for either brand name drug. However, certain pharmacies are able to compound the drug more cheaply.\nTransdermal testosterone poses a risk of inadvertent exposure to others who come in contact with the patient's skin. This is most important for patients whose intimate partners are pregnant or those who are parents of young children as both of these groups are more vulnerable to the masculinizing effects of androgens. Case reports of significant virilization of young children after exposure to topical androgen preparations (both prescription and 'supplement' products) used by their caregivers demonstrates this very real risk.\n\n## Testosterone pellets\n6-12 pellets are inserted under the skin every three months. This must be done in a physicians office, but is a relatively minor procedure done under local anesthetic. Pellets cost about $20 each, so the cost is greater than injected testosterone when the cost of the physician visit and procedure are included. The primary advantages of Testopel are that it gives a much more constant blood level of testosterone yet requires attention only four times yearly.\n\n## Oral\nNot frequently used in the US, sometimes used in Europe. Once absorbed from the GI tract testosterone is shunted (at very high blood levels) to the liver where it can cause liver damage and worsens some of the adverse effects of testosterone - lower SHBG levels, lower HDL (good) cholesterol. In addition, the ‘first pass’ metabolism of the liver also may result in testosterone levels too low to provide satisfactory masculinization and suppress menses. The safest of the oral formulations is Andriol (testosterone undecanoate) which is not available in the US.\n\n## Sublingual/Buccal\nIn 2003 the FDA approved a buccal form of testosterone (Striant®.) Sublingual testosterone can also be made by some compounding pharmacies. Cost for Striant® is greater than other formulations ($180-210/month.) Testosterone is absorbed through the oral mucosa and avoids the 'first pass metabolism' in the liver which is cause of many of the adverse effect with oral testosterone. The lozenges can cause gum irritation, taste changes, and headache but most side effects diminish after two weeks. The lozenge is 'mucoadhesive' and must be applied twice daily.\n\n# Non-testosterone hormonal therapy\n\n## GnRH agonists\nIn both sexes, the hypothalamus releases GnRH (gonadotropin-releasing hormone) to stimulate the pituitary to produce LH (luteinizing hormone) and FSH (follicle stimulating hormone) which in turn cause the gonads to produce sex steroids. In adolescents of either sex with relevant indicators, GnRH agonists, such as nafarelin can be used to suspend the advance of sex steroid induced, inappropriate pubertal changes for a period without inducing any changes in the gender-appropriate direction. GnRH agonists work by initially over stimulating the pituitary then rapidly desensitizing it to the effects of GnRH. Over a period of weeks, gonadal androgen production is greatly reduced. There is considerable controversy over the earliest age, and for how long it is clinically, morally and legally safe to do this. The Harry Benjamin International Gender Dysphoria Association Standards of Care permit from Tanner Stage 2, but do not allow the addition of gender-appropriate hormones until 16, which could be five or more years. The sex steroids do have important other functions. The high cost of GnRH agonists is often a significant factor.\n\n## Progestin injections\nDepo-Provera (depot medroxyprogesterone acetate, or DMPA) may be injected every three months just as it is used for contraception. Generally after the first cycle, menses are greatly reduced or eliminated. This may be useful for transgender men prior to initiation of testosterone therapy.\n\n## Supplements\nAndro ‘Pro-hormones’: Androstenedione, 4-androstenediol, 5-androstenediol, 19-androstenediol, and 19-norandrostenediol are sold as supplements that are purported to increase serum testosterone, increase muscle mass, decrease fat, elevate mood, and increase sexual performance (i.e. many of the effects transgender men seek with androgen therapy.) However, there is no good medical evidence that the pro-hormones do any of these things. However, there is evidence that ingestion of these substances can cause elevated estrogen levels, and decreases in HDL (good) cholesterol.\n\n# Testosterone effects\n\n## Cardiovascular\n- In biological men, testosterone levels that are either significantly above or below normal are associated with increase cardiovascular risk. This may be causative or simply a correlation.\n- A single retrospective study in the medical literature of 293 transmen treated with testosterone (range of 2 months to 41 years) by the Amsterdam Gender Dysphoria Clinic from 1975 to 1994 showed no increase in cardiovascular mortality or morbidity when compared with the general female Dutch population. (As with all scientific studies, this does not conclusively prove that no causal link exists. A small to moderate detrimental effect remains a possibility, though a very large effect is more unlikely.)\n- Androgen therapy does adversely affect the blood lipid profile by causing decreases in HDL (good) cholesterol, increases in LDL (bad) cholesterol, and increases in triglycerides.\n- Androgen therapy redistributes the fat toward abdominal obesity, which is associated with increased cardiovascular risk rather than fat carried on the buttocks and hips.\n- Androgen therapy can cause weight gain and decreased insulin sensitivity (perhaps worsening a predisposition to develop Type II diabetes.)\n- Androgen therapy effects are not all negative, however. Acutely it causes dilation of the coronary arteries, and in men with testosterone levels within the normal physiological range, higher levels are actually associated with a slight decrease in cardiovascular disease.\n- Supra-physiological levels of androgens (generally due to abuse) are associated with significantly increased risks of strokes and heart attacks (even in the young.) More is not better!\n- Cardiovascular risk factors are more than additive. (If high blood pressure is worth 10 and smoking is worth 10, together they are worth more than 20.) So for transgendered men, the addition of risk with androgen therapy makes improving modifiable risk factors more important.\n- The most important modifiable risk factor for many men is smoking.\n\n## Hair\n- The action of testosterone on hair follicles is mainly due to the more potent androgen, dihydrotestosterone, DHT.\n- With androgen therapy, genetics primarily determines how much hair will develop (and where) as well as whether male pattern baldness will develop.\n- Testosterone is converted (within the cells of the hair follicle's dermal papilla) by 5-alpha reductase to DHT. There are two forms of this enzyme: type 1 and 2. However, type 2 is the form that is important to the development of male pattern baldness. Male pseudohermaphrodites with congenital deficiency of type 2 5-alpha reductase (but functional Type 1) never develop male pattern baldness.\n- Propecia (Finasteride) and Avodart (Dutasteride) are Type-2, 5-a-Reductase inhibitors that work by blocking the conversion of testosterone to DHT. While they will not make facial hair growth that has occurred regress, they may slow or prevent further development of new facial hair. Finasteride is sold as 5mg tablets as ‘Proscar’ which is used to treat prostate enlargement and ‘Propecia’ as 1 mg tablet to treat baldness. The cost of 'Propecia' per mg is significantly higher than 'Proscar' so some patients split tablets into quarters. At the 1-1.25mg/day dose it may also decrease libido.\n- Saw palmetto is a naturally occurring 5-alpha reductase inhibitor which is used by some to treat male pattern baldness and prostate enlargement.\n- Rogaine (Minoxidil – available without a prescription in the US) is a topical preparation of a potent blood pressure medicine. It is sold as 2% and 5% solutions. The 5% solution is not recommended for use by women because it may cause the adverse effect of unwanted facial hair growth in a small percentage of women. It may also cause skin irritation and itching. One ml is applied twice daily to the scalp (predominantly in the areas where hair loss is greatest.) It may take several months to show effects and may cause a slight paradoxical worsening of hair loss initially (that does eventually recover.)\nWith either minoxidil or finasteride the beneficial effect will be lost within months upon ceasing use of product. With either, best results occur when they are started before significant hair loss has occurred.\n\n## Gynecological effects\n- Menses should cease within 5 months of testosterone therapy (often sooner.) If bleeding continues past 5 months, transmen must see a gynecologist.\n- Clitoromegaly occurs, and frequently reaches its apex within 2-3 years of therapy. Sizes generally range from 3-8 cm with 4-5 cm being about average. This is genetically determined, but some physicians advocate topical clitoral testosterone as an adjunct to growth before metaidioplasty. However, this testosterone is absorbed and should be calculated into your total regimen.\n- After long-term androgen therapy, ovaries may develop polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) morphology. (In both PCOS and transgender men there is an up-regulation of testosterone receptors in the ovaries.)\n- Untreated PCOS is associated with a possibly increased risk of endometrial cancer as well as decreased fertility.\n- It is unknown whether the risk of ovarian cancer is increased, decreased or unchanged in transgender men compared to women. It is unlikely to be determined in the near future because ovarian cancer is a relatively rare disease and the population of transgender men is too small to do the appropriate study. However, it has been recommended by some physicians that transgender men have an oophorectomy within 2-5 years of starting androgen therapy due to the possible increased risk. (Note: Testosterone dose can frequently be decreased after oophorectomy.)\n- The risk of endometrial cancer is similarly unknown. However, A high prevalence of endometrial hyperplasia has been noted in a small study of transgender men undergoing hysterectomy. (Futterweit W, and Deligdisch L. “Histopathological effects of exogenously administered testosterone in 19 female to male transsexuals.” J Clin Endo & Metab. 62(1):16-21. 1986.)\nFrequently the first sign of endometrial cancer is bleeding in post-menopausal women. Transgender men who have any bleeding after the cessation of menses with androgen therapy should have an endometrial biopsy (and possibly an ultrasound) done to rule-out endometrial cancer.\n- Some sources recommend endometrial ultrasounds every two years. Testosterone usually causes atrophy of the endometrium. Any transgender man with an endometrium that is not thinned on ultrasound should have a biopsy to evaluate for endometrial cancer and possibly use progesterone to cause sloughing of the endometrium. Vaginal bleeding from progesterone may be emotionally uncomfortable for a transman, but it is preferable to developing endometrial cancer.\n- Until recently, any adult with a uterus/cervix was advised to have a Pap smear yearly. This interval might be increased to every 2-3 years for certain people on the advice of a gynecologist.  However, recent research has linked cervical cancer to a sexually transmitted virus; transmen who have never had vaginal sex may not be at risk.  However, since the long-term effects of testosterone on cervical tissues are not well understood, Pap smears may be considered a general precaution.\n- Some transgender men report a decrease in breast size with androgen therapy. However, no morphological changes were found when this was studied and likely it is due to loss of fat in the breasts.\n- Androgen therapy (and suppression of estrogen production) may cause vaginal atrophy and dryness, which may result in dyspareunia (painful vaginal intercourse.) This can be alleviated with topical estrogen cream.\n- Most transgender men report a significantly increased libido. Some report that this decreases somewhat after several years on testosterone. (Natural testosterone levels peak in women just before ovulation which may account for the mid-cycle increase in libido many women experience.)\n\n## Childbearing\n- As the age at which transgender people begin therapy decreases, retention of reproductive potential becomes more important.\n- If a transgender man has not undergone hysterectomy and oophorectomy, he may regain fertility on cessation of testosterone. With the ovarian changes of long-term androgen therapy, however it may require months of cessation of testosterone and possibly assistive reproductive technology to become pregnant. Testosterone must be withheld for the duration of pregnancy.\n- If a transgender man is planning on having a hysterectomy/oophorectomy, future reproduction may still be preserved by:\nOocyte banking – hormonal stimulation to ‘hyper-ovulate’ with transvaginal oocyte harvest for freezing. Very poor survival of banked oocytes.\nEmbryo banking – oocyte harvest as above with immediate fertilization and banking of the embryo. Much better survival, but the sperm donor must be chosen before oophorectomy.\nOvarian tissue banking – probably the best option. Ovarian tissue is frozen after oophorectomy. Even after long term androgen therapy, ovaries usually retain usable follicles. Eventual use of frozen ovaries will require replantation into the transgender man for stimulation and harvest, but may eventually be possible in a lab as techniques for tissue culture improve.\n- Oocyte banking – hormonal stimulation to ‘hyper-ovulate’ with transvaginal oocyte harvest for freezing. Very poor survival of banked oocytes.\n- Embryo banking – oocyte harvest as above with immediate fertilization and banking of the embryo. Much better survival, but the sperm donor must be chosen before oophorectomy.\n- Ovarian tissue banking – probably the best option. Ovarian tissue is frozen after oophorectomy. Even after long term androgen therapy, ovaries usually retain usable follicles. Eventual use of frozen ovaries will require replantation into the transgender man for stimulation and harvest, but may eventually be possible in a lab as techniques for tissue culture improve.\n\n## Bone\n- Both estrogens and androgens are necessary in both biological males and females for healthy bone. (Young healthy women produce about 10 mg of testosterone monthly. Higher bone mineral density in males is associated with higher serum estrogen.)\n- Bone is not static. It is constantly being reabsorbed and created. Osteoporosis results when bone formation occurs at a rate less than bone reabsorption.\n- Estrogen is the predominant sex hormone that slows bone loss (even in men.)\n- Both estrogen and testosterone help stimulate bone formation (T, especially at puberty.)\n- Testosterone may cause an increase in cortical bone thickness in transgender men (however this does not necessarily translate to a greater mechanical stability.)\n- Transgender men who have been oophorectomized must continue androgen therapy to avoid premature osteoporosis. Estrogen supplementation is theoretically not usually necessary, as some of the injected testosterone will be aromatized into estrogen sufficient to maintain bone (as it does in biological men.) However, a single small study of transmen after oophorectomy demonstrated that androgens alone may be insufficient to retard bone loss. (van Kesteren P, et al. “Long-term follow-up of bone mineral density and bone metabolism in transsexuals treated with cross-sex hormones.” Clin Endocrin. 48(3):347-54. 1998.) It is likely the case that pre-oophorectomy, residual estrogen production is protective. However, after oophorectomy, some transmen may have insufficient estrogen to retard bone loss.\n- Some physicians advocate a Dexa (bone density) scan at the time of oophorectomy and every year or two thereafter to diagnose osteoporosis before it becomes severe enough to be symptomatic. This is important because treatment of osteoporosis is most effective if done early.\n- Daily calcium supplementation and possibly Vitamin D is probably a good idea for most transgender men, but it is even more important after removal of the ovaries.\n\n## Drug interactions\nTestosterone (and all the sex steroids) are metabolized by the Cytochrome P-450 enzyme system in the liver. (Specifically CYP3A.)\nThere are certain drugs that increase or decrease the activity of this enzyme and may cause increased or decreased levels of testosterone and other sex steroids.\n- Cyt P-450 Inducers – May cause decreased levels of testosterone (and other sex steroid) levels: Phenobarbital and Dilantin (seizure medicines,) Rifampin (antibiotic,) and Alcohol!\n- Cyt P-450 Inhibitors – May cause increased levels of testosterone: Serzone, Prozac, Paxil (antidepressants,) Sporanox, Diflucan, and other ‘azole’ antifungals, Tagamet (anti-ulcer agent that can cause gynecomastia in men because of this effect.) Biaxin and other ‘erythromycin type’ antibiotics, Protease Inhibitors (HIV treatment.)\nTestosterone can also alter the effects of other drugs:\n- Increases the blood thinning effect of Coumadin (warfarin.)\n- Decreases the effectiveness of Inderal (propranolol) a blood-pressure medicine.\n- Increases the effect of some oral medicines for diabetes and can cause dangerously low blood sugar levels.\nBecause of these interactions, it is imperative that transmen tell any health care provider that he sees for any reason that he is on androgen therapy (and any other medication or supplement that he takes.)\n\n## Obstructive sleep apnea\n- OSA may be worsened or unmasked by androgen therapy.\n- Risk is greater in transgender men who are obese, smoke, or have COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease.)\n- Untreated OSA may have significant adverse effects on the heart, blood pressure, mood, and may cause headaches and worsen seizure disorders.\n- Symptoms of OSA are noisy sleeping (snoring,) excessive daytime sleepiness, morning headache, personality changes, and problems with judgment, memory, and attention.\n\n## Polycythemia\n- Increased red blood cell mass usually from overproduction by the bone marrow.\n- Testosterone (frequently in large doses) was previously used to treat anemia from bone marrow failure.\n- A transgender man’s hematocrit (the percentage of whole blood made up of red blood cells) should be judged against normal age adjusted values for men.\n- Therapy is via phlebotomy (periodic therapeutic blood draws similar to blood donation.)\n- Tendency to become polycythemic worsens with age.\n- Worse with injected testosterone (especially with longer intervals between doses) than with oral, transdermal, or Testopel. (Increase in RBCs occurs with the very high peaks from injection. So decreasing dose and interval to 7-10 days instead of 14 may help.)\n- Severe polycythemia predisposes to both venous and arterial thrombosis (blood clots) such as: deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, heart attack, and stroke.\n- Aspirin may decrease the risk\n\n## Skin\n- Increased activity of oil and sweat glands.\n- Change in body odor – less sweet and musky, more metallic and acrid.\n- If severe odor is a problem, an antibacterial soap like chlorhexidine may be used in the armpits when showering. After 1-2 weeks of daily use, a noticeable decrease in odor should occur.\n- Acne: generally worse the first few years of testosterone therapy (mimicking a second puberty.) Can be treated with standard acne therapy. Initial treatment is with increased cleansing (at least twice daily) with an anti-acne or oil reducing scrub. If this doesn’t work, additional therapy may be prescribed by a physician.\n- Some physicians see acne as a contraindication to increasing testosterone dose.\n\n## Gastrointestinal\n- There is a risk of liver damage and liver cancer with all testosterone formulations, but this is minimal with all forms except oral or unless very high levels are administered. However, as with any drug that carries even a small risk of liver damage, liver function tests (or at least ALT) should be periodically monitored.\n\n## Neurological/Psychiatric\n- Headaches: Pre-existing migraine headaches can be significantly worsened with androgen therapy. Headaches can also become problematic in men without prior headache disorders.\n- Epilepsy: some seizure disorders are androgen-dependent. These may be worsened or (very rarely) unmasked with androgen therapy.\n- Sleep deprivation worsens almost all seizure disorders, so concurrent obstructive sleep apnea caused or worsened by androgen therapy may also be responsible.\n- Some transgender men report mood swings, increased anger, and increased aggressiveness after starting androgen therapy (similarly to the effects reported with body builders who abuse androgens.) This is much less severe however than the ‘roid rage’ experienced by bodybuilders because with transgender men significantly supraphysiologic levels are not present.\n- Many transgender men, however, report improved mood, decreased emotional lability, and a lessening of anger and aggression. Likely this is not a physiologic effect but rather the alleviation of emotional distress from long-standing gender dysphoria.\n- Recent studies have indicated that cross-hormone therapy in transmen may result in an increase in brain volume towards male proportions.\n\n## Metabolic\n- Testosterone increases body weight (and increases appetite.) The form that this weight gain will take depends on diet and exercise as well as genetic factors. Since testosterone has anabolic effects, gain of lean muscle mass will be easier than it previously was for transgender men. Moderate amounts of exercise will cause greater gains and will ameliorate some of the adverse effects of testosterone.\n- Many transgender men report an increased energy level, decreased need for sleep, and increased alertness after testosterone therapy.\n- In biological men, abnormally high or low levels of testosterone are both associated with insulin resistance (which eventually can result in Type II diabetes.) So mid-normal levels of testosterone are the target for androgen therapy.\n- In women, increased levels of either estrogen or androgens are associated with decreased insulin sensitivity (which may predispose to diabetes.) In a study of transgender males and females, decreased insulin sensitivity was found in both populations after four months or hormonal treatment.

{"guideline_text": "Nikolsky's sign\n\n# Overview\nNikolsky's sign is a clinical dermatological sign in which blisters spread easily upon application of horizontal, tangential pressure to the skin. A positive Nikolsky's sign signifies a separation of epithelial cells either from one another or from the basement membrane, which is a layer of connective tissue to which epithelium usually adhered. This occurs in a number of conditions, including but not limited to the potentially fatal autoimmune skin disorder pemphigus vulgaris, staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis.\nTo check for the presence of these conditions, as well as certain certain vesicular/bullous diseases (conditions that cause skin blisters to form), such as pemphigus and pemphigoid this test can be administered to ascertain the fragility of the epithelial attachment mechanisms.\nOne way to perform this test is with a simply pencil. With the eraser side of a pencil down, the pencil is firmly placed on the skin and depressed while twisted. If the patient has one of a number of vesicular/bullous diseases, he or she will test positive for Nikolsky's sign, and a blister will form within a matter of minutes.\n\n# Histologic Basis for the Sign\nThe idea behind this test lies in the histologic properties of certain vesicular/bullous diseases. In these diseases, there are defects in the cell-to-cell attachement mechanisms, and even minute amounts of trauma can elicit a clinical response of a blister formation when the cells are manually detached with the forceful turn of the pencil eraser on the skin. In the case of pemphigus, the pencil twist easily rips the spinous cells apart because they possess defective desmosomes, and in the case of pemphigoid, the hemidesmosomes are defective. Within minutes, a blister will form, and this is pathognomonic, or absolutely indicative, of a vesicular/bullous disease.\nde:Nikolski-Phänomen\nnl:Teken van Nikolsky", "source": "wikidoc", "question": "According to authoritative guidelines, discuss when and how clinicians should perform and interpret Nikolsky's sign—including its histologic basis, the dermatologic conditions in which a positive sign is expected (and how it aids differential diagnosis such as between pemphigus, pemphigoid, staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis), and the key limitations and safety considerations clinicians must bear in mind when using this test."}
{"guideline_text": "Laparoscopic techniques for hysterectomy\n\n# Guidance\nCurrent evidence on the safety and efficacy of laparoscopic techniques for hysterectomy (including laparoscopically-assisted vaginal hysterectomy , laparoscopic hysterectomy , laparoscopic supracervical hysterectomy  and total laparoscopic hysterectomy ) appears adequate to support their use, provided that normal arrangements are in place for consent, audit and clinical governance.\nClinicians should advise women that there is a higher risk of urinary tract injury and of severe bleeding associated with these procedures, in comparison with open surgery.\nAdvanced laparoscopic skills are required for these procedures, and clinicians should undergo special training and mentorship. The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists has developed an Advanced Training Skills Module, 'Benign Gynaecological Surgery: Laparoscopy'. This would need to be supplemented by further training in order to achieve the skills required for total laparoscopic hysterectomy.# The procedure\n\n# Indications\nHysterectomy is performed for a variety of benign conditions that have not responded to conservative management, including heavy menstrual bleeding, symptomatic uterine fibroids, chronic pelvic pain and uterine prolapse. Hysterectomy is also performed for cancer of the uterus (including cervical cancer) and ovaries.\nA conventional 'open' hysterectomy involves removal of the uterus through an abdominal or a vaginal approach.\n\n# Outline of the procedure\nThis guidance does not cover laparoscopic radical hysterectomy (see 3.1). Under general anaesthesia, small incisions are made in the abdomen to allow insertion of a laparoscope and surgical instruments.\nIn TLH and LSH, the entire procedure is performed laparoscopically, including division of the uterine vessels. In TLH the cervix is removed, while in LSH it is left in situ.\nIn LAVH and LH, part of the operation is performed laparoscopically and part vaginally. Uterine vessel division is performed vaginally in LAVH and laparoscopically in LH.\nIn all of the above procedures, the uterus can be removed either through the open vault of the vagina or one of the abdominal ports.\n\n# Efficacy\nA systematic review and meta-analysis reported that in nine randomised controlled trials (RCTs) including 948 women and comparing laparoscopic techniques for hysterectomy (type not specified) with abdominal hysterectomy (AH), the average length of hospital stay was 2.0 days shorter (95% confidence interval  1.9 to 2.2) in the laparoscopic group.\nThe systematic review and meta-analysis reported that in six RCTs including 520 women and comparing laparoscopic techniques (type not specified) with AH, women in the laparoscopic group returned to normal activities on average 13.6 days earlier (95% CI 11.8 to 15.4) than those in the AH group.\nThe systematic review and meta-analysis reported that in six RCTs including 842 women and comparing laparoscopic techniques (type not specified) with vaginal hysterectomy (VH), there was no significant difference between the techniques in the need for unintended laparotomy (odds ratio  1.55, 95% CI 0.75 to 3.21). In a non-randomised controlled study, conversion to laparotomy was required in 7% (82/1242) of women who underwent laparoscopic procedures.\nOne case series reported conversion to laparotomy in 0.83% (14/1692) of women undergoing LSH. Another case series reported conversion to laparotomy in 2.79% (46/1647) of women who underwent TLH. For more details, refer to the 'Sources of evidence' section. One Specialist Adviser considered laparoscopic techniques for hysterectomy to be established practice and another considered them to be novel and of uncertain efficacy and safety.\nOne Specialist Adviser considered laparoscopic techniques for hysterectomy to be established practice and another considered them to be novel and of uncertain efficacy and safety.\n\n# Safety\nIn a non-randomised controlled study of 37,048 women undergoing hysterectomy, 0/1154 of those treated with laparoscopic techniques for hysterectomy (type not specified) died, but 14 treated with non-laparoscopic techniques died within 6 weeks of the surgery (0.04%, 95% CI 0.025 to 0.064). A non-randomised controlled study of 10,110 women reported that 0.04% (1/2434) of those who underwent laparoscopic procedures (type not specified) died during the convalescence period (not otherwise defined), compared with 0.06% (1/1801) of women who had VH and 0.02% (1/5875) of women who had AH (significance level not stated). The authors stated that the causes of death were alcoholic cirrhosis, cardiac infarct and pulmonary embolism, and were not directly related to the operation.\nThe non-randomised controlled study of 37,048 women reported that the incidence of major operative haemorrhage was significantly higher (p < 0.001) for laparoscopic techniques (4.4%, 51/1154) than for VH (2.0%, 218/11,122) or AH (2.3%, 571/24,772). However, the non-randomised controlled study of 10,110 women reported no significant difference in perioperative haemorrhage between laparoscopic techniques, VH and AH.\nA case series of women undergoing LH reported haemorrhage requiring blood transfusion in 0.3% (5/1648). The case series of women undergoing TLH reported that blood transfusion was required for 0.97% (16/1647).\nThe systematic review and meta-analysis and the non-randomised controlled study of 10,110 women found that the incidence of urinary tract injuries was significantly higher among women who underwent laparoscopic procedures (type not specified) than those who had AH (meta-analysis: OR 2.61, 95% CI 1.22 to 5.60, 10 RCTs, n = 1912; non-randomised study: 1.1% vs 0.2% for ureteric injury and 1.3% vs 0.5% for bladder injury, p < 0.0001). There was no significant difference in the incidence of bowel injury between laparoscopic techniques and AH in either study (meta-analysis: two RCTs, n = 1066; non-randomised study: n = 8309).\nComparing laparoscopic techniques with VH, the meta-analysis found no significant difference for urinary tract injury (six RCTs, n = 805), bowel injury (one RCT, n = 504) or vascular injury (four RCTs, n = 685). Comparing laparoscopic techniques with VH, the non-randomised controlled study reported a higher incidence of injuries to the ureter in the laparoscopic group (1.1% vs 0%) and bladder (1.3% vs 0.2%) (p value not stated for either outcome), but a similar incidence of bowel injury (0.4% vs 0.5%) in the two groups (absolute numbers not provided).\nIn the meta-analysis, there was no significant difference between laparoscopic techniques and AH for vascular injury (two RCTs, n = 956, OR 1.76, 95% CI 0.52 to 5.87).\nThe larger non-randomised controlled study reported that the incidence of visceral damage was higher in women who underwent laparoscopic procedures (1.1%, 13/1154) compared with those who had VH (0.6%, 68/11,122) or AH (0.76%, 189/24,772), but the difference was not significant.\nA case series of 5104 women who underwent laparoscopic procedures (type not specified) reported ureteric injury in 66 women (1.3%), simple bladder injury in 22 (0.4%), vesicovaginal fistula in 12 (0.2%), intestinal injury in 15 (0.3%) and major vascular injury in 1 (0.02%).\nIn a case series of 1405 women undergoing LSH involving electric morcellation of the uterus, adenomyosis was reported in 0.6% (8/1405) of women, all of whom had been treated for symptomatic menorrhagia due to submucosal myomas. Symptoms of the adenomyosis occurred between 2 and 9 years after LSH and included pelvic pain and deep dyspareunia. Laparoscopic surgery was required to make a final diagnosis of the tumours and to remove them. For more details, refer to the 'Sources of evidence' section.\nBoth Specialist Advisers considered special training to be necessary and to have important implications for safety. They considered theoretical adverse events to be injury to the ureter and bowel, vascular injury, haemorrhage and the need for blood transfusion.# Further information\nThe Institute has issued guidance for a number of interventional procedures with the same indications. These include laparoscopic radical hysterectomy for early stage cervical cancer, laparoscopic laser myomectomy, magnetic resonance image-guided percutaneous laser ablation of uterine fibroids, uterine artery embolisation for fibroids, impedance-controlled endometrial ablation for menorrhagia, endometrial cryotherapy for menorrhagia, laparoscopic helium plasma coagulation for the treatment of endometriosis, and microwave, balloon thermal, photodynamic and free fluid thermal endometrial ablation. The Institute has also issued a technology appraisal on fluid-filled thermal balloon and microwave endometrial ablation for menstrual bleeding and a clinical guideline on heavy menstrual bleeding.\nAndrew DillonChief ExecutiveNovember 2007\n\n# Sources of evidence\nThe evidence considered by the Interventional Procedures Advisory Committee is described in the following document.\n'Interventional procedure overview of laparoscopic techniques for hysterectomy', December 2006.\n\n# Information for patients\nNICE has produced information describing its guidance on this procedure for patients and their carers ('Understanding NICE guidance'). It explains the nature of the procedure and the decision made, and has been written with patient consent in mind.# About this guidance\nNICE interventional procedure guidance makes recommendations on the safety and efficacy of the procedure. It does not cover whether or not the NHS should fund a procedure. Funding decisions are taken by local NHS bodies after considering the clinical effectiveness of the procedure and whether it represents value for money for the NHS. It is for healthcare professionals and people using the NHS in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, and is endorsed by Healthcare Improvement Scotland for implementation by NHSScotland.\nThis guidance was developed using the NICE interventional procedure guidance process.\nWe have produced a summary of this guidance for patients and carers. Information about the evidence it is based on is also available.\nChanges since publication\nJanuary 2012: minor maintenance.\nYour responsibility\nThis guidance represents the views of NICE and was arrived at after careful consideration of the available evidence. Healthcare professionals are expected to take it fully into account when exercising their clinical judgement. This guidance does not, however, override the individual responsibility of healthcare professionals to make appropriate decisions in the circumstances of the individual patient, in consultation with the patient and/or guardian or carer.\nImplementation of this guidance is the responsibility of local commissioners and/or providers. Commissioners and providers are reminded that it is their responsibility to implement the guidance, in their local context, in light of their duties to avoid unlawful discrimination and to have regard to promoting equality of opportunity.

{"guideline_text": "Chinese herbology\nChinese materia medica (Template:Zh-stp), is the common name of Chinese materia medica subject. It is the subject which researched knowledge include basic theory of Chinese materia medica and include crude medicine and prepared drug in pieces (Template:Zh-stp) and traditional Chinese patent medicines and simple preparations' source, collection and preparation, performance, efficacy, and clinical application.\nChinese materia medica (Template:Zh-stp), is also the medicine based on traditional Chinese medicine theory. it includes Chinese crude medicine, prepared drug in pieces of Chinese materia medica and traditional Chinese patent medicines and simple preparations, etc.\nHerbology is the Chinese art of combining medicinal herbs.\nHerbology is traditionally one of the more important modalities utilized in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM).  Each herbal medicine prescription is a cocktail of many herbs tailored to the individual patient. One batch of herbs is typically decocted twice over the course of one hour. The practitioner usually designs a remedy using one or two main ingredients that target the illness. Then the practitioner adds many other ingredients to adjust the formula to the patient's yin/yang conditions. Sometimes, ingredients are needed to cancel out toxicity or side-effects of the main ingredients. Some herbs require the use of other ingredients as catalyst or else the brew is ineffective. The latter steps require great experience and knowledge, and make the difference between a good Chinese herbal doctor and an amateur.  Unlike western medications, the balance and interaction of all the ingredients are considered more important than the effect of individual ingredients. A key to success in TCM is the treatment of each patient as an individual. See also: Individualism\nChinese herbology often incorporates ingredients from all parts of plants, the leaf, stem, flower, root, and also ingredients from animals and minerals. The use of parts of endangered species (such as seahorses, rhinoceros horns, and tiger bones) has created controversy and resulted in a black market of poachers who hunt restricted animals. Many herbal manufacturers have discontinued the use of any parts from endangered animals.\n\n# History of Chinese herbology\nChinese herbs have been used for centuries.  The first herbalist in Chinese tradition is Shennong, a mythical personage, who is said to have tasted hundreds of herbs and imparted his knowledge of medicinal and poisonous plants to the agricultural people.   The first Chinese manual on pharmacology, the Shennong Bencao Jing (Shennong Emperor's Classic of Materia Medica), lists some 365 medicines of which 252 of them are herbs, and dates back somewhere in the 1st century C.E. Han dynasty. Earlier literature included lists of prescriptions for specific ailments, exemplified by a manuscript \"Recipes for 52 Ailments\", found in the MaWangDui tomb, sealed in 168 B.C.E.\nSucceeding generations augmented on this work, as in the Yaoxing Lun (藥性論; also spelled Yao Xing Lun; literally \"Treatise on the Nature of Medicinal Herbs\"), a 7th century Tang Dynasty Chinese treatise on herbal medicine.\nArguably the most important of these was the Compendium of Materia Medica (Bencao Gangmu) compiled during the Ming dynasty by Li Shizhen, which is still used today for consultation and reference.\nThe history of this literature is presented in Paul U. Unschuld's \"Medicine in China: a History of Pharmaceutics\"; Univ. of Calif. Press, 1986.\n\n# Categorizing Chinese herbs\nChinese physicians used several different methods to classify traditional Chinese herbs:\n- The Four Natures (四氣 or 四性)\n- The Five Tastes (五味)\n- The Meridians (歸經)\nThe earlier (Han through Tang eras) Ben Cao (Materia Medicae) began with a three-level categorization:\nLow level -- drastic acting, toxic substances; \nMiddle level -- medicinal physiological effects;\nHigh level -- health and spirit enhancement\nDuring the neo-Confucian Song-Jin-Yuan era (10th to 12th Centuries), the theoretical framework from acupuncture theory (which was rooted in Confucian Han theory) was formally applied to herbal categorization (which was earlier more the domain of Daoist natural science). In particular, alignment with the Five Phases (Tastes) and the 12 channels (Meridians theory) came to be used after this period.\n\n## The Four Natures\nThis pertains to the degree of yin and yang, ranging from cold (extreme yin), cool, neutral to warm and hot (extreme yang).  The patient's internal balance of yin and yang is taken into account when the herbs are selected.  For example, medicinal herbs of \"hot\", yang nature are used when the person is suffering from internal cold that requires to be purged, or when the patient has a general cold constituency.  Sometimes an ingredient is added to offset the extreme effect of one herb.\n\n## The Five Tastes\nThe five tastes are pungent, sweet, sour, bitter and salty, each of which their functions and characteristics.  For example, pungent herbs are used to generate sweat and to direct and vitalize qi and the blood.  Sweet-tasting herbs often tonify or harmonize bodily systems.  Some sweet-tasting herbs also exhibit a bland taste, which helps drain dampness through diuresis.  Sour taste most often is astringent or consolidates, while bitter taste dispels heat, purges the bowels and get rid of dampness by drying them out.  Salty tastes soften hard masses as well as purge and open the bowels.\n\n## The Meridians\nThe Meridians refer to which organs the herb acts upon.  For example, menthol is pungent, cool and is linked with the lungs and the liver.  Since the lungs is the organ which protects the body from invasion from cold and influenza, menthol can help purge coldness in the lungs and invading heat toxins caused by \nhot \"wind\".\n\n# Chinese patent medicine\nChinese patent medicine (traditional Chinese: 中成藥, Simplified Chinese: 中成药,  pinyin: zhōng chéng yào) is a kind of traditional Chinese medicine.  They are standardized herbal formulas.  Several herbs and other ingredients are dried and ground.  They are then mixed into a powder and formed into pills.  The binder is traditionally honey.  They are characteristically little round black pills.\nChinese patent medicines are easy and convenient.  They are not easy to customize on a patient-by-patient basis, however. They are best used when a patient's condition is not severe and the medicine can be taken as a long-term treatment.\nThese medicines are not \"patented\" in the traditional sense of the word.  No one has exclusive rights to the formula.  Instead, \"patent\" refers to the standardization of the formula.

{"guideline_text": "Aneurysm overview\n\n# Overview\nAn aneurysm (or aneurism) is a localized, blood-filled dilation (bulge) of a blood vessel caused by disease or weakening of the vessel wall. Aneurysms most commonly occur in arteries at the base of the brain (the circle of Willis) and in the aorta (the main artery coming out of the heart), a so-called aortic aneurysm. The bulge in a blood vessel can burst and lead to death at any time. The larger an aneurysm becomes, the more likely it is to burst.  Aneurysms can usually be treated.\n\n# Historical Perspective\nSurgical clipping for the treatment of aneurysm was introduced by Walter Dandy of the Johns Hopkins Hospital in 1937.\n\n# Classification\nAneurysms may involve arteries or veins and have various causes. They are commonly further classified by shape, structure and location.\n\n# Pathophysiology\nMost frequent site of occurrence is in the anterior cerebral artery from the circle of Willis. The occurrence and expansion of an aneurysm in a given segment of the arterial tree involves local hemodynamic factors and factors intrinsic to the arterial segment itself.\n\n# Treatment\n\n## Primary Prevention\nControl of high blood pressure may help prevent some aneurysms. Following a healthy diet, getting regular exercise, and keeping your cholesterol at a healthy level may also help prevent aneurysms or their complications. Do not smoke. If you do, quitting will lower your risk of an aneurysm.", "source": "wikidoc", "question": "According to authoritative guidelines, discuss the primary prevention of arterial aneurysms, outlining the modifiable risk factors that should be targeted (including blood pressure, diet, exercise, cholesterol, and smoking), the rationale linking these measures to aneurysm pathophysiology and rupture risk, and how prevention strategies might be prioritized in clinical practice."}

The members of this family encode proteins with 50 to 80% sequence identity to each other. The promoters and first exons of the MAGEA genes show considerable variability, suggesting that the existence of this gene family enables the same function to be expressed under different transcriptional controls. The MAGEA genes are clustered at chromosomal location Xq28. They have been implicated in some hereditary disorders, such as dyskeratosis congenita.\n\n# Function and Clinical relevance\nThe normal function of MAGE-A3 in healthy cells is unknown. The presence of the antigen on tumor cells has been associated with worse prognosis. In one study, high levels of MAGE-A3 in lung adenocarcinoma were associated with shorter survival.\nMAGE-A3 is a tumor-specific protein, and has been identified on many tumors including melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, hematologic malignancies, among others.

{"guideline_text": "Mendelian randomization\nIn epidemiology, Mendelian randomization is \"the use of the genetic variation of known functions or phenotypes to correlate the causal effects of those functions or phenotypes with a disease outcome\". Mendelian randomization controlls for extraneous influences when a true controlled experiment, or a sequence of randomized clinical trials, cannot be carried out. The method takes its name from Gregor Mendel, the father of modern genetics.\n\n# Background\nAn important focus of observational epidemiology is the identification of modifiable causes of common diseases that are of public health interest.  In order to have firm evidence that a recommended public health intervention will have the desired beneficial effect, the observed association between the particular risk factor and disease must imply that the risk factor actually causes the disease.\nWell-known successes include the identified causal links between smoking and lung cancer, and between blood pressure and stroke.  However, there have also been notable failures when identified exposures were later shown by randomised controlled trials (RCTs) to be non-causal. For instance, it has now been shown that hormone replacement therapy will not prevent cardiovascular disease, as was previously thought, and may have other adverse health effects. The reason for such spurious findings in observational epidemiology is most likely to be confounding social, behavioural or physiological factors which are difficult to control for and particularly difficult to measure accurately.  Moreover, many findings cannot be replicated by RCTs for ethical reasons.\n\n# Implementing Mendelian randomization\nMendelian randomization is a method that allows one to test for, or in certain cases to estimate, a causal effect from observational data in the presence of confounding factors. It uses common genetic polymorphisms with well-understood effects on exposure patterns (e.g., propensity to drink alcohol) or effects that mimic those produced by modifiable exposures (e.g., raised blood cholesterol). Importantly, the genotype must only affect the disease status indirectly via its effect on the exposure of interest. Because genotypes are assigned randomly when passed from parents to offspring during meiosis, the population genotype distribution should be unrelated to the confounders that typically plague observational epidemiology studies. In this regard, Mendelian randomization can be thought of as a “natural” RCT. The method relies on getting good estimates from genetic association studies. Misleading conclusions can also be drawn in the presence of linkage disequilibrium, genetic heterogeneity, pleiotropy, or population stratification.", "source": "wikidoc", "question": "According to authoritative guidelines, discuss how Mendelian randomization can be used to infer causal effects from observational epidemiological data, outlining the method's underlying principles, the key assumptions required for valid inference (including how genotypes must relate to exposures and outcomes), common sources of bias (such as linkage disequilibrium, pleiotropy, genetic heterogeneity, and population stratification), and practical steps and safeguards investigators should use when implementing and interpreting Mendelian randomization studies."}
{"guideline_text": "Swallowable gastric balloon capsule for weight loss\n\nEvidence-based recommendations on swallowable gastric balloon capsules for weight loss in adults. This involves swallowing a capsule containing a balloon that is then filled with liquid to inflate it in the stomach. It stays in the stomach for around 4 months to give a feeling of fullness and temporarily restrict the size of the stomach.\n\n# Recommendations\nEvidence on the safety of the swallowable gastric balloon capsule for weight loss shows infrequent but potentially serious adverse events:\nFor people who need to lose weight in the short term for medical reasons, the evidence of efficacy is adequate to support the use of this procedure provided that special arrangements are in place for clinical governance, consent and audit. Find out what special arrangements mean on the NICE interventional procedures guidance page.\nFor people who are aiming for long-term weight loss, the evidence on efficacy is inadequate in quantity and quality, so the procedure should only be used in the context of research. Find out what only in research means on the NICE interventional procedures guidance page.\nClinicians wishing to use a swallowable gastric balloon capsule for weight loss should:\nInform the clinical governance leads in their healthcare organisation.\nGive patients (and their families and carers as appropriate) clear written information to support shared decision making, including NICE's information for the public.\nEnsure that patients (and their families and carers as appropriate) understand the procedure's safety and efficacy, and any uncertainties about these.\nAudit and review clinical outcomes of all patients having the procedure. The main efficacy and safety outcomes identified in this guidance can be entered into NICE's interventional procedure outcomes audit tool (for use at local discretion).\nDiscuss the outcomes of the procedure during their annual appraisal to reflect, learn and improve.\nFurther research could be in the form of randomised controlled trials comparing the procedure with current standard therapies, or an observational cohort study, including using registry data. Studies should include details of patient selection such as body mass index and other treatments such as diet and lifestyle changes. They should also report:\nshort- and long-term weight loss\nquality of life\nmetabolic parameters\nthe need for later surgery.# The condition, current treatments and procedure\n\n# The condition\nOverweight is defined as a body mass index (BMI) of 25 kg/m2 to 29.9 kg/m2 and obesity as a BMI of 30 kg/m2 or more. Overweight and obesity increase people's risk of type 2 diabetes, coronary heart disease and hypertension. Weight loss reduces these risks and improves life expectancy.\n\n# Current treatments\nObesity is managed by dietary advice, physical activity and exercise, lifestyle and behavioural changes, and medication. Bariatric surgery is considered for people:\nwhose BMI is over 40 kg/m2, or over 35 kg/m2 if they have other significant comorbidities, and\nwho have not been able to reach or maintain a clinically beneficial weight using non‑surgical measures.Surgical procedures include gastric banding, sleeve gastrectomy, or Roux‑en‑Y gastric bypass or other diversion procedures.\nPeople unable to lose weight by non-surgical measures who do not want invasive surgery can have less invasive bariatric procedures. Examples are endoscopic intragastric balloons, gastrointestinal bypass sleeves, endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty and endoluminal restrictive surgical techniques.\n\n# The procedure\nA swallowable gastric balloon capsule for weight loss must be used with a nutrition and behaviour modification programme supervised by a suitably qualified and registered healthcare professional.\nThe procedure is usually done in an outpatient setting without endoscopy or sedation. The patient swallows a capsule containing the deflated balloon, which is attached to a fine delivery catheter, with water. If they have difficulty swallowing the capsule, a stylet can be fed through the catheter to stiffen it. This allows the doctor to help push the catheter during swallowing. After the capsule reaches the stomach this stylet is removed. The position in the stomach is confirmed by X‑ray using guide marks on the catheter. The capsule disintegrates and the balloon is inflated with a fixed amount of fluid (for example, distilled water and citric acid) through the connected catheter. After the balloon is inflated, the catheter is detached by pulling it firmly from the patient's mouth. Imaging is done to recheck position and inflation. After a short wait to make sure the patient can tolerate the balloon, they are discharged with medication including anti-emetics, antispasmodics and proton pump inhibitors. About 4 months later, a resorbable material element of the balloon degrades, which then allows a release valve to open and expel the fluid into the stomach gradually. The deflated balloon then passes through the gastrointestinal tract to be excreted through the bowel.", "source": "nice", "question": "According to authoritative NICE interventional procedures guidance, discuss how you would select and manage an adult patient being considered for a swallowable gastric balloon capsule for weight loss, including which patients are appropriate for treatment versus research only, the safety and efficacy information you would disclose during shared decision‑making, the organisational governance and audit arrangements you would put in place, and the key outcomes you would record and review."}

{"guideline_text": "Ceftazidime Injection (patient information)\n\n# About your treatment\nYour doctor has ordered ceftazidime, an antibiotic, to help treat your infection. The drug will be either injected into a large muscle (such as your buttock or hip) or added to an intravenous fluid that will drip through a needle or catheter placed in your vein for 30 minutes, one to three times a day.\nCeftazidime eliminates bacteria that cause many kinds of infections, including lung, skin, bone, joint, stomach, blood, gynecological, and urinary tract infections. This medication is sometimes prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.\nYour health care provider (doctor, nurse, or pharmacist) may measure the effectiveness and side effects of your treatment using laboratory tests and physical examinations. It is important to keep all appointments with your doctor and the laboratory. The length of treatment depends on how your infection and symptoms respond to the medication.\n\n# Precautions\nBefore administering ceftazidime:\n- tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to ceftazidime, any other cephalosporin , penicillins, or any other drugs.\n- tell your doctor and pharmacist what prescription and nonprescription medications you are taking, especially other antibiotics, probenecid (Benemid), and vitamins.\n- tell your doctor if you have or have ever had kidney, liver, or gastrointestinal disease (especially colitis).\n- tell your doctor if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breast-feeding. If you become pregnant while taking ceftazidime, call your doctor.\n- if you have diabetes and regularly check your urine for sugar, use Clinistix or TesTape. Do not use Clinitest tablets because ceftazidime may cause false positive results.\n\n# Administering your medication\nBefore you administer ceftazidime:\nlook at the solution closely. It should be clear and free of floating material. Gently squeeze the bag or observe the solution container to make sure there are no leaks. Do not use the solution if it is discolored, if it contains particles, or if the bag or container leaks.

{"guideline_text": "Glycemic index\nGlycemic index (also glycaemic index, GI) is a ranking system for carbohydrates based on their effect on blood glucose levels. It compares available carbohydrates gram for gram in individual foods, providing a numerical, evidence-based index of postprandial (post-meal) glycemia. The concept was invented by Dr. David J. Jenkins and colleagues in 1981 at the University of Toronto.\nCarbohydrates that break down rapidly during digestion have the highest glycemic indices.\nCarbohydrates that break down slowly, releasing glucose gradually into the blood stream, have a low glycemic index. A lower glycemic index suggests slower rates of digestion and absorption of the sugars and starches in the foods and may also indicate greater extraction from the liver and periphery of the products of carbohydrate digestion. A lower glycemic response is often thought to equate to a lower insulin demand, better long-term blood glucose control and a reduction in blood lipids. The insulin index may therefore also be useful as it provides a direct measure of the insulin response to a food.\nThe glycemic index of a food is defined by the area under the two hour blood glucose response curve (AUC) following the ingestion of a fixed portion of carbohydrate (usually 50 g). The AUC of the test food is divided by the AUC of the standard (either glucose or white bread, giving two different definitions) and multiplied by 100.\nThe average GI value is calculated from data collected in 10 human subjects. Both the standard and test food must contain an equal amount of available carbohydrate. The result gives a relative ranking for each tested food.\nThe current validated methods use glucose as the reference food, giving it a glycemic index value of 100 by definition. This has the advantages in that it is universal and it results in maximum GI values of approximately 100. White bread can also be used as a reference food, giving a different set of GI values (if white bread = 100, then glucose ≈ 140). For people whose staple carbohydrate source is white bread, this has the advantage of conveying directly whether replacement of the dietary staple with a different food would result in faster or slower blood glucose response. The disadvantages with this system are that the reference food is not well-defined, and the GI scale is culture dependent.\n\n# Glycemic index of foods\nGI values can be interpreted intuitively as percentages on an absolute scale and are commonly interpreted as follows:\nA low GI food will release glucose more slowly and steadily.\nA high GI food causes a more rapid rise in blood glucose levels and is suitable for energy recovery after endurance exercise or for a person with diabetes experiencing hypoglycemia.\nThe glycemic effect of foods depends on a number of factors such as the type of starch (amylose vs. amylopectin), physical entrapment of the starch molecules within the food, fat and protein content of the food and organic acids or their salts in the meal — adding vinegar for example, will lower the GI. The presence of fat or soluble dietary fibre can slow the gastric emptying rate thus lowering the GI. Unrefined breads with higher amounts of fiber generally have a lower GI value than white breads. Many brown breads, however, are treated with enzymes to soften the crust, which makes the starch more accessible. This raises the GI, with some brown breads even having GI values over 100.\nWhile adding butter or oil will lower the GI of meal, the GI ranking does not change. That is, with or without additions, there is still a higher blood glucose curve after white bread than after a low GI bread such as pumpernickel.\nThe glycemic index can only be applied to foods with a reasonable carbohydrate content, as the test relies on subjects consuming enough of the test food to yield about 50 g of available carbohydrate.\nMany fruits and vegetables (but not potatoes) contain very little carbohydrate per serving, or have very low GI values. This also applies to carrots, which were originally and incorrectly reported as having a high GI. Alcoholic beverages have been reported to have low GI values, however it should be noted that beer has a moderate GI. Recent studies have shown that the consumption of an alcoholic drink prior to a meal reduces the GI of the meal by approximately 15%.\nMany modern diets rely on the Glycemic Index, including the South Beach Diet and NutriSystem Nourish Diet .\n\n# Disease prevention\nSeveral lines of recent scientific evidence have shown that individuals who followed a low GI diet over many years were at a significantly lower risk for developing both type 2 diabetes and coronary heart disease than others, but the results obviously depend on the two diets being compared. High blood glucose levels or repeated glycemic \"spikes\" following a meal may promote these diseases by increasing oxidative damage to the vasculature and also by the direct increase in insulin levels.\nIn the past, post-meal hyperglycemia has been a risk factor mainly associated with diabetes, however more recent evidence shows that postprandial hyperglycemia presents an increased risk for atherosclerosis in the non-diabetic population.\nOn the other hand there are regions, such as Peru and Asia, where people eat high-glycemic index foods such as potatoes and rice, but without a high level of obesity or diabetes. The high consumption of legumes in South America and fresh fruit and vegetables in Asia likely has a lowering glycemic effect in these individuals. The mixing of high and low GI carbohydrates produces moderate GI values.\nThe glycemic index is supported by leading international health organisations including the American Diabetes Association.\n\n# Weight control\nRecent animal research provides compelling evidence that high GI carbohydrate is associated with increased risk of obesity. In human trials, it is typically difficult to separate the effects from GI and other potentially confounding factors such as fibre content, palatability, and compliance. In the study (Pawlak et al, 2004), male rats were split into high and low GI groups over 18 weeks while mean bodyweight was maintained. Rats fed the high GI diet were 71% fatter and had 8% less lean body mass than the low GI group. Postmeal glycemia and insulin levels were significantly higher and plasma triglycerides were threefold greater in the high GI fed rats. Furthermore, pancreatic islet cells suffered \"severely disorganised architecture and extensive fibrosis\". The evidence in this study showed that continued consumption of high glycemic index carbohydrates would likely have led to the development of severe metabolic abnormalities.\n\n# Endurance athletes\nEndurance athletes such as ultra-marathoners and Ironman triathletes have become increasingly aware of the glycemic index of foods taken before and during training and competition. In the hours before a competition athletes may consume foods with a lower GI value so that energy is released more slowly. During competition, the athlete may try to balance the consumption of high and low glycemic index foods to maintain constant energy levels and avoid \"energy spikes\".\n\n# Criticism\nThe glycemic index has been criticised for the following reasons:\n- The GI does not take into consideration other factors besides glycemic response, such as insulin response.\n- The GI of a food varies depending on the kind of food, its ripeness, the length of time it was stored, how it was cooked, and its variety (potatoes).\n- The GI of a food varies from person to person and even in a single individual from day to day, depending on blood glucose levels, insulin resistance, and other factors.\n- The GI of a mixed meal can be difficult to predict.  For example, fats and proteins can make a meal sit in the stomach longer, which reduces a food's GI.\n- The GI value is based on a portion that contains 50 grams of carbohydrate only.  This criticism can be addressed by taking the Glycemic load into account.", "source": "wikidoc", "question": "According to authoritative guidelines on the glycemic index (as described in the provided recommendation), discuss how clinicians should use GI when advising patients on dietary choices for prevention of type 2 diabetes and coronary heart disease, including: how GI is measured and interpreted; the physiological rationale linking GI to disease risk; major factors that alter a food's GI and the limitations of GI (including inter- and intra-individual variability and mixed meals); the role of glycemic load; and practical, evidence-based counseling points and caveats to communicate to patients."}

{"guideline_text": "Travoprost Ophthalmic (patient information)\n\n# Why is this medication prescribed\nTravoprost is used to treat eye conditions, including glaucoma and ocular hypertension, in which increased pressure can lead to a gradual loss of vision. Travoprost is used for patients who cannot use other eye medications for their condition or whose eye condition has not responded to another medication. Travoprost is in a class of medications called prostanoid agonists. It lowers pressure in the eye by increasing the flow of natural eye fluids out of the eye.\n\n# How should this medicine be used\nTravoprost comes as an eyedrop to apply to the eye. It is usually applied to the affected eye(s) once a day in the evening. To help you remember to use travoprost, use it around the same time every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use travoprost exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\nTravoprost controls glaucoma and ocular hypertension but does not cure them. Continue to use travoprost even if you feel well. Do not stop using travoprost without talking to your doctor.\nTo apply the eyedrops, follow these steps:\n- Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water.\n- Use a mirror or have someone else put the drops in your eye.\n- Make sure the end of the dropper is not chipped or cracked.\n- Avoid touching the dropper against your eye or anything else.\n- Hold the dropper tip down at all times to prevent drops from flowing back into the bottle and contaminating the remaining contents.\n- Lie down or tilt your head back.\n- Holding the bottle between your thumb and index finger, place the dropper as near as possible to your eyelid without touching it.\n- Brace the remaining fingers of that hand against your cheek or nose.\n- With the index finger of your other hand, pull the lower lid of the eye down to form a pocket.\n- Drop the prescribed number of drops into the pocket made by the lower lid and the eye. Placing the drops on the surface of the eyeball can cause stinging.\n- Close your eye and press lightly against the lower lid with your finger for 2-3 minutes to keep the medication in the eye. Do not blink.\n- Replace and tighten the cap right away. Do not wipe or rinse it off.\n- Wipe off any excess liquid from your cheek with a clean tissue. Wash your hands again.\n\n# Other uses for this medicine\nThis medication may be prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.\n\n# What special precautions should I follow\nBefore using travoprost\n- tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to travoprost, benzalkonium chloride, or any other medications.\n- tell your doctor and pharmacist what prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking.\n- if you are using another topical eye medication, apply it at least 5 minutes before or after travoprost.\n- tell your doctor if you have inflammation (swelling) of the eye or a torn or missing lens and if you have or have ever had liver or kidney disease.\n- tell your doctor if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breast-feeding. If you become pregnant while using travoprost, call your doctor immediately.\n- you should know that pregnant women should avoid touching travoprost solution. If a pregnant woman comes into contact with the contents of the travoprost bottle, she should immediately wash the exposed area with soap and water.\n- you should know that travoprost solution contains benzalkonium chloride, which can be absorbed by soft contact lenses. If you wear contact lenses, remove them before applying travoprost and put them back in 15 minutes later.\n- if you have an eye injury, infection, or surgery while using travoprost, ask your doctor if you should continue using the same eyedrops container.\n\n# What special dietary instructions should I follow\nUnless your doctor tells you otherwise, continue your normal diet.\n\n# What should I do if I forget a dose\nApply the missed dose as soon as you remember it. However, if it is almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and continue your regular dosing schedule. Do not apply a double dose to make up for a missed one.\n\n# Side Effects\n\n## Minor Side Effects\nTravoprost may cause side effects. Tell your doctor if any of these symptoms are severe or do not go away:\n- eye pain or irritation\n- blurred vision\n- dry eyes\n- eye tearing\n- headache\n\n## Severe Side Effects\nSome side effects can be serious. The following symptoms are uncommon, but if you experience any of them, call your doctor immediately:\n- sensitivity to light\n- abnormal vision\n- pink eye\n- redness or swelling of the eyelid\nTravoprost may change the color of your eye (to brown) and darken the skin around the eye. It may also cause your eyelashes to grow longer and thicker and darken in color. These changes usually occur slowly, but they may be permanent. If you use travoprost in only one eye, you should know that there may be a difference between your eyes after taking travoprost. Call your doctor if you notice these changes.\nTravoprost may cause other side effects. Call your doctor if you have any unusual problems while taking this medication.\nIf you experience a serious side effect, you or your doctor may send a report to the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) MedWatch Adverse Event Reporting program online  or by phone .\n\n# What storage conditions are needed for this medicine\nKeep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). Throw away any medication that is outdated or no longer needed. Talk to your pharmacist about the proper disposal of your medication.\n\n# What other information should I know\nKeep all appointments with your doctor.\nDo not let anyone else use your medication.

The drug is legally distributed in Mexico under the trade name Asenlix by the Aventis pharmaceutical corporation.\nChemically, clobenzorex is an N-substituted amphetamine analog that is converted to (d) amphetamine soon after ingestion.  In commercial production, clobenzorex is supplied in 30mg doses as the hydrochloride salt in green-tinted capsules.  The drug gained use as a prescription anorectic in the 1970s; however, adverse reactions were eventually observed, which led to the prohibition of clobenzorex in the US and certain other countries.\nIn the United States of America, clobenzorex tablets (among other varieties of stimulants, such as amphetamine) have been used by athletes who ingest the drug to reduce fatigue, increase attention, and improve reaction times during athletic activities.

{"guideline_text": "FASTKD2\nFAST kinase domain-containing protein 2 (FASTKD2) is a protein that in humans is encoded by the FASTKD2 gene on chromosome 2. This protein is part of the FASTKD family, which is known for regulating the energy balance of mitochondria under stress. FASTKD2 has been implicated in mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, breast cancer, and prostate cancer.\n\n# Structure\nFASTKD2 shares structural characteristics of the FASTKD family, including a ~50-amino acid N-terminal mitochondrial targeting domain and three C-terminal domains: two FAST kinase-like domains (FAST_1 and FAST_2) and a RNA-binding domain (RAP). The mitochondrial  targeting domain directs FASTKD2 to be imported into the mitochondria. Though the functions of the C-terminal domains are unknown, RAP possibly binds RNA during trans-splicing.\n\n# Function\nAs a member of the FASTKD family, FASTKD2 localizes to the inner mitochondrial membrane to modulate their energy balance, especially under conditions of stress. Though ubiquitously expressed in all tissues, FASTKD2 appears more abundantly in skeletal muscle, heart muscle, and other tissues enriched in mitochondria. Nonetheless, FASTKD2 has been observed to mediate apoptosis independent of import into the mitochondria, suggesting that it interacts with proteins on the outer mitochondrial membrane. This protein possibly contributes its proapoptotic function through a caspase-dependent pathway, by activating proapoptotic factors or inhibiting antiapoptotic factors, but the exact mechanism remain unclear. FASTKD2 has also been validated as an RNA-binding protein.\n\n# Clinical significance\nFASTKD2 is an important apoptotic constituent. During a normal embryologic processes, or during cell injury (such as ischemia-reperfusion injury during heart attacks and strokes) or during developments and processes in cancer, an apoptotic cell undergoes structural changes including cell shrinkage, plasma membrane blebbing, nuclear condensation, and fragmentation of the DNA and nucleus. This is followed by fragmentation into apoptotic bodies that are quickly removed by phagocytes, thereby preventing an inflammatory response. It is a mode of cell death defined by characteristic morphological, biochemical and molecular changes. It was first described as a \"shrinkage necrosis\", and then this term was replaced by apoptosis to emphasize its role opposite mitosis in tissue kinetics. In later stages of apoptosis the entire cell becomes fragmented, forming a number of plasma membrane-bounded apoptotic bodies which contain nuclear and or cytoplasmic elements. The ultrastructural appearance of necrosis is quite different, the main features being mitochondrial swelling, plasma membrane breakdown and cellular disintegration. Apoptosis occurs in many physiological and pathological processes. It plays an important role during embryonal development as programmed cell death and accompanies a variety of normal involutional processes in which it serves as a mechanism to remove \"unwanted\" cells.\nFASTKD2 has been linked to mitochondrial encephalomyopathy associated with cytochrome c oxidase deficiency (mitochondrial complex IV deficiency). Nonsense mutations in FASTKD2 produce a truncated protein that cuts off the RAP domain and part of the FAST domains, leading to  dampened sensitivity to apoptotic stimuli. Moreover, breast cancer cells are protected against apoptosis by stimulating NRIF3/DD1 expression or DIF-1 knockdown, which thus suppresses the proapoptotic function of FASTKD2. The proapoptotic function is similarly observed in prostate cancer cells, but not in other cells; it is suggested that susceptibility to FASTKD2-mediated apoptosis requires certain factors to associate with the DIF-1 complex to bind. Thus far, activating and enhancing expression of FASTKD2 may prove effective in killing breast and prostate cancer cells.\n\n# Interactions\nFASTKD2 has been shown to interact with FASTKD3. The FASTKD2 gene has been observed to bind the DIF-1 complex.", "source": "wikidoc", "question": "\"According to authoritative guidelines, discuss how the structural features and known functions of FASTKD2 account for its role in mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis, and explain the clinical implications of FASTKD2 dysfunction—specifically how nonsense mutations lead to mitochondrial encephalomyopathy with cytochrome c oxidase deficiency and how modulation of FASTKD2 activity might be exploited therapeutically in breast and prostate cancer.\""}
{"guideline_text": "Royal Australian College of General Practitioners\nThe Royal Australian College Of General Practitioners is the professional body for General Practitioners in Australia.\nThe Royal Australian College of General Practitioners is responsible for maintaining standards for quality clinical practice, education and training, and research in Australian general practice. The RACGP has the largest general practitioner membership of any medical organisation in Australia, with the majority of Australia's general practitioners belonging to their professional college. Over 22,000 general practitioners are members of the RACGP Continuing Professional Development Program. The RACGP National Rural Faculty, representing more than 5000 members, has the largest rural general practitioner membership of any medical organisation in Australia.\n\n# History of General Practice in Australia and beyond\nPrior to the mid 20th century, upon graduation Australian doctors spent time in general practice. The common passage of a medical career comprised of most doctors completing an intern year immediately post graduation as a resident in a major teaching hospital. After a period of time in general practice, some doctors would seek specialist qualifications. Possibly reflecting the historical origins of Australia as a series of British colonies, these doctors would travel overseas, most often to the UK, to specialise and then return to establish practice.\nAs the Australian population grew post World War II, the public hospital system also grew demanding an increasing number of specialists. Local training program emerged and therefore the ability of a doctor to enter specialist training directly following the mandatory intern year post graduation without entering general practice. This increasing number of specialist made it increasingly difficult to general practitioners in Australia to hold and retain public hospital appointments, especially in procedural areas such as surgery or obstetrics.\nThis was not a uniquely Australian phenomenon. Worldwide, medical practice was shifting focus onto hospitals with the expansion of pharmaceuticals and medical and surgical interventions. In the United States, the number of doctors identifying as General Practitioners fell markedly between 1931 and 1974 from 83% to 18%. This process began as specialisation increased prior to the War. US GPs increasingly felt that health care was becoming fragmented and weakening doctor patient relationships.\n“There are 57 different varieties of specialist to diagnose and treat 57 different varieties of disease but no physician to take care of the patient.\"\n\n## Development of Professional Colleges\nThis led to the creation of the American Academy of General Practice (later Family Physicians) in 1947.\nSimilarly, in the UK, the increasing specialisation and cost of healthcare, saw the introduction of the National Health Service (NHS), designed to have GPs act as the ‘gatekeepers’ providing primary care to all patients registered on their ‘list’ and referring as appropriate to gain access to specialist care and other benefits under the UK’s socialised heath system. The UK experience is notably through the contribution and involvement of many influential and effective Australians in defining the problems of general practice and the need for a professional and academic basis to the craft group.\nIn 1950, an Australian Graduate, Dr Joseph Collings, conducted a review of general practice in the UK. This 30 page report was published in the Lancet in 1950.\n“There are no real standards for general practice. What a doctor does and how he does it depends entirely on his own conscience” Dr Collings, 1950.\nDr Collings’ report was scathing and generated immediate and heated interest. It was undoubtably a key event in the definition of general practice as a speciality.\nHe identified that general practice has no academic underpinning, no evidence upon which to base practice and no consistency of practice. The report did not pull punches. He described rural practice is “an anachronism”, suburban practice is a “casualty-clearing” service and Inner city practice is “at best… very unsatisfactory and at worst a positive source of public danger.” \nThere is a direct link between the public criticism of general practice and the move to create a College. Dr Rose and Dr Hunt in the BMJ 1950 write:\n“There is a College of Physicians, a College of Surgeons, a College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, a College of Nursing, a College of Midwives and a college of Veterinary Surgeons, all of them Royal Colleges; there is a College of Speech Therapists and a College of Physical Education, but there is no college or academic body to represent primarily the interests of the largest group of medical personnel in this country – the 20,000 general practitioners.” \nInterestingly, there was opposition in the UK to the creation of a College by the existing three Medical Colleges – Colleges of Surgeons, Physicians and Obstetricians and Gynaecologists – who held the belief that general practice should be a joint faculty of general practice linked to the existing Colleges. However, put into perspective, in the same document Hunt describes the two original British Colleges sought to stop the creation of the College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists via legal action in 1929.\n\n## The Development of the Australian College of General Practitioners\nThe British College of General Practitioners was formed in 1953 with many Australian doctors amongst the founding members including the RACGP’s first president Dr William Connelly. Dr Connelly, again reflecting the origins of Australia as a series of British colonies, established a New South Wales faculty of the BCGP. This was followed by the creation of other state based faculties of the British College of General Practitioners in Queensland, Western Australia, Tasmania, Victoria and South Australia over the next 5 years.\nIn keeping with the process for creating Medical Colleges under the British system, a group of Australian General Practitioners met in 1957 at the first Annual Scientific Convention in Sydney to declare an intention to form the Australian College of General Practitioners (ACGP) which was formally founded in 1958. This new College joined the state based faculties. State based faculties remain a key part of the modern day function of the RACGP.\n\n### The Objectives of the Australian College of General Practitioners\nThis College established the following objectives:\n- To promote a scientific approach to problems of disease at the level of the individual and the family;\n- To promote the prevention of disease and guard the nation’s health and the welfare of the community by every means available to the general practitioner;\n- To foster and maintain high standards of general practice;\n- To encourage and assist young men and women in preparing for, qualifying in and establishing themselves in general practice;\n- To stimulate postgraduate education of general practitioners by providing facilities applicable to general practice; and\n- To conduct clinical research into conditions most frequently seen and appropriately studied in general practice.\n\n## Recognition of General Practice as a medical specialty\nIn modern Australia, General Practice is listed by the AMC as a medical specialty and the RACGP as the specialist college responsible for assessment. Yet, on further examination of how general practice is considered across the nation, some State-based Medical Practitioners’ Boards such as Victoria, Queensland and South Australia, do not consider general practice a medical specialty and general practice qualifications, such as the Fellowship of the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners (FRACGP) are not registrable qualifications.\nThe oddity of general practice in Australia is a lingering and arguably outdated perception that the decision to practise as a GP has low or no standing and status. Comments heard by many GPs including; ‘You are just a GP’ or ‘What do you intend on specialising in?’ reflect something of the community understanding of the General Practitioner.\nThis is not without precedent. The history of the General Practitioner shows that GPs in early Australia through to GPs in mid and late 20th century, ‘defaulted’ into general practice having disliked surgical or physician training or having failed exit exams too often.\nAlso, while Australian General Practitioners were part of the creation of the Royal College of General Practitioners and instrumental in highlighting the need for professional and practice standards, Australia was one of the last developed countries to recognise general practice as a specialty. It was 1978 before the National Specialist Qualification Advisory Committee (the predecessor to the Australian Medical Council) recognised general practice as a specialty. In contrast, The United Kingdom had a powerful case for recognition by the late 1960s, and the United States recognised general practice in 1969.\n\n### Strengthening general practice\nThe standing of general practice within academic faculties of universities and professionally has undergone a marked increase in recent decades. The RACGP has been a key driver of this shift. The development and consolidation of training programs, standards for training, standards for practice, curriculum of general practice and various evidence based guidelines and publications have occurred internally within the College. Outside of the College there are a few important events:\nDemonstrating again the slow shift towards recognition, Australia was late in accepting that general practice should be taught or regarded as a discipline in its own right. The Whitlam government’s Karmel committee into ‘Expansion of Medical Education in Australia’ compromised with departments of ‘community medicine’ – a confusing anachronism that persisted for many years in Australia’s tertiary institutions. The RACGP sought strongly but unsuccessfully that this committee accept general practice into the universities.\nToday, general practice is listed or has been added along side community medicine, highlighting the shift since the early 1970s (eg Department of General Practice and Community Medicine Monash University)\nNine foundation professors of ‘Community Practice’ were appointed between 1974 and 1976. Again Australia lagged behind the US and the UK who appointed their first professors and Chairs of general practice and family medicine in 1967 and 1963 respectively.\nThe Foundation professors were:\n- Charles Bridges Webb MD FRACGP, Sydney University. Professor of Community Medicine\n- Max Kamien MD FRACP, MRCP, FRACGP, DPM, DCH University of Western Australia. Professor of General Practice\n- Professor Neil Edwin Carson FRACGP FRACP Professor of Community Medicine Monash University\n- Jean Norella Lickliss MD MRACP, FRCP BMedSc DTM&H Professor of Community Medicine University of Tasmania\n- Timothy George Murrell MD FRACGP DTM&H CLJ Professor of Community Medicine\n- Anthony James Radford FRCP MRCP FRACP MFCM SM DTM&H Professor of Primary Health care Flinders University\n- James Geoffrey Ryan BSc FRACGP Professor of community practice University of Queensland\n- Ian William Webster MD FRACP Professor of Community Medicine University of New South Wales\n- Ross Wharton Webster FRACGP MRACP Professor of Community Health University of Melbourne\nNotably, many did not hold general practice qualifications either from Australia or international.\nThe definitive point in Australian General Practice came with John Murtagh's General Practice. \nJohn Murtagh was a science teacher in rural Victoria who return to study Medicine at the first intake of Monash University. John Murtagh has along academic association through Monash University becoming the first Professor of General Practice (Neil Carson was Professor of Community Medicine). He remains with teaching positions at Monash University as Professor in General Practice, University of Notre Dame as Adjunct Clinical Professor and Melbourne University as Professorial Fellow.\nHe was associate medical editor of the Australian Family Physician (the RACGP peer reviewed journal) in 1980, editor in 1986 and held that position until 1995.

{"guideline_text": "Caspase 8\nCaspase-8 is a caspase protein, encoded by the CASP8 gene. It most likely acts upon caspase-3.\nCASP8 orthologs have been identified in numerous mammals for which complete genome data are available. These unique orthologs are also present in birds.\n\n# Function\nThe CASP8 gene encodes a member of the cysteine-aspartic acid protease (caspase) family. Sequential activation of caspases plays a central role in the execution-phase of cell apoptosis. Caspases exist as inactive proenzymes composed of a prodomain, a large protease subunit, and a small protease subunit. Activation of caspases requires proteolytic processing at conserved internal aspartic residues to generate a heterodimeric enzyme consisting of the large and small subunits. This protein is involved in the programmed cell death induced by Fas and various apoptotic stimuli. The N-terminal FADD-like death effector domain of this protein suggests that it may interact with Fas-interacting protein FADD. This protein was detected in the insoluble fraction of the affected brain region from Huntington disease patients but not in those from normal controls, which implicated the role in neurodegenerative diseases. Many alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been described, although not all variants have had their full-length sequences determined.\n\n# Clinical significance\nA very rare genetic disorder of the immune system can also be caused by mutations in this gene.  This disease, called CEDS, stands for “Caspase eight deficiency state.”  CEDS has features similar to ALPS, another genetic disease of apoptosis, with the addition of an immunodeficient phenotype.  Thus, the clinical manifestations include splenomegaly and lymphadenopathy, in addition to recurrent sinopulmonary infections, recurrent mucocutaneous herpesvirus, persistent warts and molluscum contagiosum infections, and hypogammaglobulinemia. There is sometimes lymphocytic infiltrative disease in parenchymal organs, but autoimmunity is minimal and lymphoma has not been observed in the CEDS patients.  CEDS is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner.\nThe clinical phenotype of CEDS patients represented a paradox since caspase-8 was considered to be chiefly a proapoptotic protease, that was mainly involved in signal transduction from Tumor necrosis factor receptor family death receptors such as Fas. The defect in lymphocyte activation and protective immunity suggested that caspase-8 had additional signaling roles in lymphocytes. Further work revealed that caspase-8 was essential for the induction of the transcription factor “nuclear factor κB” (NF-κB) after stimulation through antigen receptors, Fc receptors, or Toll-like receptor 4 in T, B, and natural killer cells.\nBiochemically, caspase-8 was found to enter the complex of the inhibitor of NF-κB kinase (IKK) with the upstream Bcl10-MALT1 (mucosa-associated lymphatic tissue) adapter complex which were crucial for the induction of nuclear translocation of NF-κB.  Moreover, the biochemical form of caspase-8 differed in the two pathways.  For the death pathway, the caspase-8 zymogen is cleaved into subunits that assemble to form the mature, highly active caspase heterotetramer whereas for the activation pathway, the zymogen appears to remain intact perhaps to limit its proteolytic function but enhance its capability as an adapter protein.\n\n# Interactions\nCaspase-8 has been shown to interact with:\n- BCAP31,\n- BID,\n- Bcl-2,\n- CFLAR,\n- Caspase-10,\n- Caspase-2,\n- Caspase-3,\n- Caspase-6,\n- Caspase-7,\n- Caspase-9,\n- DEDD,\n- FADD,\n- FasL,\n- FasR,\n- IFT57,\n- NOL3,\n- PEA15,\n- RIPK1,\n- TNFRSF10B,  and\n- TRAF1.\n\n# Additional photos", "source": "wikidoc", "question": "\"According to authoritative guidelines, discuss the clinical phenotype and mode of inheritance of caspase-8 deficiency state (CEDS), and explain—using the described molecular functions and interactions of CASP8—how mutations in CASP8 produce the combined features of defective apoptosis signaling and impaired lymphocyte activation that underlie the clinical syndrome.\""}
{"guideline_text": "Medical history\n\n# Overview\nThe medical history or anamnesis of a patient is information gained by a physician or other healthcare professional by asking specific questions, either of the patient or of other people who know the person and can give suitable information (in this case, it is sometimes called heteroanamnesis), with the aim of obtaining information useful in formulating a diagnosis and providing medical care to the patient. This kind of information is called the symptoms, in contrast with clinical signs, which are ascertained by direct examination. Most health encounters will result in some form of history being taken. Medical histories vary in their depth and focus. For example an ambulance paramedic would typically limit their history to important details such as name, history of presenting complaint, allergies etc. In contrast, a psychiatric history is frequently lengthy and in depth as many details about the patients life are relevant to formulating a management plan for a psychiatric illness. The information obtained in this way, together with clinical examination, enables the physician to form a diagnosis and treatment plan.  If a diagnosis cannot be made then a provisional diagnosis may be formulated, and other possibilities (the differential diagnosis) may be added, by convention listed in order of likelihood.  The treatment plan may then include further investigations to try and clarify the diagnosis.\n\n# Essential Parts of Medical history taking      \nHistory-taking may be comprehensive history taking (a fixed and extensive set of questions are asked, as practised only by medical students) or iterative hypothesis testing (questions are limited and adapted to rule in or out likely diagnoses based on information already obtained, as practised by busy clinicians). Computerised history-taking could be an integral part of clinical decision support systems. A physician typically asks questions to obtain the following information about the patient:\n\n## Identification and demographics\n- The name, age, height, weight.\n\n## Presenting complaint (PC)\n- This is the most important part to determine the reason patient seeks care. Important to consider using the patient’s terminology. This almost always provides you a “title” for the encounter.\n\n## History of presenting complaint (HOPC)\n- This provide a thorough description of the chief complaint and current problem. The suggested format is as follow: P-Q-R-S-T.\n- P: precipitating and palliative factors: It is essential to identify factors that make symptom worse and/or better; any previous self-treatment or prescribed treatment, and patient's response.\n- Q: quality and quantity descriptors: Allow her/him to identify own rating of symptom (e.g., pain on a 1–10 scale) and descriptors (e.g., numbness, burning sensation, stabbing).\n- R: region and radiation: Ask enough questions to identify the exact location of the symptom and any area of radiation\n- S: severity and associated symptoms: Try to identify the symptom’s severity (e.g., how bad at its worst) and any associated symptoms (e.g., presence or absence of nausea and vomiting, caused dyspnea, associated with chest pain).\n- T: timing and temporal descriptions: This helps to identify when complaint was first noticed; how it has changed/progressed since onset (e.g., remained the same or worsened/improved); whether onset was acute or chronic; whether it has been constant, intermittent, or recurrent.\n- Another mnemonic used sometimes is 'SOCRATES' with questions Site, Onset, Character, Radiation, Association, Timing of complaint, Exacerbating,  and Alleviating factor and Severity.\n\n## Direct question about the differential\n- Direct question regarding differential diagnosis and the associated risk factors with these diagnosis.\n\n## Past medical history (PMH)\n- Similar presenting complaints in past\n- Past history of any other illnesses\n- Hospitalization \n- Past history of any surgeries\n- Stroke, Epilepsy, anesthesia problems\n- Heart disease, blood pressure\n- TB, Bronchitis, asthma\n- Peptic ulcer, Jaundice\n- Diabetes\n- Malignancy\n- Rheumatic fever\n\n## Drug history\n- Over the counter (OTC) drugs\n- Prescription drugs\n- Tablets/Injections\n- Allergies\n- Herbal remedies\n\n## Smoking, alcohol, recreational drug history\n- General question - Duration, quantity, when stopped (if stopped)\n- Smoking - Ask in terms of pack year. 1 pack year = 20 cigarettes / day / year\n- Alcohol - CAGE questionnaire\n\n### CAGE questionnaire\nThe CAGE questionnaire, named for its four questions, is a method to screen for Alcoholism.\nTwo \"yes\" responses indicate that the respondent should be investigated further.\nThe questionnaire asks the following questions:\n- Have you ever felt you needed to Cut down on your drinking?\n- Have people Annoyed you by criticizing your drinking?\n- Have you ever felt Guilty about drinking?\n- Have you ever felt you needed a drink first thing in the morning (Eye-opener) to steady your nerves or to get rid of a hangover?\n\n## Family history\n- A carefully taken family history helps to identify potential sources of hereditary diseases. A genogram (if possible) is helpful; the minimum includes first degree relatives (parents, siblings, children), although 2–3 orders for each topics are helpful.  skin lesions,\n- Similar presenting complaints in family\n- Stroke, Epilepsy, anesthesia problems\n- Heart disease in family can be elicited by the following questions: disease in patient's grandfather and male sibling, smoking, hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, and claudication before 60 years of age.\n- TB, Bronchitis, asthma\n- Diabetes\n- Malignancy\n- Allergies, food intolerance\n- History of oral and genital ulcerations\n\n## Social history\nBe polite and careful while taking a sociocultural history. These questions will help to identify occupational and recreational activities and experiences, living environment, financial status/support as related to patient's health care, needs, travel, lifestyle, etc.\n- Occupation\n- Marital status\n- Spouse job and health\n- Living arrangements,? Do family friends visit often? Are there any dependent in the family (useful in geriatrics, neuropsychiatric patients)\n- Stair cases in home, walking aids (useful in geriatrics patients)\n- Habits: Sleep and exercise patterns (e.g., tea and coffee consumption in the evening may aggravate frequency of urination at night (Differential diagnosis of nocturia should always kept in mind).\n- Recent foreign travel and exposure to environmental pathogens through recreational activities or pets.\n- Sex life, obstetric/gynecological history and so on as appropriate.\n\n## Review of systems\n- Review a list of possible symptoms that the patient may have noted in each of the body systems. Systematic questioning about different organ systems. Whatever system a specific condition may seem restricted to, it may be reasonable to review all the other systems in a comprehensive history.

{"guideline_text": "Human T-lymphotropic virus\n\n# Overview\nHuman T-lymphotropic virus (HTLV) is a human, single-stranded RNA retrovirus that causes T-cell leukemia and T-cell lymphoma in adults and may also be involved in certain demyelinating diseases, including tropical spastic paraparesis. Adult T-lymphotropic virus (ATLV) is a strain of this disease that affects primarily adults. A closely related virus is bovine leukemia virus BLV.\n\n# HTLV-I\nHTLV-I is an abbreviation for the human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1, also called the Adult T-cell lymphoma virus type 1, a virus that has been seriously implicated in several kinds of diseases including HTLV-I-associated myelopathy, Strongyloides stercoralis hyper-infection, and a virus cancer link for leukemia (see adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma). Between one in twenty and one in twenty-five infected persons are thought to develop cancer as a result of the virus.\nHTLV was discovered in 1977 in Japan. The virus was first isolated by Drs. Bernard Poiesz and Francis Ruscetti and their co-workers in the laboratory of Robert C. Gallo at the NCI. It was the first identified human retrovirus.\nInfection with HTLV-I, like infection with other retroviruses, probably occurs for life and can be inferred when antibody against HTLV-1 is detected in the serum.\n\n## Prevalence\nHTLV-I infection in the United States appears to be about half as prevalent as HIV infection among IV drug users and about one-tenth as prevalent in the population at large. Although little serologic data exist, prevalence of infection is thought to be highest among blacks living in the Southeast. A prevalence rate of 30% has been found among black intravenous drug abusers in New Jersey, and a rate of 49% has been found in a similar group in New Orleans. It is possible that prevalence of infection is increasing in this risk group.\nHTLV-I infection in Australia is very high among the Indigenous peoples of central and northern Australia, with a prevalence rate of 10-30%. It is also high among the Inuit of Northern Canada.\nStudies of HTLV-I antibody indicate that the virus is endemic in southern Japan, in northeastern Iran\n, in Peru, in the Pacific coast of Colombia and Ecuador, in the Caribbean, and in Africa.\n\n## Transmission\nTransmission of HTLV-I is believed to occur from mother to child via breastfeeding; by sexual contact; and through exposure to contaminated blood, either through blood transfusion or sharing of contaminated needles. The importance of the various routes of transmission is believed to vary geographically.\n- In Japan, the geographic clustering of infection and the rarity of unprotected sexual contact suggest that the virus is more dependent on mother-to-child transmission.\n- In the Caribbean, the geographic distribution of the virus is more uniform, and it is more common among those with many sexual partners, indicating that sexual transmission is more common.\n\n## Opportunistic infections\nIndividuals infected with HTLV-1 are at risk for opportunistic infections, diseases not caused by the virus itself, but by alterations in the host's immune functions.\n\n### Mechanism\nHTLV-1, unlike the distantly related retrovirus HIV, has an immunostimulating effect, which, however, turns out to be immunosuppressive. The virus activates a subset of T-helper cells called Th1 cells. The result is a proliferation of Th1 cells and overproduction of Th1 related cytokines (mainly IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha). Feedback mechanisms of these cytokines cause a suppression of the Th2 lymphocytes and a reduction of Th2 cytokine production (maily IL-4, IL-5, IL-10 and IL-13). The end result is a reduction in the ability of the infected host to mount an adequate immune response to invading organisms that require a predominantly Th2 dependant response (these include parasitic infections and production of mucosal and humoral antibodies).\n\n### Examples\nIn the central Australian Aboriginal population, HTLV-1 is thought to be related to their extremely high rate of death from sepsis.\nIt is particularly associated with bronchiectasis, a chronic lung condition predisposing to recurrent pneumonia.\nIt is also associated with chronic infected dermatitis, often superinfected with Staphylococcus aureus and a severe form of Strongyloides stercoralis infection called hyper-infection which may lead to death from polymicrobial sepsis.\nHTLV-1 is also associated with adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma, and has been quite well studied in Japan.  The time between infection and onset of cancer also varies geographically. It is believed to be about sixty years in Japan, and less than forty years in the Caribbean. The cancer is thought to be due to the pro-oncogenic effect of viral DNA incorporated into host lymphocyte DNA, and chronic stimulation of the lymphocytes at the cytokine level may play a role in development of malignancy. The malignancy ranges from a very indolent and slowly progressive lymphoma to a very aggressive and nearly uniformaly lethal proliferative lymphoma. Treatment varies depending on the type of disease and varies from careful observation to aggressive chemotherapy and antiretroviral agents.\nHTLV-1 is also associated with a progressive demyelinating upper motor neurone disease known as HAM/TSP for HTLV-1 associated myelopathy/Tropical Spastic Paparparesis characterized by sensory and motor deficits, particularly of the lower extremities, incontinence and impotence.  Less that 2% of infected individuals develop HAM/TSP, but this will vary dramatically from one geographic location to another.\n\n# HTLV-II\nA virus closely related to HTLV-I, HTLV-II shares approximately 70% genomic homology (structural similarity) with HTLV-I.\nIt is found predominantly in IV drug users and Native Americans, as well as Caribbean and South American Indian groups.\nHTLV-II has not been clearly linked to any disease, but has been associated with several cases of myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP)- like neurological disease.\n\n# HTLV-III and HTLV-IV\nThe terms \"HTLV-III\" and \"HTLV-IV\" have been used to describe recently characterized viruses.\nThese viruses were discovered in 2005 in rural Cameroon, and were apparently transmitted from monkeys to hunters of monkeys through bites and scratches. HTLV-III is similar to STLV-III (Simian T-lymphotropic virus 3), but HTLV-IV does not resemble any known virus. It is not yet known how much further transmission has occurred among humans, or whether the  viruses can cause disease.\nThe use of these names can cause some confusion, because the name HTLV-III was the former name of HIV in early AIDS literature, but has since fallen out of use.. Also, the name HTLV-IV has been used to describe HIV-2.", "source": "wikidoc", "question": "According to authoritative guidelines, discuss the principal modes of HTLV‑1 transmission, the populations and geographic regions at highest prevalence, and the major clinical syndromes and mechanisms (including how HTLV‑1–related immune dysregulation leads to opportunistic infections and malignancy) that clinicians should recognize."}

{"guideline_text": "Niaprazine\n\n# Overview\nNiaprazine (Nopron) is a sedative-hypnotic drug of the phenylpiperazine class. It has been used in the treatment of sleep disturbances since the early 1970s in several European countries, including France, Italy, and Luxembourg. It is commonly used with children and adolescents on account of its favorable safety and tolerability profile and lack of abuse potential.\nOriginally believed to act as an antihistamine and anticholinergic, niaprazine was later discovered to have no significant binding affinity for either the H1 or the mACh receptors (Ki = > 1 μM), and was instead found to act as a potent and selective 5-HT2A and α1-adrenergic receptor antagonist (Ki = 75 nM and 86 nM, respectively). It is virtually inactive at 5-HT1A, 5-HT2B, D2, and β-adrenergic, as well as at SERT and VMAT (Ki = all > 1 μM), but it does have some weak affinity for the α2-adrenergic receptor (Ki = 730 nM), likely acting as an antagonist there as well.\nNiaprazine has been shown to metabolize to the compound pFPP in a similar manner to how trazodone and nefazodone metabolize to mCPP. It is unclear what role, if any, pFPP plays in the clinical effects of niaprazine.

{"guideline_text": "Therapeutic embolization\n\n# Overview\nEmbolization is a non-surgical, minimally-invasive procedure performed by an interventional cardiologist or interventional radiologist and interventional neuroradiologists. It involves the selective occlusion of blood vessels, by purposely introducing emboli.\n\n# Therapeutic Applications\nEmbolization is used to treat a wide variety of conditions affecting different organs of the human body.\n\n## Hemorrhage\nThe treatment is used to occlude:\n- AVMs\n- Cerebral aneurysm\n- Gastrointestinal bleeding\n- Epistaxis\n\n## Growths\n- In the liver, typically HCC lesions.  Either by infarction or TACE (Transcatheter arterial chemoembolization).\n- Kidney lesions\n- Uterine fibroids\n\n# The Procedure\nThe procedure is a minimally-invasive alternative to surgery. The purpose of therapeutic embolization is to prevent blood flow to an area of the body, which effectively can shrink a tumor or block an aneurysm.\nThe procedure is carried out as an endovascular procedure, by an Interventional Cardiologist or a Consultant Radiologist in an Interventional Suite. It is common for most patients to have the treatment carried out with little or no sedation, although this depends largely on the organ to be embolized. Patients who undergo Cerebral Embolization or Portal Vein Embolization are usually given a general anesthetic.\nAccess to the organ in question is acquired by means of a guide wire and catheter(s). Depending on the organ this can be very difficult and time consuming. The position of the correct artery or vein supplying the pathology in question is located by Digital subtraction angiography or DSA. These images are then used as a map for the radiologist to gain access to the correct vessel by selecting an appropriate catheter and or wire, depending on the 'shape' of the surrounding anatomy.\nOnce in place, the treatment can begin. The artificial embolus used is usually one of three things:\n- Coils: Guglielmi Detachable Coil or Hydrocoil\n- Particles\n- Foam\nOnce the artificial emboli have been successfully introduced, another set of DSA images are taken to confirm a successful deployment.\n\n# Advantages\n- Minimally invasive\n- No scarring\n- Minimal risk of infection\n- No or rare use of general anaesthetic\n- Faster recovery time\n\n# Disadvantages\n- User dependent success rate\n- Risk of emboli reaching healthy tissue\n- Not suitable for everyone", "source": "wikidoc", "question": "According to authoritative guidelines on therapeutic embolization, discuss how you would select and plan embolization for (a) a patient with a liver tumour (e.g., HCC) and (b) a patient with acute gastrointestinal bleeding, addressing indications, choice of embolic agent (coils, particles, foam), anaesthesia and access considerations, key intra‑procedural imaging and technical steps, and the principal advantages and risks to communicate to the patient."}
{"guideline_text": "Airborne (dietary supplement)\nAirborne is a dietary supplement and health formula which is claimed to help ward off harmful bacteria and germs, and help prevent the flu and the common cold.  The formula contains herbal extracts, amino acids, antioxidants, electrolytes, vitamins, and other nutrients, and can be purchased in many U.S. retail stores over-the-counter in three different forms:  a tablet which can be taken orally or dissolved in water, a chewable \"Gummi\" lozenge, or a concentrate powder.\n\n# Invention and retail success\nThe formula for Airborne was developed by Victoria Knight-McDowell, an elementary school teacher from Carmel, California.  In the early 1990s, she began brewing herbal and vitamin cocktails (in hopes of warding off the germs spread by her second-grade students), \"experimenting with vitamins C, E, and A, as well as zinc, selenium, and herbs including forsythia, ginger, isatis root, and echinacea.\"  When she felt she had developed an effective preventive formula against colds, Knight-McDowell began selling it in tablet form to local drug stores.  Over the next few years, largely by word-of-mouth, the formula's popularity grew. In 1997 specialty grocery chain Trader Joe's ordered 300 cases of Airborne tablets to sell, and by 1999 other larger chains, such as Wal-Mart and Rite Aid, began stocking Airborne. It has been ranked the #1 cold and flu remedy at Drugstore.com and is considered one of the fastest selling health products in retail history.\n\n# Testing, research, and controversy\nAlthough it is recommended that Airborne be taken \"at the first sign of a cold symptom, or before entering crowded environments, like airplanes and offices,\" the package explicitly states that Airborne is \"not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.\"  This is because Airborne has not undergone any testing by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and Knight-McDowell Labs would be violating FDA regulations on Structure/Function claims were they to state on the packaging that it cured or prevented any disease.\n\n## Effectiveness studies\nScientific studies supporting Airborne's effectiveness are few in number. The study often referenced in favor of Airborne was sponsored by the Knight-McDowell Labs, manufacturers of Airborne. \"GNG Pharmaceutical Services Inc.\", claims to have conducted this study with 120 people, and reported that 47% of Airborne recipients showed little or no cold or flu symptoms, whereas only 23% of the recipients of a placebo pill showed equal results.  However, in February of 2006, ABC News discovered that GNG Pharmaceutical Services has no official clinic, scientists, or even doctors.  In fact the company comprises only two men, who started the company just to perform this study.  Because of the bad publicity that this controversy has brought forth, Knight-McDowell Labs has removed all references to the study from their packaging and web site.\nFor full article on Vitamin C and the debate over its appropriate dosages, see Vitamin C.\nA medical report on drugs and therapeutics regarding Airborne, along with its emphasis that the evidence of cold prevention or treatment of the formula is inconclusive, gives reason to believe that the supplement is unsafe as directed, specifically regarding its excess of vitamin C:\nThere are some concerns.  First, there is no conclusive evidence that this product or any of its ingredients prevents colds or shortens their duration. Second, the adult tablet contains 1 g of vitamin C, and the directions for use advise taking 1 tablet at the first sign of a cold and repeating the dose every 3 hours as necessary.  Vitamin C in doses higher than 1 g increases oxalate and urate excretion and may cause kidney stones (EN Taylor et al, J Am Soc Nephrol 2004; 15:3225). Third, the safety of this herbal extraction combination has not been established. And with herbs and dietary supplements in general, we only have the manufacturers’ word on the label for what’s in them.\nIt has been determined that extreme amounts of vitamin C can lead to death, although in recent publications, the link between excess doses of vitamin C and kidney stones has been disputed along with severe constipation and blood in stool.  However, Airborne's 5,000 IUs of vitamin A per serving has become another major health concern. The recommended safe upper limit for vitamin A is 10,000 IUs daily.  This amount is easily exceeded when following Airborne's directions, as it is stated on the packaging, to \"repeat every three hours as necessary\" (with a maximum of three doses per day).\nPregnant women especially are advised to exercise extreme caution regarding Airborne consumption. Excess preformed vitamin A (from as little as only twice the daily recommended amount) during early pregnancy has been associated with a significant increase in life-threatening birth defects.  Vitamin A is indeed necessary for fetal development, but most women already carry stores of it in their fat cells.  Researchers recommend that pregnant women either restrict their supplemental consumption of vitamin A to 4,000 - 8,000 IUs daily, or they should instead consume beta carotene.\n\n# Supplement facts and ingredients\nFollowing are the supplement facts of the original Airborne tablet.

{"guideline_text": "Minimally invasive sacroiliac joint fusion surgery for chronic sacroiliac pain\n\nEvidence-based recommendations on minimally invasive sacroiliac joint fusion surgery for chronic sacroiliac pain in adults. This involves fixing the sacrum to the ilium using 2 or 3 metal implants.\n\n# Recommendations\nCurrent evidence on the safety and efficacy of minimally invasive sacroiliac (SI) joint fusion surgery for chronic SI pain is adequate to support the use of this procedure provided that standard arrangements are in place for clinical governance, consent and audit. Find out what standard arrangements mean on the NICE interventional procedures guidance page.\nPatients having this procedure should have a confirmed diagnosis of unilateral or bilateral SI joint dysfunction due to degenerative sacroiliitis or SI joint disruption.\nThis technically challenging procedure should only be done by surgeons who regularly use image-guided surgery for implant placement. The surgeons should also have had specific training and expertise in minimally invasive SI joint fusion surgery for chronic SI pain.# Indications and current treatments\nChronic pain in the lower back triggered from the sacroiliac (SI) joint occurs in 15% to 30% of patients with low back pain. The causes of SI joint pain include degenerative sacroiliitis, osteoarthritis, SI joint disruptions from trauma or pregnancy, problems after lumbar spinal fixation techniques, anatomical abnormalities such as scoliosis, infection, gout, tumour or idiopathic causes.\nConservative treatments for SI joint pain include analgesics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, physiotherapy, manipulative therapy, intra-articular SI joint corticosteroid injections, periarticular injections, botulinum toxin injections and radiofrequency denervation. Surgical treatment is considered for persistent chronic symptoms that are unresponsive to conservative treatment. Surgical techniques include open SI joint fusion surgery or minimally invasive SI joint fusion using percutaneous implants to stabilise the joint and treat joint pain.# The procedure\nMinimally invasive surgical fusion of the sacroiliac (SI) joint is done with the patient under general or spinal anaesthesia and in a prone position. Fluoroscopic guidance is used. Using a lateral transarticular approach, the SI joint is accessed laterally through a small incision made in the buttock to reach the ilium. A pin is passed through the ilium across the SI joint into the centre of the sacrum, avoiding the neural foramen. A drill is then used to create a pathway through the ilium to the sacrum. An implant is inserted (with the lateral portion of the implant sitting in the ilium and the medial end in the sacrum), spanning the SI joint. Typically, 3 implants are used.\nTreatment of both SI joints can be done at the same time, or in staged procedures. After surgery, patients are advised to make a gradual return to full weight bearing over several weeks, using a walker for assistance, and then have physiotherapy.# Efficacy\nThis section describes efficacy outcomes from the published literature that the committee considered as part of the evidence about this procedure. For more detailed information on the evidence, see the interventional procedures overview.\nIn a randomised controlled trial (RCT) of 148 patients with sacroiliac (SI) joint dysfunction comparing minimally invasive SI joint fusion (n=102) with non-surgical management (NSM, n=46), success rates at 6 months were higher in the minimally invasive SI joint fusion group (81%  versus 26% ; Bayesian posterior probability of superiority >0.9999). (Success was defined as a composite of pain reduction from baseline visual analogue scale  pain score by at least 20 mm, absence of device-related serious adverse events or neurological worsening, and absence of surgical re-intervention.) In a prospective case series of 172 patients, intention-to-treat success rate was 80% (119/149) at 24 months (Bayesian posterior probability of superiority >0.9999).\nIn a systematic review of SI joint fusion in 430 patients, in those who had minimally invasive SI joint fusion (n=299), radiographically confirmed fusion rates (determined by CT or plain radiograph) were 13% to 100% (in 4 out of 9 studies) at a mean follow-up of 21 months. In the prospective case series of 172 patients, CT scan at 1‑year follow-up showed 97% bone adherence to at least 2 implants on both the iliac and sacral sides, with moderate rates of bone growth across the SI joint.\nIn the RCT of 148 patients, in the SI joint fusion group (n=102), mean joint pain (measured using a 0–100 VAS) improved from 82.3 at baseline to 30.4 at 6‑month follow-up (p<0.001), 28.3 at 12‑month follow-up (p<0.001) and 26.7 at the 24‑month follow-up (p<0.001). In the NSM group, mean SI joint pain improved from 82.2 at baseline to 70.3 at 6 months (p=0.001). Similarly, in the SI joint fusion group, mean Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) decreased from 57.2 at baseline to 29.9 at 6 months (p<0.001), 28.1 at 12 months (p<0.001) and 28.7 at 24 months (p<0.001). In the NSM group, mean ODI decreased from 56.0 at baseline to 51.6 at 6 months (p=0.06). There were clinically important improvements from baseline (VAS more than 20.0 points; ODI more than 15.0 points) and sustained clinical benefit (VAS more than 25.0 or less than 35.0 points; ODI more than 18.8 points) in the SI joint fusion group compared with patients in the NSM group.\nIn a systematic review and meta-analysis of 432 patients on minimally invasive SI joint fusion using a lateral transarticular approach, the random effects meta-analysis (RMA) mean pain score decreased from a baseline of 8.1 (95% confidence interval  7.8 to 8.4) to 2.8 (95% CI 2.4 to 3.2) at 6 months, 2.7 (95% CI 2.1 to 3.3) at 12 months and 2.0 (95% CI 1.4 to 2.5) at 24 months. ODI decreased from an RMA mean score of 56.6 (95% CI 51.0 to 61.5) at baseline, 30.3 (95% CI 22.5 to 38.0) at 6 months and 25.1 (95% CI 12.3 to 37.9) at 12 months.\nIn an RCT of 103 patients, SI joint function ratings (measured using the active straight leg raise test on a scale of 0 to 6) decreased statistically significantly more (p<0.0001) in the SI joint fusion group (from 4.0 to 2.0) than in the conservative management group (from 3.8 to 3.7). The proportion of patients who could raise the leg with no difficulty at 6 months was 71% in the SI joint fusion group and 32% in conservative management group (p=0.0002).\nIn the systematic review and meta-analysis of 432 patients, improvements in quality of life (measured on the SF‑36 physical component score ) were consistent in 2 studies of triangular implants; scores increased from 30.2 and 30.7 at baseline to 42.8 and 37.0 at 6 months respectively. In the RCT of 148 patients, in the SI joint fusion group (n=102), quality of life (measured with an EQ‑5D time trade‑off index utility of current health) improved from 0.44 at baseline to 0.72 at 6‑month follow-up (p<0.001), 0.74 at 12‑month follow-up (p<0.001) and 0.72 at the 24‑month follow-up (p<0.001). The mean change was only 0.05 points in the NSM group at 6 months (p=0.17). For patients who crossed over (n=35), the change was small at 6 months (0.02; p=0.66) but, after crossover, improved from 0.47 at 6 months to 0.73 at 12 months (0.26 point increase, p<0.001). In those who did not cross over (n=11), the change from 6 months to 12 months was small (p=0.008). Quality of life (measured using SF‑36) showed that mean 6‑month changes in PCS and mental health component summary scores (MCS) were statistically significant (p<0.001) in the fusion group compared with the NSM group. Patients who crossed over from NSM after 6 months had larger improvements in PCS and MCS scores compared with those who did not cross over.\nIn the systematic review of SI joint fusion of 430 patients, clinical and patient satisfaction with surgery (determined by subjective questionnaires and judged by patients' stated satisfaction with surgery) ranged from 56% to 100% in 299 patients (from 9 studies) who had minimally invasive SI joint fusion, at a mean follow-up of 21 months. In the RCT of 103 patients, satisfaction levels were higher at 3 and 6 months in the SI joint fusion group compared with the conservative management group (p<0.0001 by proportional odds logistic regression). The proportion of patients reporting that they would have the procedure again was also higher in the SI joint fusion group (p=0.0001).\nThe specialist advisers listed key efficacy outcomes as improvement in pain and function, and reduced length of hospital stay.\nEight commentaries from patients who had experience of this procedure were received, which were discussed by the committee.# Safety\nThis section describes safety outcomes from the published literature that the committee considered as part of the evidence about this procedure. For more detailed information on the evidence, see the interventional procedures overview.\nThe overall complication rate was 4% (204/5,319) in a prospective database analysis of post-marketing complaints for patients having minimally invasive sacroiliac (SI) joint fusion for degenerative sacroiliitis and SI joint disruption. Pain was the most commonly reported event (2% ), followed by nerve impingement in less than 1% (n=48) and recurrent SI joint pain in less than 1% (n=43).\nThe overall complication rate was 13% (57/432) in a systematic review and meta-analysis of 432 patients from 12 cohort studies on minimally invasive SI joint fusion using a lateral transarticular approach. The most common events were surgical wound problems (4%, 17/432), trochanteric bursitis (2%, 8/432), facet pain (less than 1%, 3/432), recurrent SI pain (less than 1%, 3/432), toe and foot numbness (less than 1%, 2/432), and nerve root impingement needing revision in 2% (9/432) patients. In a systematic review on SI joint fusion including 430 patients, for those having minimally invasive SI joint fusion (n=299 in 9 studies), complications reported were new-onset facet joint pain, trochanteric bursitis, deep wound infections, new onset of low back or buttock pain, worsening knee or leg pain, superficial cellulitis, radiculopathy, large haematomas, vascular necrosis of the hip, piriformis syndrome, implant penetration into the sacral neural foramen, peripheral neuropathy, a non-displaced fracture, pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis.\nThe device-related adverse event rate was 1% (75/5,319) in the prospective database analysis of post-marketing complaints. These were related to issues with binding, bending or breakage of the Steinmann pin (n=43), pin advancement difficulties (n=14), radiographic halo (n=13) and device migration (n=4). In a randomised controlled trial (RCT) of 148 patients, device-related events were reported in 3% (3/102) in the SI joint fusion group at 6‑month follow-up. Two events (1 implant-related impingement on a sacral nerve causing pain and needing immediate revision and 1 hairline ilium fracture adjacent to implant causing pain resolved after revision surgery) were definitely related to the device and 1 event (SI joint pain because of suboptimal placement of implants, which needed revision surgery) was deemed probably related to the device.\nThe procedure-related adverse event rate was 2% (108/5,319) in the prospective database analysis of post-marketing complaints. Improper implant placement was reported in 1% (n=72) of patients. Improper device length was reported in less than 1% (n=36) of patients, with most implants deemed to be too short (n=30). In the RCT of 148 patients, 19% (19/102) of the events were probably or definitely related to the SI joint fusion and 11% (5/46) of the events were related to non-surgical management (NSM) at 6‑month follow-up. Events related to surgical procedure included neuropathic symptoms (n=1), postoperative medical problems (n=4; urinary retention, nausea/vomiting, atrial fibrillation), SI joint pain or trochanteric bursitis (n=7), surgical wound problems (n=5), iliac fracture (n=1) and asymptomatic physical examination findings (n=1). With NSM, 3 patients reported SI joint pain after treatment; 1 had flushing and shortness of breath after SI joint injection and 1 had worsening SI joint pain related to physiotherapy.\nThe revision rate was 2% (9/432) in the systematic review and meta-analysis of 432 patients. Reoperation rate ranged from 0% to 17% (mean 6%) in the 299 patients who had minimally invasive SI joint fusion surgery in the systematic review of 430 patients (in 9 studies; mean follow-up of 21 months). In the prospective database analysis of post-marketing complaints, the reoperation rate was 2% (n=96/5,319) at a median follow-up of 4 months. Revisions were typically done in the early postoperative period (median 19 days) for treatment of a symptomatic wrongly positioned implant (less than 1%, n=46), or to correct an improperly sized implant in an asymptomatic patient (less than 1%, n=10). Revisions in the late postoperative period were done (at a median of 297 days) to treat symptom recurrence (n=34) or for continued pain of undetermined aetiology (n=6). Revision outcomes and management in these patients were not reported.\nPostoperative infection rate was 4% (n=19) at 6 months in a retrospective analysis of 469 patients treated by minimally invasive SI joint fusion.\nIn addition to safety outcomes reported in the literature, specialist advisers are asked about anecdotal adverse events (events which they have heard about) and about theoretical adverse events (events which they think might possibly occur, even if they have never done so). For this procedure, specialist advisers listed the following anecdotal adverse events: non-union and implant loosening, which would be similar to pseudoarthrosis. They considered that the following were theoretical adverse events: residual pain and injury to L5 or sacral nerve roots by wrong positioning of the screw (implant).\nEight commentaries from patients who had experience of this procedure were received, which were discussed by the committee.# Further information\nFor related NICE guidance, see the NICE website.\nPatient commentaries supported use of the procedure. They were largely positive and many patients described having pain relief.\n\n# Information for patients\nNICE has produced information on this procedure for patients and carers (Information for the public).

{"guideline_text": "AIDS pandemic\n\n# Overview\nAcquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) has led to the deaths of more than 25 million people since it was first recognized in 1981, making it one of the most destructive epidemics in recorded history. Despite recent improved access to antiretroviral treatment and care in many regions of the world, the AIDS epidemic claimed approximately 3.1 million (between 2.8 and 3.6 million) lives in 2005 (an average of 8,500 per day), of which 570,000 were children.\nUNAIDS and the WHO estimate that the total number of people living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has reached its highest level. There are an estimated 40.3 million (estimated range between 36.7 and 45.3 million) people now living with HIV. Moreover, almost 5 million people have been estimated to have been infected with HIV in 2005 alone.\nRegarding the social effects of the HIV/AIDS pandemic, there has been since the 1980s a \"profound re-medicalization of sexuality\".\nThe pandemic is not homogeneous within regions with some countries more afflicted than others. Even at the country level there are wide variations in infection levels between different areas. The number of people living with HIV continues to rise in most parts of the world, despite strenuous prevention strategies. Sub-Saharan Africa remains by far the worst-affected region, with 23.8 million to 28.9 million people living with HIV at the end of 2005, 1 million more than in 2003. Sixty-four percent of all people living with HIV are in sub-Saharan Africa, as are more than 77% of all women living with HIV.

The adult (15-49) HIV prevalence rate is 7.2% (range: 6.6 - 8.0%) with between 23.8 and 28.9 million people currently living with HIV. However, it must be noted that the actual prevalence does vary between regions. Presently, Southern Africa is the hardest hit region, with adult prevalence rates exceeding 20% in most countries in the region, and even 30% in Swaziland and Botswana. Eastern Africa also experiences relatively high levels of prevalence with estimates above 10% in some countries, although there are signs that the pandemic is declining in this region, notably in Uganda which previously recorded one of the highest prevalence rates on the continent. West Africa on the other hand has been much less affected by the pandemic, several countries reportedly have prevalence rates around 2-3% and no country has yet rates above 10%, although in two of the region's most populous countries, Nigeria and Côte d'Ivoire, between 5 and 7% of adults are reported to carry the virus. \nAcross Sub-Saharan Africa, more women are infected with HIV than men, with 13 women living with HIV for every 10 infected men and the gap continues to grow. Throughout the region, women are being infected with HIV at earlier ages than men. The differences in infection levels between women and men are most pronounced among young people (aged 15–24 years). In this age group, there are 36 women living with HIV for every 10 men. The widespread prevalence of sexually transmitted diseases, the practice of scarification, transfusion, and the poor state of hygiene and nutrition in Africa may all be facilitating factors in the transmission of HIV-1 in this region (Bentwich et al., 1995). In 2000, the World Health Organization estimated that 25% of the units of blood transfused in Africa were not tested for HIV, and that 5–10% of HIV infections in Africa were transmitted via blood .\nPoor economic conditions (leading to the use of dirty needles in healthcare clinics) and lack of sex education contribute to high rates of infection. In some African countries, 25% or more of the working adult population is HIV-positive; in Botswana the figure was 35.8% (1999 estimate World Press Review), the highest reported infection rate in the world.\nIn South Africa, President Thabo Mbeki has questioned in the past the connection between HIV and AIDS - instead hinting at the possibility of factors such as undernourishment being one of the causes of the disease. While South Africa has created preventative programs and research initiatives to address its HIV problem, critics charge that the South African government has been slow to create antiretroviral programs and take other effective medical steps to stop the epidemic. UNAIDS estimates that in 2005 there were 5.5 million people in South Africa living with HIV — 12.4% of the population.  This was an increase of 200,000 people since 2003.\nAlthough HIV infection rates are much lower in Nigeria than in other African countries, the size of Nigeria's population meant that by the end of 2003, there were an estimated 3.6 million people living with HIV.  On the other hand, Uganda, Zambia, Senegal, and most recently Botswana have begun intervention and educational measures to slow the spread of HIV, and Uganda has succeeded in actually reducing its HIV infection rate\n\n# Middle East and North Africa\nThe prevalence in this area is 0.2% (0.1-0.7%), with between 230,000 and 1.4 million people infected. In this area, the routes of transmission of HIV is diverse, including paid sex, sex between men and injecting drug use. Among young people 15–24 years of age, 0.3% of women  and 0.1% of men  were living with HIV by the end of 2004.\n\n# South and South-East Asia\nThe HIV prevalence rate across this region is less than .35 percent. Due to the population size this brings the total of HIV infections to 4.2 - 4.7 million adults and children. More AIDS deaths (480,000) occur in this region than any other region except sub-Saharan Africa. This sprawling region is not just vast but diverse, with the nature, pace and severity of HIV epidemics differing across the region. The AIDS picture in South Asia is dominated by the epidemic in India, but new data released by UNAIDS shows that India as of 2007 has a relatively low Aids prevalence rate. With an estimated 2-3.1 million infections, India has the third largest number of people with aids after South Africa and Nigeria.  In South and Southeast Asia, the HIV epidemic remains largely concentrated in injecting drug users, men who have sex with men, sex workers, and clients of sex workers and their immediate sexual partners. New infections occur in Thailand and Cambodia at a steady rate. Prevention strategies in these populations are, for the most part, inadequate.\n\n# East Asia\nThe national HIV prevalence levels in East Asia is 0.1% in the adult (15-49) group. However, due to the large populations of many East Asian nations, this low national HIV prevalence still means that large numbers of people are living with HIV.  The picture in this region is dominated by China. Much of the current spread of HIV in China is through injecting drug use and paid sex. In China, the number was estimated at between 430,000 and 1.5 million by independent researchers, with some estimates going much higher. In the rural areas of China, where large numbers of farmers, especially in Henan province, participated in unclean blood transfusions; estimates of those infected are in the tens of thousands. In Japan, just over half of HIV/AIDS cases are officially recorded as occurring amongst homosexual men, with the remainder occurring amongst heterosexuals and also via drug abuse, in the womb or unknown means.\n\n# Latin America\nIn this region, only Guatemala and Honduras have national HIV prevalence of over 1%. In these countries, HIV-infected men outnumber HIV-infected women by roughly 3:1. Lower prevalence in other countries disguises serious, localized epidemics. In Mexico, Brazil, Colombia and Argentina, drug injection and homosexual activity are the main modes of transmission, but there is concern that heterosexual activity may soon become a primary method of spreading the virus. Brazil accounts for more than a third of all HIV infections in Latin America, with the routes of transmission including paid sex, sex between men and injecting drug use. Brazil began in the 1980s a comprehensive AIDS prevention and treatment programme to keep AIDS in check, including the production of generic versions of anti-retroviral drugs.\n\n# Caribbean\nThe Caribbean is the second-most affected region in the world. Among adults aged 15–44, AIDS has become the leading cause of death. The adult prevalence rate is between 1.1% and 2.7%. HIV transmission occurs largely through heterosexual intercourse, with two thirds of AIDS cases in this region attributed to this route. Sex between men is also a significant route of transmission, even though it is heavily stigmatised and illegal in many areas. HIV transmission through injecting drug use remains rare, except in Bermuda and Puerto Rico.\n\n# Eastern Europe and Central Asia\nThere is also growing concern about a rapidly growing epidemic in Eastern Europe and Central Asia, where an estimated 0.99-2.3 million people were infected in December 2005, though the adult (15-49) prevalence rate is low (0.9%). The rate of HIV infections began to grow rapidly from the mid-1990s, due to social and economic collapse, increased levels of intravenous drug use and increased numbers of prostitutes. By 2004 the number of reported cases in Russia was over 257,000, according to the World Health Organization, up from 15,000 in 1995 and 190,000 in 2002; some estimates claim the real number is up to five times higher, over 1 million. There are predictions that the infection rate in Russia will continue to rise quickly, since education there about AIDS is almost non-existent. Ukraine and Estonia also had growing numbers of infected people, with estimates of 500,000 and 3,700 respectively in 2004. The epidemic is still in its early stages in this region, which means that prevention strategies may be able to halt and reverse this epidemic. However, transmission of HIV is increasing through sexual contact and drug use among the young (<30 years). Indeed, over 80% of current infections occur in this region in people less than 30 years of age.\n\n# Western Europe\nIn most Western countries, AIDS cases have fallen to levels not seen since the original outbreak; many attribute this trend to aggressive educational campaigns, screening of blood transfusions and increased use of condoms. Also, the death rate from AIDS in Western Europe has fallen sharply, as new AIDS therapies have proven to be an effective (if expensive) means of suppressing HIV.\nIn this area, the routes of transmission of HIV is diverse, including paid sex, sex between men, injecting drug use, mother to child and heterosexual sex. However, many new infections in this region occur through contact with HIV-infected individuals from other regions. The adult (15-49) prevalence in this region is 0.3% with between 570,000 and 890,000 people currently living with HIV. Due to the availability of antiretroviral therapy, AIDS deaths have stayed low since the lows of the late 1990s. However, in some countries, a large share of HIV infections remain undiagnosed and there is worrying evidence of antiretroviral drug resistance among some newly HIV-infected individuals in this region. Also, there has been a recent increase in risky behavior among men who have sex with men.\n\n# North America\n\n## United States\nThe adult prevalence rate in this region is 0.7% with over 1 million people currently living with HIV. In the United States, sex between men (49%), heterosexual sex (32%) and needle sharing by intravenous drug users (14%) remain prominent sources of new HIV infections . Currently, rates of HIV infection in the US are highest in the eastern and southern regions, with the exception of California. Currently, between 35,000 to 40,000 new infections occur in the USA every year. AIDS is one of the top three causes of death for African American men aged 25–54 and for African American women aged 35–44 years in the United States of America. In the United States, African Americans make up about 47% of the total HIV-positive population and make up more than half of new HIV cases, despite making up only 12% of the population. AIDS continues to be a problem with illegal sex workers and injecting drug users.  The main route of transmission for women is through heterosexual sex, and the main risk factor for them is non-protection and the undisclosed risky behaviour of their sexual partners. African American women are 19 times more likely to contract HIV than white women . Experts attribute this to \"AIDS fatigue\" among younger people who have no memory of the worst phase of the epidemic in the 1980s and early 1990s, as well as \"condom fatigue\" among those who have grown tired of and disillusioned with the unrelenting safer sex message. This trend is of major concern to public health workers.\nIn the United States in particular, a new wave of infection is being blamed on the use of methamphetamine, known as crystal meth. Research presented at the 12th Annual Retrovirus Conference in Boston in February 2005 concluded that using crystal meth or cocaine is the biggest single risk factor for becoming HIV+ among US gay men, contributing 29% of the overall risk of becoming positive and 28% of the overall risk of being the receptive partner in anal sex .  In addition, several renowned clinical psychologists now cite crystal as the biggest problem facing gay men today, including Michael Majeski, who reckons meth is the catalyst for at least 80% of seroconversions currently occurring across the United States, and Tony Zimbardi, who calls crystal the number one cause of HIV transmission, and says that high rates of new HIV infection are not being found among non-crystal users.  In addition, various HIV and STD clinics across the United States report anecdotal evidence that 75% of new HIV seroconversions they deal with are crystal-related; indeed, in Los Angeles, crystal is regarded as the main cause of HIV seroconversion among gay men in their late thirties.  The First National Conference on Methamphetamine, HIV and Hepatitis took place in Salt Lake City in August of 2005.\nOn the other hand, as in Western Europe, the death rate from AIDS in North America has fallen sharply, as new AIDS therapies have proven to be an effective (if expensive) means of suppressing HIV.\n\n# Oceania\nThere is a very large range of national situations regarding AIDS and HIV in this region. This is due, in part, to the large distances between the islands of Oceania. The wide range of development in the region also plays an important role. The prevalence is estimated at between 0.2% and 0.7%, with between 45,000 and 120,000 adults and children currently living with HIV.", "source": "wikidoc", "question": "According to the provided wikidoc overview of the AIDS pandemic, discuss the regional variations in HIV prevalence and predominant transmission routes, analyze the principal social, economic and healthcare factors identified as driving high prevalence in the worst-affected regions, and outline the public-health interventions implied by the document that would be expected to reduce new infections and AIDS-related deaths."}
{"guideline_text": "MSH3\nDNA mismatch repair protein, MutS Homolog 3 (MSH3) is a human homologue of the bacterial mismatch repair protein MutS that participates in the mismatch repair (MMR) system. MSH3 typically forms the heterodimer MutSβ with MSH2 in order to correct long insertion/deletion loops and base-base mispairs in microsatellites during DNA synthesis. Deficient capacity for MMR is found in approximately 15% of colorectal cancers, and somatic mutations in the MSH3 gene can be found in nearly 50% of MMR-deficient colorectal cancers.\n\n# Gene and Expression\nIn humans, the encoding gene for MSH3 is found on chromosome 5 at location 5q11-q12 upstream of the dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) gene.  MSH3 is encoded by 222,341 base pairs and creates a protein consisting of 1137 amino acids.\nMSH3 is typically expressed at low levels in several transformed cell lines—including HeLa, K562, HL-60, and CEM—as well as a large range of normal tissues including spleen, thymus, prostate, testis, ovary, small intestine, colon, peripheral blood leukocytes, heart, brain, placenta, lung, liver, skeletal muscle kidney, and pancreas. Although expression levels of MSH3 vary slightly from tissue to tissue, its widespread low-level expression indicates that it is a “housekeeping” gene commonly expressed in all cells.\nOver-expression of MSH3 decreased capacity for MMR. When MSH3 is over expressed, drastic changes occur in the relative levels of formation of MutSβ at the expense of MutSα. MutSα is responsible for base-base mispairs and short insertion/deletion loops, while MutSβ repairs long insertion/deletion loops in DNA. A drastic shift in the relative levels of these protein complexes can lead to diminished capacity for MMR. In the case of MSH3 overexpression, MSH2 preferentially heterodimerizes with MSH3 leading to high levels of MutSβ and degradation of the partnerless MSH6 protein which normally complexes with MSH2 to form MutSα.\n\n# Interactions\nMSH3 has been shown to interact with MSH2, PCNA, and BRCA1. These interactions form protein complexes that are typically involved in tumor suppression and DNA repair activities.\nThe primary interaction of MSH3 involves forming the MutSβ complex with MSH2. MutSβ forms as a heterodimer of MSH2 and MSH3 with two primary interaction regions: an amino-terminal region and a carboxy-terminal region. The N-terminal region of MSH3 (amino acids 126-250) contact the N-terminal region of MSH2 aa 378-625. The C-terminal regions connect at aa 1050-1128 of MSH3 and aa 875-934 of MSH2. The binding regions on MSH2 are identical when binding to either MSH3 or MSH6. Adenine nucleotide binding regions in MSH3 and MSH2 are not contained in either of the interaction regions involved in dimerization, allowing MutSβ to bind to DNA and perform MMR.\nProliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) is a protein involved in post-replication MMR. It has been shown that PCNA binds to the MutSβ heterodimer via a binding motif in the N-terminal domain of MSH3. Bound PCNA then localizes the MutSβ complex to replication foci, indicating that PCNA assists in initiating repair by guiding MutSβ and other repair proteins to free termini in recently replicated DNA.\n\n# Function\nThe primary function of MSH3 is to maintain the stability of the genome and enact tumor suppression by forming the heterodimer MutSβ to correct long insertion/deletion loops and base-base mispairs. In the case of long insertion/deletion loops, DNA is severely bent and downstream basepairs can become unpaired and exposed. MutSβ recognizes insertion/deletion loops of 1-15 nucleotides; binding to insertion/deletion loops is achieved by inserting the mismatch-binding domain of MSH3 and part of the mismatch-binding domain of MSH2 into the groove formed by the extreme bend in DNA formed by the insertion/deletion loop.\n\n# Role in Cancer\nThe most significant role of MSH3 in cancer is the suppression of tumors by repair of somatic mutations in DNA that occur as the result of base-base mispairs and insertion/deletion loops. Both loss of expression and over expression of MSH3 can lead to carcinogenic effects.\nOver-expression of MSH3 can lead to drastic changes in the relative e levels of MutSα and MutSβ. Normally, MutSβ is expressed at relatively low levels throughout all cells while MutSα is present at high levels. While both proteins have redundant function in base-base repairs, MutSα typically effects base-base mispair repairs and also performs repairs on the more common short inertion/deletion loops. When MSH3 is heavily overexpressed, it acts as a sequester for MSH2 and the relative levels of MutSβ and MutSα shift dramatically as unpaired MSH6 proteins degrade and MutSα becomes depleted. MutSβ can compensate somewhat for loss of base-base mispair correction functions, but is not suited for repairing many short, 1-2 base pair insertion/deletion loops. This leads to a heightened rate of microsatellite instabilities and increased rates of somatic mutations.\nThis effect is directly related to human cancer in the form of drug resistance. One of the common resistance responses to methotrexate, a drug commonly used to treat childhood acute lymphocytic leukemia and a variety of other tumors, is amplification of the DHFR gene. DHFR amplification leads to overexpression of MSH3 and has been tied drug-resistant recurrence in cancer.\nIn contrast, loss of MSH3 can lead to mismatch repair deficiency and genetic instability which have been identified as particularly common carcinogenic effects in human colorectal cancer. Mutations causing MSH3 knockdown can lead to diminished capacity for cells to repair long insertion/deletion loops causing microsatellite instabilities (MSI) in the genome and allowing an increase in the rates of somatic mutation. Elevated microsatellite alterations at selected tetranucleotide repeats (EMAST) are a type of MSI where loci containing AAAG or ATAG tetranucleotide repeats are particularly unstable. EMAST phenotypes are particularly common, with nearly 60% of sporadic colorectal cancers displaying high levels of EMAST linked to a high-rate of MSH3 deficient cells in tumors.", "source": "wikidoc", "question": "According to authoritative guidelines, discuss how alterations in MSH3 expression (loss versus overexpression) contribute to colorectal cancer pathogenesis, how these alterations relate to microsatellite instability phenotypes including EMAST, and the implications for diagnosis, prognosis, and chemotherapy resistance (including the role of DHFR amplification and methotrexate resistance) in clinical management."}
{"guideline_text": "Dirithromycin\n\n# Overview\nDirithromycin is a macrolide glycopeptide antibiotic.\nDirithromycin (Dynabac) is a more lipid-soluble prodrug derivative of 9S-erythromycyclamine prepared by condensation of the latter with 2-(2-methoxyethoxy)acetaldehyde. The 9N, 11O-oxazine ring thus formed is a hemi-aminal that is unstable under both acidic and alkaline aqueous conditions and undergoes spontaneous hydrolysis to form erythromycyclamine. Erythromycyclamine is a semisynthetic derivative of erythromycin in which the 9-ketogroup of the erythronolide ring has been converted to an amino group. Erythromycyclamine retains the antibacterial properties of erythromycin oral administration. The prodrug, dirithromycin, is provided as enteric coated tablets to protect it from acid catalyzed hydrolysis in the stomach.\nOrally administered dirithromycin is absorbed rapidly into the plasma, largely from the small intestine. Spontaneous hydrolysis to erythromycyclamine occurs in the plasma. Oral bioavailability is estimated to be about 10%, but food does not affect absorption of the prodrug.\n\n# Discontinuation\nDirithromycin is no longer available in the United States. Since the production of dirithromycin is discontinued in the U.S, National Institutes of Health recommend that people taking dirithromycin should consult their physicians to discuss switching to another treatment. However, dirithromycin is still available in many european countries.", "source": "wikidoc", "question": "According to authoritative guidelines, outline how clinicians should manage an adult patient currently taking dirithromycin now that its production has been discontinued in the United States, including the assessment and counselling steps, factors to consider when selecting an alternative antibiotic (drawing on dirithromycin’s pharmacologic properties such as prodrug conversion, enteric coating, oral bioavailability and food effects), and appropriate follow-up actions."}
{"guideline_text": "Photodynamic therapy for bile duct cancer\n\n# Guidance\nCurrent evidence on the safety and efficacy of photodynamic therapy (PDT) for bile duct cancer does not appear adequate for this procedure to be used without special arrangements for consent and for audit or research.\nClinicians wishing to undertake PDT for bile duct cancer should take the following actions.\nInform the clinical governance leads in their Trusts.\nEnsure that patients understand the uncertainty about the procedure's safety and efficacy and provide them with clear written information. Use of the Institute's information for the public is recommended.\nAudit and review clinical outcomes of all patients having PDT for bile duct cancer.\nPublication of safety and efficacy outcomes will be useful. A randomised trial (PHOTOSTENT 2) is in progress and clinicians are encouraged to enter patients in this trial. The Institute may review the procedure upon publication of further evidence.# The procedure\n\n# Indications\nBile duct cancer may prevent bile flowing from the liver to the intestine. Early cancers are often asymptomatic, but as the disease advances patients may experience symptoms from biliary obstruction, such as jaundice, itchy skin, abdominal discomfort, loss of appetite, loss of weight and fever. PDT is a palliative treatment option for bile duct cancer.\nTreatment options depend on the stage, size, position and type of tumour. Bile duct cancer is not usually diagnosed before the symptoms of biliary obstruction occur, by which time the cancer may be too advanced for curative surgical resection. Options for palliative treatment include surgical bypass of the bile duct or the insertion of a stent using surgical, endoscopic or percutaneous techniques. The benefits of other palliative treatments such as radiotherapy, chemotherapy and brachytherapy are still being investigated.\n\n# Outline of the procedure\nPDT produces localised tissue necrosis. A photosensitising agent is applied that is absorbed into the tumour tissue. The area is then exposed to laser light of an appropriate wavelength.\nPDT is usually administered in conjunction with a biliary stenting procedure. The photosensitising agent is injected intravenously and photoactivation is performed approximately 48 hours later. A laser is inserted through a translucent endoscopic catheter situated close to the tumour, or it is placed directly across the tumour. Radiological control is used to ensure correct positioning of the laser fibre. Patients remain in subdued lighting for about 3 days after injection to avoid skin photosensitivity and are then gradually readapted to light. The treatment can be repeated.\n\n# Efficacy\nA randomised controlled study of 39 patients reported that those treated with PDT and biliary stenting had a significantly longer median survival time than patients treated with biliary stenting alone (493 days versus 98 days, p < 0.0001). This study was terminated prematurely because PDT was so superior to stenting alone. Several quality-of-life scores were significantly improved after PDT, including global quality of life, fatigue, itching and weight loss. No significant improvements in quality-of-life scores were reported for the patients receiving biliary stenting alone. A non-randomised study of 44 patients reported that the mean survival after PDT and biliary stenting was 16 months, compared with 12.5 months after biliary stenting alone. For more details, refer to the Sources of evidence.\nThe Specialist Advisors considered that there is not yet enough data to draw clear conclusions about the effect of PDT on survival. One Specialist Advisor stated that this procedure is only effective for tumours that are in visual proximity to the light source.\n\n# Safety\nThe most common complications were cholangitis, affecting between 15% (3/20) and 56% (13/23) of patients, and photosensitivity, which was reported in 0% (0/8) to 33% (2/6) of patients. Other reported complications included bilioma, cholecystitis, stenosis and haemobilia. For more details, refer to the Sources of evidence.\nThe Specialist Advisors stated that potential adverse effects of the procedure include cholangitis, photosensitivity, stenosis of the biliary tree, biliary perforation, acute pancreatitis, bleeding and pain.\n\n# Other comments\nIt was noted that efficacy may depend on the particular photosensitising agent used.\nThe initial evidence suggests that PDT may be an efficacious palliative technique in patients with bile duct cancer.\nAndrew DillonChief ExecutiveJuly 2005# Further information\n\n# Sources of evidence\nThe evidence considered by the Interventional Procedures Advisory Committee is described in the following document.\n'Interventional procedure overview of photodynamic therapy for bile duct cancer', October 2004.\n\n# Information for patients\nNICE has produced information on this procedure for patients and carers.

{"guideline_text": "Femur\nIn humans, it is the longest, most voluminous, and strongest bone. The average human femur is 48 centimeters (19 in) in length and 2.34 cm (0.92 in) in diameter and can support up to 30 times the weight of an adult. It forms part of the hip (at the acetabulum) and part of the knee.\nThe word femur is Latin for thigh. Theoretically in strict usage, femur bone is more proper than femur, as in classical Latin femur means \"thigh\", and os femoris means \"the bone within it\".\nIn medical Latin its genitive is always femoris, but in classical Latin its genitive is often feminis, and should not be confused with case forms of femina, which means \"woman\".\n\n# Fractures\nFemur bone fractures, on occasion, are liable to cause permanent disability because the thigh muscles pull the fragments so they overlap, and the fragments re-unite incorrectly. To avoid this, femur fracture patients should be put into traction to keep the fragments pulled into proper alignment.\nWith modern medical procedures, such as the insertion of rods and screws by way of surgery (known as Antegrade  or Retrograde  femoral rodding), those suffering from femur fractures can now generally expect to make a full recovery, though one that generally takes 3 to 6 months due to the bone's size. Patients should not put weight on the leg without permission from an orthopedic surgeon since this can delay the healing process.\nThe thigh is generally not put in a cast since the surgical hardware does the job of straightening the bone and holding the fracture together while it heals. Permanent complications with this procedure include the risk of intra-articular sepsis, arthritis and knee stiffness. After the bone is healed, there is no further need for the hardware but, while it is left in some patients permanently, those who lead an active lifesytle may experience discomfort where the hardware projects into the leg muscle and, in such cases, the hardware can be removed, most commonly by means of out-patient surgery.\n\n## Hip fracture\nIf bone is weakened, the proximal end of the femur bone near the hip joint is prone to fragility fracture.  Most at risk are European descent, post-menopausal women, and osteoporosis severely increases this risk. Out of all the bones in the skeleton, the femur takes the longest to heal. This bone is the longest and strongest bone in the human body. When the average human being jumps this bone withstands a force of half a ton just a testament to its strength.\n\n# Intercondylar Fossa\nThe intercondylar fossa is present between the condyles at the distal end of the femur. In addition to the intercondylar eminence on the tibial plateau, there is both an anterior and posterior intercondylar fossa (area), the sites of anterior cruciate and posterior cruciate ligament attachment, respectively.\n\n# In other animals\nParallel structures by the same name exist in other complex animals, such as the bone inside a ham or a leg of lamb. The name femur is also given to the most proximal full-length jointed segment of an arthropod's leg.", "source": "wikidoc", "question": "According to authoritative guidelines, discuss the management of femoral shaft fractures, addressing the rationale for initial traction, the role and choice of surgical fixation (antegrade versus retrograde femoral rodding), postoperative restrictions on weight bearing and expected time to recovery, common permanent complications, and the indications for removal of implanted hardware."}
{"guideline_text": "Sinusitis in children\nSynonyms and keywords: Sinusitis in Children, Pediatric Rhinosinusitis, Pediatric Sinusitis, Sinusitis in Kids\n\n# Overview\n- Rhinosinusitis is an inflammation of the paranasal and nasal sinus mucosae which is a very common condition encountered in children.\n\n# Historical Perspective\n- The term Rhinosinusitis was first coined by Task Force of Rhinology and Paranasal Sinus Committee in 1997 as sinusitis is invariably accompanied by rhinitis.\n\n# Classification\n- Anatomically paranasal sinuses are classified in to  paired sinuses, divided into subgroups that are named according to the bones within which the sinuses lie. The paranasal air sinuses are lined with ciliated pseudostratified columnar epithelium also known as respiratory epithelium.\n- Maxillary Sinuses, the largest of the paranasal sinuses, are under the eyes, in the maxillary bones. They are innervated by the trigeminal nerve (CN Vb)\n- Frontal Sinuses, superior to the eyes, in the frontal bone, which forms the hard part of the forehead. They are also innervated by the trigeminal nerve (CN Va)\n- Ethmoidal Sinuses, which are formed from several discrete air cells within the ethmoid bone between the nose and the eyes. They are innervated by the ethmoidal nerves, which branch from the nasociliary nerve of the trigeminal nerve (CN Va)\n- Sphenoidal Sinus, in the sphenoid bone. They are innervated by the trigeminal nerve (CN Va & Vb)\n- Sinusitis is classified into four subtypes/groups:\n- Acute Rhinosinusitis: Sudden onset, lasting less than 4 weeks with complete resolution.\n- Subacute Rhinosinusitis: A continuum of acute rhinosinusitis but less than 12 weeks.\n- Recurrent Acute Rhinosinusitis: Four or more episodes of acute, lasting at least 7 days each, in any 1-year period.\n- Chronic Rhinosinusitis: Signs of symptoms persist 12 weeks or longer.\n\n# Pathophysiology\n- Most commonly a viral upper respiratory infection causes rhinosinusitis secondary to edema and inflammation of the nasal lining and production of thick mucus that obstructs the paranasal sinuses and allows a secondary bacterial overgrowth. Allergic rhinitis can lead to sinusitis also due to ostial obstruction. Ciliary immobility can lead to increased mucus viscosity, further blocking drainage. Bacteria are introduced into the sinuses by coughing and nose blowing. Bacterial sinusitis usually occurs after a viral upper respiratory infection and worsening symptoms after 5 days, or persistent symptoms after 10 days. A key concept in understanding the pathogenesis of acute bacterial sinusitis is that the nasal and nasopharyngeal mucosae are continuous with the paranasal sinus mucosa. Any process that affects the nasal mucosa may also affect the sinus mucosa; The mucosa consists of mucus secreting goblet cells and pseudo-stratified ciliated columnar epithelium. The role of the mucus covering the mucosa is to catch the dust, stimulating particles and microorganisms. The drainage of mucus is by active mucociliary transport, and not by gravity. Nasal secretions originate from goblet cells, epithelial cells, epithelial cell proteins, vascular transudation and lacrimal fluid. The essential protein parts of these secretions are mucin glycoproteins composed of oligosaccharide side chains and a peptide core structure. Those glycoproteins affect the composition of the mucus and facilitate the interaction between microorganisms and host. Mucin binds surface adhesins on microorganisms therefore inhibiting their ability to colonize the epithelium. Mucociliary movement transports mucus from the paranasal sinuses to the nasal cavity and pharynx where it is swallowed. The large nasal mucosal surface consists of a mucus layer that moistens the air flowing over it and filters the air particles. In the nasal submucosa, vascular plexi swell and produce nasal congestion after exposure to certain stimuli such as noxious or allergic triggers, and temperature changes.\n\n# Causes\nThe most common causes of  include conditions that interferes with normal sinus drainage predisposes to the development of infection.\n- Obstruction of the sinus outflow tract may be due to mucosal swelling (allergic rhinitis, viral URI)\n- Mechanical obstruction (nasal polyp, foreign body, tumor, anatomic abnormality).\n- Instrumentation (with nasotracheal, nasogastric, orotracheal, or orogastric tubes) is an essential risk factor for ABRS.\n\n# Differentiating  from other Diseases\n- Differential diagnosis include\n- Adenoid hypertrophy\n- Adenoiditis\n- Benign tumors of the nasal cavity\n- Benign tumors of the sinuses\n- Ciliary dyskinesia\n- Congenital malformations of the sinuses\n- Immune deficiency\n- Upper respiratory infection\nFor further information about the differential diagnosis, click here.\n\n# Epidemiology and Demographics\n\n## Frequency\n- Although the exact incidence of sinusitis in the pediatric population in united states is unclear, it is diagnosed commonly, most often following a viral URTI. The number of URTIs that an individual has per year may be as high as 25 (children will have on average 6-8 per year); the number depends on a several factors, including age, day care attendance, and number of siblings\n\n## Age\n- Patients of all age groups may develop .\n-  is more commonly observed among children younger than 15 years of age and adults aged  years.\n\n## Gender\n- There is no sex predilection for .\n\n## Race\n- There is no racial predilection for .\n\n# Risk Factors\n- Local predisposing factors\n- Allergic rhinitis\n- URI\n- Anatomic abnormality\nDeviated septum\nConcha bullosa\nEnlarged adenoid\n- Deviated septum\n- Concha bullosa\n- Enlarged adenoid\n- Nasal polyps\n- Tumor\n- Foreign body\n- Trauma\n- Barotrauma\n- Diving, swimming\n- Smoke\n- Topical decongestant abuse\n- Nasal intubation, Nasogastric tube\n- Systemic predisposing factors\n- Immune deficiency\nIgA deficiency\nPan-hypogammaglobulinemia\nIgG subclass deficiency\nHIV\n- IgA deficiency\n- Pan-hypogammaglobulinemia\n- IgG subclass deficiency\n- HIV\n- Cystic fibrosis\n- Ciliary disorder\n\n# Natural History, Complications and Prognosis\n- Early clinical features include  and \n- If left untreated, many patients with  may progress to develop .\n- Common complications of  include\n- Orbit (optic neuritis, orbital and periorbital cellulitis, Orbital and subperiosteal abscess)\n- Central nervous system (meningitis, subdural and epidural empyema, brain abscess and venous sinus thrombosis)\n- Bone (maxillary osteitis, frontal osteitis (Pott puffy tumor))\n\n# Diagnosis\n\n## Diagnostic Criteria\n- The IDSA guidelines suggest that ABRS can be diagnosed with each of the following clinical scenarios:\n- URI symptoms lasting more than 10 days without any improvement;\n- Severe onset of signs and symptoms lasting more than 3-4 consecutive days, like high grade fever (>39°C),facial pain or purulent nasal discharge;\n- Worsening of signs and symptoms following a typical viral URI that lasted 5-6 days and were initially improving, like new onset of fever, headache, or increase in nasal discharge “double-sickening”.\n\n## Symptoms\n- Symptoms of  may include the following:\n- Common symptoms include:\nDaytime cough and rhinorrhea\nNasal congestion\nInfrequent low-grade fever\nOtitis media (50-60% of patients)\nIrritability\nHeadache\n- Daytime cough and rhinorrhea\n- Nasal congestion\n- Infrequent low-grade fever\n- Otitis media (50-60% of patients)\n- Irritability\n- Headache\n- Signs and symptoms of severe infection include:\nPurulent rhinorrhea\nHigh fever (ie, >39°C)\nPeriorbital edema\n- Purulent rhinorrhea\n- High fever (ie, >39°C)\n- Periorbital edema\n\n## Physical Examination\n- Physical examination may be remarkable for:\n- Anterior rhinoscopy\nExamine the middle turbinate and middle meatus for evidence of purulence or sinus discharge.\nPolyps, if present, should prompt an evaluation for cystic fibrosis.\n- Examine the middle turbinate and middle meatus for evidence of purulence or sinus discharge.\n- Polyps, if present, should prompt an evaluation for cystic fibrosis.\n- Nasal endoscopy\n- Provides an excellent look at the middle meatus with accurate examination results outside the operating room.\n\n## Laboratory Findings\n- There are no specific laboratory findings associated with  that can help in making the diagnosis. However, they can be essential in determining whether associated conditions such as allergic rhinitis, cystic fibrosis, or immunodeficiency are present. In addition, in patients with suppurative complications or in very sick children, some blood work and cultures may be helpful for determining treatment.\n\n## X-ray\n- An x-ray may not be helpful in the diagnosis of  as 75% of them are either underestimate or overestimate the disease. Inaccuracies are compounded by mucosal tears, asymmetric facial or sinus development, overlying soft tissue, multiple septal walls, sinus overlap, improper exposure, and head rotation.\n\n## Ultrasonography\n- There are no ultrasound findings associated with . However, an ultrasound  may be helpful in the diagnosis of , but results have been somewhat inconsistent.\n\n## CT scan\n-  CT scan is helpful in the diagnosis of . It helps detect mucosal inflammation and anatomic abnormalities in the paranasal sinuses. CT scanning provides a reliable picture of the ostiomeatal complex in a noninvasive fashion.\n- CT scanning demonstrates exceptional diagnostic accuracy for the diagnosis of pediatric sinusitis with excellent sensitivity and specificity.\n- Findings on CT scan suggestive of/diagnostic of  include , .\n- CT scanning is mandatory before endoscopic sinus surgery and very valuable when an impending complication of sinusitis such as periorbital or intracranial involvement exists.\n- Note anatomic abnormalities, hypoplastic maxillary sinuses, concha bullosa, and changes consistent with cystic fibrosis (eg, medial displacement of the lateral nasal wall) on review of CT scans.\n- A thinning of the surrounding bone with wispy areas of calcium density may be observed in patients with allergic fungal sinusitis.\n\n## MRI\n- MRI may be helpful in the diagnosis of complications of  like , \n\n# Treatment\n\n## Medical Therapy\n- An acute attack of rhinosinusitis is usually self-limiting and recovers with symptomatic treatment and with minimal intervention. Steam inhalation, adequate hydration, instillation of topical decongestants, warm facial packs application, and saline nasal drops are useful. Nasal steroidal or cromolyn drops or sprays improve symptoms in children with concurrent nasal allergy. Environmental pollutants worsen the situation, and hence avoidance of them tends to improve rhinosinusitis. Antibiotics are usually not warranted. A “wait-and-watch” policy for 7–10 days is fruitful and cost-effective. About 90% recover without antibiotics in a week. \n- Antibiotics\n- Antibiotics are reserved for children with severe acute sinusitis, Persistent acute sinusitis, Toxic child with suspected complications or persistence of symptoms. Choice of antibiotics should be guided by local susceptibility studies, safety profile, and child's age. Usual preferred are amoxicillin, coamoxiclav, oral cephalosporins, and macrolide group of antibiotics. Treat for 10-14 days or for 1 week beyond symptom resolution. 2 weeks course is usually required. Associated conditions should be simultaneously and individually addressed as follows.\n- Irrigation\n- Saline sinus irrigation has demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of acute and chronic sinusitis as It increases mucociliary flow rates and aids in vasoconstriction. It mechanically clears secretions, decreases bacterial counts, and clears allergens and environmental irritants from the nose.\n- Steroids\n- Nasal steroids are essential for patients with concurrent allergic rhinitis. Of patients with allergic rhinitis, 90% report improvement in symptoms, including nasal congestion. Short bursts of systemic steroids can be helpful for patients with allergies. Many otolaryngologists also give patients with nasal polyposis a short burst before surgical intervention to decrease intraoperative blood loss.\n- Decongestants and antihistamines\n- Nasal decongestants are variably effective. Topical decongestants may improve patients' level of comfort. Restricting use to the first 4-5 days of medical treatment is best in order to avoid rebound vasodilatation.\n- Mucolytics are variably effective. No controlled studies have demonstrated efficacy. Antihistamines are most useful in patients with atopy.\n- Immunotherapy\n- Immunotherapy is effective for patients with known specific allergies who have symptoms not responsive to other forms of traditional medical therapy.\n- Optimization of associated medical conditions\n- Allergic rhinitis - Measures include allergen avoidance, optimal environment, nasal steroids, a second-generation antihistamine, and possible immunotherapy.\n- Gastroesophageal reflux - Treat in consultation with a pediatrician or GI specialist. Conservative measures include elevating the head of the bed, not feeding immediately before bedtime, and thickening feeds. Medical therapy includes H-2 blockers, prokinetic agents, and hydrogen ion pump inhibitors.\n- Immune deficiency - Treat in consultation with an immunologist and possibly an infectious-disease specialist. Treatment involves aggressive routine medical therapy and possibly intravenous gamma-globulin injections. This is an expensive type of therapy with many possible associated complications.\n- Asthma - Measures include avoidance of exacerbating factors and use of bronchodilators and inhaled steroids.\n- Cystic fibrosis - Aggressive nasal toilet with saline irrigations, nasal steroids, and antibiotic irrigations for pseudomonad colonization may help optimize this condition, although antibiotic irrigations have never been prospectively studied effectively.\n- Immotile cilia syndromes - Mechanical clearance of secretions with daily irrigations is helpful in reducing the number of infections.\n- Chronic sinusitis - For patients with chronic rhinosinusitis, administer at least 4 weeks of a broad-spectrum beta-lactamase–resistant second-line antibiotic therapy. Consider changing antibiotics if no significant response has occurred within 1 week. A culture may be required at that point to more appropriately adjust antibiotic coverage.\n- All of the above medical adjuncts may play a role, especially nasal steroids and saline irrigations. Excluding or maximally treating all associated conditions is essential\n\n## Surgery\n- When appropriate, maximal medical therapy fails or with associated anatomic aberrations, surgical interventions are contemplated in rhinosinusitis.\n- Adenoidectomy\n is usually the first surgical intervention considered for children with CRS. A significant symptom overlap exists between adenoiditis and chronic sinusitis. The adenoids are niduses for infection and sources of obstruction. With adenoidectomy alone, symptom improvement occurs for more than 50% of patients.\n-  is usually the first surgical intervention considered for children with CRS. A significant symptom overlap exists between adenoiditis and chronic sinusitis. The adenoids are niduses for infection and sources of obstruction. With adenoidectomy alone, symptom improvement occurs for more than 50% of patients.\n- Functional endoscopic sinus surgery\nConsider surgery as a last resort in the pediatric population. Uncinate removal, anterior ethmoidectomy, and maxillary antrostomy are the most common forms of surgery.\n- Consider surgery as a last resort in the pediatric population. Uncinate removal, anterior ethmoidectomy, and maxillary antrostomy are the most common forms of surgery.\n- Balloon sinuplasty\nThis new procedure should be considered prior to endoscopic sinus surgery. It is helpful for children, especially those children with minimal findings on CT scan but with significant symptoms and a failure to respond to continued medical therapy.\n- This new procedure should be considered prior to endoscopic sinus surgery. It is helpful for children, especially those children with minimal findings on CT scan but with significant symptoms and a failure to respond to continued medical therapy.\n\n## Management of complications\n- Intra orbital and intracranial complications are common in chronic sinusitis, and fungal sinusitis with cystic fibrosis and immunodeficient states. Meningitis, abscess, and cavernous sinus thrombosis may occur. Sinusitis may extend to adjacent tissues and cause adenoiditis, serous or purulent otitis media, laryngitis, and dacryocystitis. Osteomyelitis and mucocele formation are also noted. Hospitalization and intravenous antibiotics may be required for treatment of these complications.  Prolonged course of antibiotics for 4–6 weeks may be necessitated in some. Cerebral venous thrombosis needs anticoagulation. Nasal decongestants and steroids and nasal saline irrigation may be required for a longer time in such patients even after cessation of antimicrobial therapy. Pollutants, irritants, and allergens in the environment increase symptoms and avoidance of them is of benefit.\n- Sinusitis involving the orbit is potentially life threatening and has a high risk of rapid visual loss. Manage orbital involvement closely, even in early cases, because visual changes may be permanent. Orbital involvement requires intravenous antibiotics and possible endoscopic or open surgical management by physicians with expertise in treating these patients.\n- Intracranial involvement in sinusitis usually occurs subsequent to direct spread from sphenoid or frontal sinus disease. Subdural and frontal lobe abscesses are most common and meningitis may occur. Administer intravenous antibiotics with good cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) penetration, such as third-generation cephalosporins. Obtain empiric broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotic coverage while awaiting more specific culture and sensitivity results.\n\n## Prognosis\n- Prognosis is excellent for acute rhinosinusitis. Chronic sinusitis can be much more difficult to manage, but with optimal treatment of associated conditions and full medical treatment, high cure rates are probable. Only rarely is surgery required.\n\n## Prevention\n- Effective measures for the primary prevention of  include prevention of risk factors that can help avoid development of rhinosinusitis. These include environmental pollutants including tobacco smoke, repeated colds and upper airway infections, daycare centre attendance, nasal allergies, and anatomical aberrations.\n- Acute attacks of rhinosinusitis should be optimally managed to prevent progress to chronicity. Influenza and pneumococcal vaccines could also lead to fall in upper airway infections and hence rhinosinusitis.\n- Finally good nasal hygiene and use of saline irrigations may be critical for the prevention of exacerbations of acute or chronic sinusitis. Maximize control of associated conditions and warn patients to avoid exposure to environmental irritants such as cigarette smoke.\n\n## Conclusion\n- Rhinosinusitis is an upper airway infection with chronic implications. Prompt management would prevent cases slipping into chronicity with resistant polymicrobial infections. Management of chronic rhinosinusitis is an expensive, long-term affair with high likelihood of complications. Hence prevention and control of rhinosinusitis will assist in decreasing morbidity and lessen the burden on healthcare expenditure. Achieving sinonasal eutrophism and efficient mucociliary transport is the keystone to sinus health and reduction of recurrences.", "source": "wikidoc", "question": "According to authoritative guidelines, outline your approach to diagnosing and managing a child with suspected acute rhinosinusitis—include the clinical diagnostic criteria that distinguish acute bacterial from viral disease, the indications and rationale for a “wait-and-watch” strategy versus immediate antibiotics, your first‑line antibiotic choices and recommended duration, key adjunctive therapies and when to use them, and the clinical triggers that should prompt imaging, specialist referral, or surgical intervention."}

Here the first superintendent Dr (later Sir) William & Mrs Mildred Ellis who were so  much impressed with Moral therapy and humane treatment they saw offered to people suffering  Mental disorders at the  Quaker Asylum in York that they both  imposed these methods on the staff at Hanwell. This was as such the very first large scale experiment.  The second superintendent brought mechanical restraints - as a form of treatment - back. The third superintendent  Dr John Conolly against stiff opposition backed up with much vitriol, took the example further,  and did away with all mechanical restraints.  To the surprise and disbelieve of many he found, like the Ellises before, that bedlam diminished, behaviour became less defensive  and cooperation improved dramatically, and  many recovered or much improved. This event added to his other pioneering work such as developing proper diets and conditions for his patients and battles to set up  regular training  lecture specialising in mental health, for doctor training, all led to him receiving world wide recognition.\nBroadmoor high secure hospital:\nIn order to end the isolation suffered by the high secure services from the rest of the NHS, the Health Act 1999 was passed, allowing NHS Trusts to provide for these. sth After a three month  consultation in the early part of the following year it was agreed that the high secure services based at Broadmoor and those provided by the Ealing, Hammersmith and Fulham Mental Health NHS Trust should be combined into one organisation.

{"guideline_text": "Primary amyloidosis overview\n\n# Overview\nIn 1639, Nicolaus Fontanus autopsied a young man who had ascites, jaundice, liver abscess, and splenomegaly and his report has been the first description of amyloidosis. There is no significant data regarding the historical perspective of amyloidosis throughout the 18th century. Rudolph Virchow and Weber are the prominent figures with substantial work on amyloidosis during the 19th century. In 1922, Bennhold introduced Congo Red staining of amyloid that remains the gold standard for diagnosis. Amyloidosis may be classified on the basis of type of amyloidogenic protein and associated clinical syndromes into primary (AL) amyloidosis, secondary (AA) amyloidosis, familial (AF) amyloidosis, transthyretin (ATTRwt) amyloidosis and dialysis-associated (AH) amyloidosis. It can also be classified based on extent of organ system involvement. Amyloid is an abnormal insoluble extracellular protein that deposits in the different tissues and causes organic dysfunction and a wide variety of clinical syndromes. In primary amyloidosis, amyloid gradually accumulate and amyloid deposition is widespread in the viscera (mainly kidneys, heart and liver), blood vessel walls, and in the different connective tissues. Primary (AL) amyloidosis) is the most common type of amyloidosis. It results from aggregation and deposition of monoclonal immunoglobulin (Ig) light chains that usually produced by plasma cell clones. The cause of AL amyloidosis is usually a plasma cell dyscrasia, an acquired abnormality of the plasma cell in the bone marrow with production of an abnormal light chain protein (a component of an antibody). There are approximately 4000 new cases of AL amyloidosis annually in the United States, though actual incidence may be somewhat higher as a result of under-diagnosis. While the incidence is thought to be equal in males and females, about 60% of patients referred to amyloid centers are male. AL amyloidosis has been reported in individuals as young as 20 years of age but is typically diagnosed at about age 50-65. The most common risk factor for the development of primary amyloidosis is the presence of an underlying plasma cell dyscrasia. In primary amyloidosis, insoluble fibrils of AL amyloid are deposited in organs, causing organ dysfunction and eventually death. Patients with primary amyloidosis may eventually suffer from heart failure, nephrotic syndrome, hepatomegaly and peripheral neuropathy. In primary amyloidosis or AL amyloidosis, the survival rate depends upon the type of organ involvement and the hematological response to treatment. In AL amyloidosis, untreated individuals have the worst prognosis. In this group of patients, the median survival is one to two years. The diagnostic study of choice in primary amyloidosis is tissue biopsy of the affected organ. Congo Red staining will show apple green birefringence of the tissue sample under polarized light, and subtyping of light chains (for light chain amyloidosis) can be done via mass spectrometry. Bone marrow biopsy and organ-specific laboratory measurements are also important ancillary tests. Symptoms can be quite diverse and range from dyspnea, lethargy, weight loss, fevers/chills to anasarca, bleeding tendency, frothy urine, numbness/tingling and diarrhea/constipation. Common findings in primary amyloidosis include petechiae, ecchymosis, parotid gland enlargement, increased intraocular pressure, enlarged tongue, hepatomegaly, carpal tunnel syndrome, and Raynaud's phenomenon. Laboratory findings in amyloidosis include elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, increased BUN level, serum creatinine, protein, casts, or fat bodies in urine. Serum troponin, B-type natriuretic peptide, and beta-2-microglobulin are prognostic markers for heart failure. Amyloid deposits can be identified histologically by Congo red staining and viewing under polarized light where amyloid deposits produce a distinctive 'apple green birefringence'. Alternatively, thioflavin T stain may be used. An abdominal fat pad aspiration, rectal mucosa biopsy, or bone marrow biopsy can help confirm the diagnosis. They reveal positive findings in 80% patients.  Findings on electrocardiogram include low voltage QRS complexes, left and right ventricular hypertrophy, left atrial abnormalities, pathological Q waves, and AV block. Echocardiography is critical in the diagnosis of cardiac involvement in primary amyloidosis. Echocardiogram should be done at diagnosis and routinely thereafter to monitor response to therapy. Chest x-ray findings in a case of amyloidosis include a coin lesion. CT scan can be done to assess for amyloid deposition in particular organs. It can also be done to rule out other causes of organ dysfunction. However, MRI is more sensitive than CT in the diagnosis of amyloidosis. Tissue doppler echocardiography and myocardial strain rate imaging has been shown to be very sensitive for the assessment of myocardial dysfunction in restrictive cardiomyopathy. The development of serum amyloid P component (SAP) scans has given physicians the ability to specifically locate amyloid deposits. Patients with systemic AL amyloidosis are not cured with conventional immunosuppressant treatment. However, early mortality rates have decreased and survival has improved as there has been a shift toward earlier diagnosis and therapy aimed at achieving remissions. The most commonly used regimen for AL amyloidosis is CyBorD, which consists of cyclophosphamide, bortezomib, and dexamethasone. Organ-specific transplant may need to be done, depending on the organ involved. However, surgery is not commonly done in patients with amyloidosis, since it is usually a systemic disease that requires treatment of the underlying cause.\n\n# Historical Perspective\nIn 1639, Nicolaus Fontanus autopsied a young man who had ascites, jaundice, liver abscess, and splenomegaly and his report has been the first description of amyloidosis.

In primary amyloidosis, amyloid gradually accumulate and amyloid deposition is widespread in the viscera (mainly kidneys, heart and liver), blood vessel walls, and in the different connective tissues. Primary (AL) amyloidosis) is the most common type of amyloidosis. It results from aggregation and deposition of monoclonal immunoglobulin (Ig) light chains that usually produced by plasma cell clones.\n\n# Causes\nThe cause of AL amyloidosis is usually a plasma cell dyscrasia, an acquired abnormality of the plasma cell in the bone marrow with production of an abnormal light chain protein (a component of an antibody).\n\n# Differentiating Primary Amyloidosis From Other Diseases\nPrimary amyloidosis may affect any organ in the body but the most commonly affected organs are the heart, kidneys and nerves. Involvement of these organ systems may give rise to organ failure, therefore early diagnosis is imperative for optimal treatment. Organ specific amyloidosis should be differentiated from other diseases that mimic amyloidosis and may present as organ dysfunction, specifically, nephrotic syndrome leading to renal failure, cardiac failure and polyneuropathy.\n\n# Epidemiology and Demographics\nThere are approximately 4000 new cases of AL amyloidosis annually in the United States, though actual incidence may be somewhat higher as a result of under-diagnosis. While the incidence is thought to be equal in males and females, about 60% of patients referred to amyloid centers are male. AL amyloidosis has been reported in individuals as young as 20 years of age but is typically diagnosed at about age 50-65.\n\n# Risk Factors\nThe most common risk factor for the development of primary amyloidosis is the presence of an underlying plasma cell dyscrasia.\n\n# Screening\nThere is insufficient evidence to recommend routine screening for primary amyloidosis.\n\n# Natural History, Complications, and Prognosis\nIn primary amyloidosis, insoluble fibrils of AL amyloid are deposited in organs, causing organ dysfunction and eventually death. Patients with primary amyloidosis may eventually suffer from heart failure, nephrotic syndrome, hepatomegaly and peripheral neuropathy. In primary amyloidosis or AL amyloidosis, the survival rate depends upon the type of organ involvement and the hematological response to treatment. In AL amyloidosis, untreated individuals have the worst prognosis. In this group of patients, the median survival is one to two years.\n\n# Diagnosis\n\n## Diagnostic Study of Choice\nThe diagnostic study of choice in primary amyloidosis is tissue biopsy of the affected organ. Congo Red staining will show apple green birefringence of the tissue sample under polarized light, and subtyping of light chains (for light chain amyloidosis) can be done via mass spectrometry. Bone marrow biopsy and organ-specific laboratory measurements are also important ancillary tests.\n\n## History and Symptoms\nIn primary amyloidosis, the range of symptoms depends on specific tissues and organs involved. Symptoms can be quite diverse and range from dyspnea, lethargy, weight loss, fevers/chills to anasarca, bleeding tendency, frothy urine, numbness/tingling and diarrhea/constipation.\n\n## Physical Examination\nCommon findings in primary amyloidosis include petechiae, ecchymosis, parotid gland enlargement, increased intraocular pressure, enlarged tongue, hepatomegaly, carpal tunnel syndrome, and Raynaud's phenomenon.\n\n## Laboratory Findings\nLaboratory findings in amyloidosis include elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, increased BUN level, serum creatinine, protein, casts, or fat bodies in urine. Serum troponin, B-type natriuretic peptide, and beta-2-microglobulin are prognostic markers for heart failure. Amyloid deposits can be identified histologically by Congo red staining and viewing under polarized light where amyloid deposits produce a distinctive 'apple green birefringence'. Alternatively, thioflavin T stain may be used. An abdominal fat pad aspiration, rectal mucosa biopsy, or bone marrow biopsy can help confirm the diagnosis. They reveal positive findings in 80% patients.\n\n## Electrocardiogram\nElectrocardiogram is particularly useful for cardiac involvement in primary amyloidosis. Findings on electrocardiogram include low voltage QRS complexes, left and right ventricular hypertrophy, left atrial abnormalities, pathological Q waves, and AV block.\n\n## X-ray\nChest x-ray findings in a case of amyloidosis include a coin lesion.\n\n## Echocardiography and Ultrasound\nEchocardiography is critical in the diagnosis of cardiac involvement in primary amyloidosis. Echocardiogram should be done at diagnosis and routinely thereafter to monitor response to therapy.\n\n## CT scan\nCT scan can be done to assess for amyloid deposition in particular organs. It can also be done to rule out other causes of organ dysfunction. However, MRI is more sensitive than CT in the diagnosis of amyloidosis.\n\n## MRI\nMRI is commonly done to assess for amyloid deposition in particular organs. It can also be done to rule out other causes of organ dysfunction. However, MRI is more sensitive than CT in the diagnosis of amyloidosis. A cardiac MRI is used when an echocardiogram fails to differentiate amyloidosis from hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.\n\n## Other Imaging Findings\nTissue doppler echocardiography and myocardial strain rate imaging has been shown to be very sensitive for the assessment of myocardial dysfunction in restrictive cardiomyopathy. The development of serum amyloid P component (SAP) scans has given physicians the ability to specifically locate amyloid deposits.\n\n## Other Diagnostic Studies\nA tissue biopsy or fat aspirate should be done to confirm the presence or type of amyloid protein which is involved in the pathogenesis of the disease.\n\n# Treatment\n\n## Medical Therapy\nPatients with systemic AL amyloidosis are not cured with conventional immunosuppressant treatment. However, early mortality rates have decreased and survival has improved as there has been a shift toward earlier diagnosis and therapy aimed at achieving remissions. The most commonly used regimen for AL amyloidosis is CyBorD, which consists of cyclophosphamide, bortezomib, and dexamethasone.\n\n## Surgery\nOrgan-specific transplant may need to be done, depending on the organ involved. However, surgery is not commonly done in patients with amyloidosis, since it is usually a systemic disease that requires treatment of the underlying cause.\n\n## Primary Prevention\nThere is no role for primary prevention in amyloidosis.\n\n## Secondary Prevention\nThere is no role for secondary prevention in amyloidosis.", "source": "wikidoc", "question": "According to authoritative guidelines, outline a structured diagnostic and initial management approach to a patient with suspected primary (AL) amyloidosis, detailing which tissue(s) should be sampled and why, the role and interpretation of Congo red staining and light‑chain subtyping, the key laboratory and imaging investigations (including their prognostic value), and how the diagnostic findings should inform choice of initial therapy (including indications for CyBorD and consideration of organ‑specific transplantation)."}

{"guideline_text": "Twelve Tips for Better Communication with Patients During History-Taking\n\nEliciting proper history from a patient is of paramount importance to establish an accurate diagnosis and management in medical practice. Good communication skill is a prerequisite for an effective physician patient relationship. A systematic search of medical literature has been made to formulate a guideline for better communication during history taking. The guideline emphasizes on both physical environment and emotional encounter and the key points are expressed as tips on relevant issues.\n\n# Introduction\nThe history obtained from a patient is usually of paramount importance in medicine and to elicit a proper history, adequate communication skills are necessary [bib_ref] An experimental comparison of three courses in history-taking skills for medical students, Maguire [/bib_ref] [bib_ref] Reliability and feasibility of measuring medical interviewing skills: the revised Maastricht History..., Thiel [/bib_ref]. The accuracy of diagnoses and the establishment of therapeutic physician-patient relationships depend on effective communication skills within the medical interview [bib_ref] Teaching Medical Interviewing: A Basic Course on Interviewing and the Physician Patient..., Novack [/bib_ref]. However, this is the very aspect of physicians' professional skills that is still the most common cause of complaint from patients or their relatives, which can be seen as an apparent weak point in physicians' professional competence.\n\n# Methods\nA systemic search for medical literature was performed using computerized databases including Medline to find out the ways for better communication between physician and patient. The search parameters were revised several times by adding or deleting key words to assure a complete review. In addition, the citations of articles identified through computer searches were examined. Moreover, experts were also contacted to identify other work that may have missed. The results of review were formulated into twelve tips for better communication.\n\n## Beginning of a history taking session\nThe patient's impression of the physician is generally formed within minutes of commencing the interaction and this is the stage where rapport is established between physician and patient, which helps the patient to open up.\nTip 1: Make sure that your beginning is smooth. All you need to do is -greet the patient, check the identity of the patient, introduce yourself, offer some personal but interesting and relevant chit chat, and finally do not forget to explain the purpose of the interview.\n\n## Seating and body posture\nCommunication can be helped or hindered by the physical setting where the interview is conducted. Normally, patient and physician should be comfortably seated at the same level so that the eyes of the physician are on level with the patient. In hospitals this can be easily achieved by sitting down on a chair beside the patient's bed. Sitting down sends some important signals to the patient-that the physician is there to listen, that he/she is under the control of the patient and that he/she would like to engage in non-patronizing communication. Furthermore, when the physician sits down, the patient perceives the length of time spent at the bedside as longer than if the physician remained standing.\nTo avoid direct face to face confrontation the seating arrangement should be set at an angle to each other, rather than directly opposite [bib_ref] Studies in Personal Space, Sommer [/bib_ref]. An ideal distance between the patient and the physician would be around one meter, reflecting something between intimate and casual or personal distance, however, this distance seems to vary from culture to culture. The arrangement should be close enough to convey confidentiality, but not so close as to intrude upon each other's personal space.\nWhen seated, a forward leaning posture by the physician has been found to be associated with higher patient satisfaction [bib_ref] Assessment of nonverbal communication in the patient physician interview, Larsen [/bib_ref]. An open posture with hands and legs uncrossed tends to be interpreted as a signal of warmth, acceptance and willingness to participateand is the most facilitative posture.\n\n## Eye contact\nEye contact is very important since it is usually a pre-requisite for any conversational interaction. Frequent but not constant eye contract facilitates communication. It conveys a willingness to participate with another person. Constant eye contract is experienced as aggressive or erotic. No eye contact may convey embarrassment, disinterest or deception. When dealing with patients, it is important to display appropriate levels of eye contact, since too much or too little can be disconcerting.\n\n## Listening\nOne of the common misdemeanors is that the physician does not let the patient talk. Detailed studies of physician interviews with patients revealed that patients usually attended physicians with between 1.2-3.9 major complaints. However, the time that the patient was allowed to talk before being interrupted by the physician was eighteen seconds and they only ever finish their opening statements in 23% of cases .\nEffective listening does improve patient satisfaction [bib_ref] Physicians' Behaviour that Correlate with Patient Satisfaction, Comstock [/bib_ref] particularly if they are allowed to tell their own story in their own words and express their feelings [bib_ref] Interaction Exchange Structure and Patient Satisfaction with medical Interviews, Stiles [/bib_ref] [bib_ref] Factors Affecting Patient's Compliance with Doctors Advice, Stewart [/bib_ref]. During interpersonal encounters, the practitioner must make the effort not only to listen to others, but also to clearly demonstrate, both verbally and nonverbally, that he is indeed doing so. This type of active listening is also required to ensure that maximum verbal and nonverbal information is received from patients.\nPhysicians often fail to keep to relevant matters by using proper reinforcement, reflection and interrupting when the patient is \"off-the -track\". However, the patient should only be interrupted when absolutely necessary.\n\n## Use of facilitation\nProviding proper facilitation on the part of the physician is essential for effective communication to occur. Facilitation can be provided in both non-verbal and verbal ways. Non-verbal ways include -smiling, nodding, and showing an unhurried manner, using appropriate body language and also appropriate touching of the patient. The verbal types of facilitation are-reflection i.e. the physician encourages the patient to continue speaking by repeating, and so reflecting back to him, a phrase, idea or significant word from what the patient has just said by which the patient is prompted to express himself further. The reinforcement is used in interviewing to encourage the involvement of the other person, to demonstrate interest, to develop and maintain relationships, to provide reassurance to convey warmth and friendliness and to help to control the topic of conversation. There are wide ranges of verbal and nonverbal behaviors, which are employed in order to reinforce others.\n\n## Tip 5: use of frequent facilitation to encourage the patient to talk and to stay involved in the conversation.\n\n## Silence\nSilence can occur during history taking, when the patient runs out of words or is unsure about expressing his/her feelings. In this situation, the physician must resist the temptation to fill the silence instantly with a new question on a new topic. A silence usually means that the patient is thinking or feeling something important, not that he or she has stopped thinking. So the patient should be given a little time with an expression of unhurried interest and concern.\n\n## Tip 6: \"silence is golden\"-so tolerate short silences. the patient may be doing important 'work'.\n\n## Psychosocial and personal issues\nPsychological and social factors have obvious impacts on patients' illness states [bib_ref] Effects of communication skills training on students' diagnosis efficiency, Evans [/bib_ref]. However, many physicians begin to focus on patient symptoms and restrict themselves to functional enquiries. They are reluctant to ask about relevant psychological and social aspects of their histories. As a result they receive very little information about psychological and social factors, which are so important in-patient care [bib_ref] An experimental comparison of three courses in history-taking skills for medical students, Maguire [/bib_ref] [bib_ref] Effects of communication skills training on students' diagnosis efficiency, Evans [/bib_ref] [bib_ref] Interviewing skills of first year medical students, Preven [/bib_ref].\nEliciting sensitive and personal information is central to the performance of effective and complete care. Yet it is taxing to both physician and patient. However, the patient and physician must both overcome prior conditioning that personal and sensitive information is not welcomed or considered relevant by physicians. The fact that painful personal material taxes the sick person is often true, but it is also often helpful or necessary. Physicians sometimes rationale that patients should not be subjected to invasive inquiry in order to avoid discomfort. Yet patients welcome such discussion more often than not.\nTo elicit sensitive and personal information, the most effective way to begin demonstrating to the patient that personal feelings and experience are of importance in the process of care is to take the first opportunity to inquiry about them. After doing this several times, the patient will realize that the physician wants to know and understand more than a narrow account of disease.\nTip 7: Attempt to include relevant psychosocial issues in the discussion and show your willingness to discuss emotional and highly personal issues raised by the patient.\n\n## Empathy and warmth\nEmpathic responses do not signify that the physician would probably, if placed in similar circumstance, have similar feelings. But the physician is indicating that he shares them to the extent that he recognizes and understands them, and hinting that he would probably, if placed in similar circumstance have similar feelings. However, physicians often exhibit a low level of empathy, when interviewing patients [bib_ref] Simulated patients and the assessment of medical students' interpersonal skills, Sanson-Fisher [/bib_ref]. Sometimes this leads to a complete breakdown in communication, since patients become so preoccupied with their own unexpressed worries that they stop paying attention to the physician.\nPatient satisfaction and compliance with treatment are positively related to perceptions of practitioners as being warm and friendly [bib_ref] Motivations as predictors of health behaviour, Becker [/bib_ref] [bib_ref] Patients satisfaction and reported acceptance of advice in general practice, Kincey [/bib_ref]. Thus it is important for practitioners to demonstrate a warm, friendly approach when dealing with patients. Physicians or medical students express warmth, when they accept the patient as a person [bib_ref] Measuring Medical Students' Communication Skills: Development and Evaluation of an Interview Rating..., Evans [/bib_ref].\n\n## Verbal and non-verbal leads\nPatients frequently open the discussion with a presenting problem and will often reveal their real problems, when encouraged to do so. It is therefore important to be aware of verbal and non-verbal signals, which patients may emit to indicate a desire for a deeper level of discussion. One criterion of skilled communication is the ability to recognize and act on non-verbal changes in the patient. In addition to this there are skills associated with the transmission of appropriate non-verbal signals to the patient. These can indicate interest, concern and empathy and be of great value in facilitating communication.\n\n## Question style\nTo elicit a proper history an appropriate use of questions is necessary. \"Funneling\" can be used, which refers to the use of questions to guide the conversation from the general to the specific i.e. the questioner uses open questioning initially and proceeds to probing questions and then closed questions.\n\n## Use of jargon\nPhysicians are constantly tempted to use medical jargon, when they speak to patients. Most often for the patient, jargon is an unintelligible language. Studies showed that jargon confused and alienated the patients, often leading to misunderstanding [bib_ref] The Mystification of Meaning: Doctor-Patient Encounters, Barnlund [/bib_ref] and misinterpretation [bib_ref] Communication and the Family Physician, Wilson [/bib_ref].\nTip 11: Avoid using jargon; use simple everyday language.\n\n## Conclusion of the interview\nIn relation to physician-patient communication it is expected that 'bringing the consultation to an end should be a progressive, step by step process through which physician and patient will co-operate and coordinate their actions. However, in the actual setting it is commonly observed that ending the interview is rushed over in order to get on to the next patient or activity.\n[fig] Tip 2: Plan a facilitative seating arrangement and maintain forward leaning open posture. [/fig]\n[fig] Tip 3: Display appropriate level of eye contact; do not over use or under use. [/fig]\n[fig] Tip 4: Interrupt less frequently, listen carefully and keep the patient to relevant matters. [/fig]\n[fig] Tip 8: Show your empathy and be warm and friendly by considering the patient as person, not just a clinical problem. [/fig]\n[fig] Tip 10: Start with open ended questions and proceeds to probe questions and then closed questions. [/fig]\n[fig] Tip 12: Do not show hurried mannerisms; provide a summary of the interview; ask the patient if any thing else is troubling him/her; invite questions from the patient; give a clear indication of the closure of the interview and finally reinforce the patient by providing appropriate remarks at the end of the interactions. [/fig]\n[table] Tip 9: Pick up leads from what the patient says or does; remember to follow the patient sometimes.

{"guideline_text": "Reinforcement\nIn operant conditioning, reinforcement is an increase in the strength of a response following the change in environment immediately following that response. Response strength can be assessed by measures such as the frequency with which the response is made (for example, a pigeon may peck a key more times in the session), or the speed with which it is made (for example, a rat may run a maze faster). The environment change contingent upon the response is called a reinforcer.  Reinforcement can only be confirmed retrospectively, as objects, items, food or other potential 'reinforcers' can only be called such by demonstrating increases in behavior after their administration. It is the strength of the response that is reinforced, not the organism.\n\n# Types of reinforcement\nB.F. Skinner, the researcher who articulated the major theoretical constructs of reinforcement and behaviorism, refused to specify causal origins of reinforcers.  Skinner argued that reinforcers are defined by a change in response strength (that is, functionally rather than causally), and that what is a reinforcer to one person may not be to another.  Accordingly, activities, foods or items which are generally considered pleasant or enjoyable may not necessarily be reinforcing; they can only be considered so if the behavior that immediately precedes the potential reinforcer increases in similar future situations.  If a child receives a cookie when he or she asks for one, and the frequency of 'cookie-requesting behavior' increases, the cookie can be seen as reinforcing 'cookie-requesting behavior'.  If however, cookie-requesting behavior does not increase, the cookie cannot be considered reinforcing.  The sole criterion which can determine if an item, activity or food is reinforcing is the change in the probability of a behavior after the administration of a potential reinforcer. Other theories may focus on additional factors such as whether the person expected the strategy to work at some point, but a behavioral theory of reinforcement would focus specifically upon the probability of the behavior.\nThe study of reinforcement has produced an enormous body of reproducible experimental results. Reinforcement is the central concept and procedure in the experimental analysis of behavior and much of quantitative analysis of behavior.\n- Positive reinforcement  is an increase in the future frequency of a behavior due to the addition of a stimulus immediately following a response.  Giving (or adding) food to a dog contingent on its sitting is an example of positive reinforcement (if this results in an increase in the future behavior of the dog sitting).\n- Negative reinforcement is an increase in the future frequency of a behavior when the consequence is the removal of an aversive stimulus.  Turning off (or removing) an annoying song when a child asks their parent is an example of negative reinforcement (if this results in an increase in asking behavior of the child in the future).\nAvoidance conditioning is a form of negative reinforcement that occurs when a behavior prevents an aversive stimulus from starting or being applied.\n- Avoidance conditioning is a form of negative reinforcement that occurs when a behavior prevents an aversive stimulus from starting or being applied.\nSkinner discusses that while it may appear so, Punishment is not the opposite of reinforcement.  Rather, it has some other effects as well as decreasing undesired behavior.\nDistinguishing \"positive\" from \"negative\" can be difficult, and the necessity of the distinction is often debated. For example, in a very warm room, a current of external air serves as positive reinforcement because it is pleasantly cool or negative reinforcement because it removes uncomfortably hot air. Some reinforcement can be simultaneously positive and negative, such as  a drug addict taking drugs for the added euphoria and eliminating withdrawal symptoms. Many behavioral psychologists simply refer to reinforcement or punishment—without polarity—to cover all consequent environmental changes.\n\n## Primary reinforcers\nA primary reinforcer, sometimes called an unconditioned reinforcer, is a stimulus that does not require pairing to function as a reinforcer and most likely has obtained this function through the evolution and its role in species' survival.  Examples of primary reinforcers include sleep, food, air, water, and sex.  Other primary reinforcers, such as certain drugs, may mimic the effects of other primary reinforcers.  While these primary reinforcers are fairly stable through life and across individuals, the reinforcing value of different primary reinforcers varies due to multiple factors (e.g., genetics, experience). Thus, one person may prefer one type of food while another abhors it.  Or one person may eat lots of food while another eats very little.  So even though food is a primary reinforcer for both individuals, the value of food as a reinforcer differs between them.\nOften primary reinforcers shift their reinforcing value temporarily through satiation and deprivation.  Food, for example, may cease to be effective as a reinforcer after a certain amount of it has been consumed (satiation). After a period during which it does not receive any of the primary reinforcer (deprivation), however, the primary reinforcer may once again regain its effectiveness in increasing response strength.\n\n## Secondary reinforcers\nA secondary reinforcer, sometimes called a conditioned reinforcer, is a stimulus or situation that has acquired its function as a reinforcer after pairing with a stimulus which functions as a reinforcer.  This stimulus may be a primary reinforcer or another conditioned reinforcer (such as money). An example of a secondary reinforcer would be the sound from a clicker, as used in clicker training.  The sound of the clicker has been associated with praise or treats, and subsequently, the sound of the clicker may function as a reinforcer.  As with primary reinforcers, an organism can experience satiation and deprivation with secondary reinforcers.\n\n## Other reinforcement terms\n- A generalized reinforcer is a conditioned reinforcer that has obtained the reinforcing function by pairing with many other reinforcers (such as money, a secondary generalized reinforcer).\n- In reinforcer sampling a potentially reinforcing but unfamiliar stimulus is presented to an organism without regard to any prior behavior. The stimulus may then later be used more effectively in reinforcement.\n- Socially mediated reinforcement (direct reinforcement) involves the delivery of reinforcement which requires the behavior of another organism.\n- Premack principle is a special case of reinforcement elaborated by David Premack, which states that a highly preferred activity can be used effectively as a reinforcer for a less preferred activity.\n- Reinforcement hierarchy is a list of actions, rank-ordering the most desirable to least desirable consequences that may serve as a reinforcer. A reinforcement hierarchy can be used to determine the relative frequency and desirability of different activities, and is often employed when applying the Premack principle.\n- Contingent outcomes are more likely to reinforce behavior than non-contingent responses.  Contingent outcomes are those directly linked to a causal behavior, such a light turning on being contingent on flipping a switch.  Note that contingent outcomes are not necessary to demonstrate reinforcement, but perceived contingency may increase learning.\n- Contiguous stimuli are stimuli closely associated by time and space with specific behaviors.  They reduce the amount of time needed to learn a behavior while increasing its resistance to extinction.  Giving a dog a piece of food immediately after sitting is more contiguous with (and therefore more likely to reinforce) the behavior than a several minute delay in food delivery following the behavior.\n- Noncontingent reinforcement refers to response-independent delivery of stimuli identified serve as reinforcers for some behaviors of that organism. However, this typically entails time-based delivery of stimuli identified as maintaining aberrant behavior, which serves to decrease the rate of the target behavior. As no measured behavior is identified as being strengthened, there is controversy surrounding the use of the term noncontingent \"reinforcement\".\n\n# Natural and artificial reinforcement\nIn his 1967 paper, Arbitrary and Natural Reinforcement, Charles Ferster proposed that reinforcement can be classified into events which increase the frequency of an operant as a natural consequence of the behavior itself, and those which are presumed to affect frequency by their requirement of human mediation, such as in a token economy where subjects are \"rewarded\" for certain behavior with an arbitrary token of a negotiable value.  In 1970, Baer and Wolf created a name for the use of natural reinforcers called behavior traps.  A behavior trap is one in which only a simple response is necessary to enter the trap, yet once entered, the trap cannot be resisted in creating general behavior change.  It is the use of a behavioral trap that will increase one's repertoire by exposing a person to the naturally occurring reinforcement of that behavior.  Behavior traps have four characteristics:\n- They are \"baited\" with virtually irresistible reinforcers that \"lure\" the student to the trap\n- Only a low-effort response already in the repertoire is necessary to enter the trap\n- Interrelated contingencies of reinforcement inside the trap motivate the person to acquire, extend, and maintain targeted academic/social skills\n- they can remain effective for long time because the person shows few, if any, satiation effects.\nAs can be seen from the above, artificial reinforcement is created to build or develop skills, and to generalize, it is important that either a behavior trap is introduced to 'capture' the skill and utilize naturally occurring reinforcement to maintain or increase it.  This behavior trap may simply be a social situation that will generally result from a specific behavior once it has met a certain criterion (ex: if you use edible reinforcers to train a person to say hello and smile at people when they meet them, after that skill has been built up, the natural reinforcer of other people smiling, and having more friendly interactions will naturally reinforce the skill and the edibles can be faded).\n\n# Schedules of reinforcement\nWhen an animal's surroundings are controlled, its behavior patterns after reinforcement become predictable, even for very complex behavior patterns. A schedule of reinforcement is the protocol for determining when responses or behaviors will be reinforced, ranging from continuous reinforcement, in which every response is reinforced, and extinction, in which no response is reinforced. Between these extremes is intermittent or partial reinforcement where only some responses are reinforced.\nSpecific variations of intermittent reinforcement reliably induce specific patterns of response, irrespective of the species being investigated (including humans in some conditions).  The orderliness and predictability of behaviour under schedules of reinforcement was evidence for B. F. Skinner's claim that using operant conditioning he could obtain \"control over behaviour\", in a way that rendered the theoretical disputes of contemporary comparative psychology obsolete. The reliability of schedule control supported the idea that a radical behaviourist experimental analysis of behavior could be the foundation for a psychology that did not refer to mental or cognitive processes.  The reliability of schedules also led to the development of Applied Behavior Analysis as a means of controlling or altering behavior.\nMany of the simpler possibilities, and some of the more complex ones, were investigated at great length by Skinner using pigeons, but new schedules continue to be defined and investigated.\n\n## Simple schedules\nSimple schedules have a single rule to determine when a single type of reinforcer is delivered for specific response.\n- Fixed ratio (FR) schedules deliver reinforcement after every nth response\nExample:  FR2 = every second response is reinforced\nLab example: FR5 = rat reinforced with food after each 5 bar-presses in a Skinner box.\nReal-world example: FR10 = Used car dealer gets a $1000 bonus for each 10 cars sold on the lot.\n- Example:  FR2 = every second response is reinforced\n- Lab example: FR5 = rat reinforced with food after each 5 bar-presses in a Skinner box.\n- Real-world example: FR10 = Used car dealer gets a $1000 bonus for each 10 cars sold on the lot.\n- Continuous ratio (CRF) schedules are a special form of a fixed ratio.  In a continuous ratio schedule, reinforcement follows each and every response.\nLab example: each time a rat presses a bar it gets a pellet of food\nReal world example: each time a dog defecates outside its owner gives it a treat\n- Lab example: each time a rat presses a bar it gets a pellet of food\n- Real world example: each time a dog defecates outside its owner gives it a treat\n- Fixed interval (FI) schedules deliver reinforcement for the first response after a fixed length of time since the last reinforcement, while premature responses are not reinforced.\nExample:  FI1\" = reinforcement provided for the first response after 1 second\nLab example: FI15\" = rat is reinforced for the first bar press after 15 seconds passes since the last reinforcement\nReal world example: FI24 hour = calling a radio station is reinforced with a chance to win a prize, but the person can only sign up once per day\n- Example:  FI1\" = reinforcement provided for the first response after 1 second\n- Lab example: FI15\" = rat is reinforced for the first bar press after 15 seconds passes since the last reinforcement\n- Real world example: FI24 hour = calling a radio station is reinforced with a chance to win a prize, but the person can only sign up once per day\n- Variable ratio (VR) schedules deliver reinforcement after a random number of responses (based upon a predetermined average)\nExample:  VR3 = on average, every third response is reinforced\nLab example: VR10 = on average, a rat is reinforced for each 10 bar presses\nReal world example: VR37 = a roulette player betting on specific numbers will win on average one every 37 tries (on a U.S. roulette wheel, this would be VR38)\n- Example:  VR3 = on average, every third response is reinforced\n- Lab example: VR10 = on average, a rat is reinforced for each 10 bar presses\n- Real world example: VR37 = a roulette player betting on specific numbers will win on average one every 37 tries (on a U.S. roulette wheel, this would be VR38)\n- Variable interval (VI) schedules deliver reinforcement for the first response after a random average length of time passes since the last reinforcement\nExample:  VI3\" = reinforcement is provided for the first response after an average of 3 seconds since the last reinforcement.\nLab example: VI10\" = a rat is reinforced for the first bar press after an average of 10 seconds passes since the last reinforcement\nReal world example: a predator can expect to come across a prey on a variable interval schedule\n- Example:  VI3\" = reinforcement is provided for the first response after an average of 3 seconds since the last reinforcement.\n- Lab example: VI10\" = a rat is reinforced for the first bar press after an average of 10 seconds passes since the last reinforcement\n- Real world example: a predator can expect to come across a prey on a variable interval schedule\nOther simple schedules include:\n- Differential reinforcement of incompatible behavior (DRI) is used to reduce a frequent behavior without punishing it by reinforcing an incompatible response.  An example would be reinforcing clapping to reduce nose picking.\n- Differential reinforcement of other behavior (DRO) is used to reduce a frequent behavior by reinforcing any behavior other than the undesired one.  An example would be reinforcing any hand action other than nose picking.\n- Differential reinforcement of low response rate (DRL) is used to encourage low rates of responding.  It is like an interval schedule, except that premature responses reset the time required between behavior.\nLab example: DRL10\" = a rat is reinforced for the first response after 10 seconds, but if the rat responds earlier than 10 seconds there is no reinforcement and the rat has to wait 10 seconds from that premature response without another response before bar pressing will lead to reinforcement.\nReal world example: \"If you ask me for a potato chip no more than once every 10 minutes, I will give it to you. If you ask more often, I will give you none.\"\n- Lab example: DRL10\" = a rat is reinforced for the first response after 10 seconds, but if the rat responds earlier than 10 seconds there is no reinforcement and the rat has to wait 10 seconds from that premature response without another response before bar pressing will lead to reinforcement.\n- Real world example: \"If you ask me for a potato chip no more than once every 10 minutes, I will give it to you. If you ask more often, I will give you none.\"\n- Differential reinforcement of high rate (DRH) is used to increase high rates of responding.  It is like an interval schedule, except that a minimum number of responses are required in the interval in order to receive reinforcement.\nLab example: DRH10\"/15 responses = a rat must press a bar 15 times within a 10 second increment in order to be reinforced\nReal world example: \"If Lance Armstrong is going to win the Tour de France he has to pedal x number of times during the y hour race.\"\n- Lab example: DRH10\"/15 responses = a rat must press a bar 15 times within a 10 second increment in order to be reinforced\n- Real world example: \"If Lance Armstrong is going to win the Tour de France he has to pedal x number of times during the y hour race.\"\n- Fixed Time (FT) provides reinforcement at a fixed time since the last reinforcement, irrespective of whether the subject has responded or not.  In other words, it is a non-contingent schedule\n- Lab example: FT5\":  rat gets food every 5\" regardless of the behavior.\nReal world example: a person gets an annuity check every month regardless of behavior between checks\n- Lab example: FT5\":  rat gets food every 5\" regardless of the behavior.\n- Real world example: a person gets an annuity check every month regardless of behavior between checks\n- Variable Time (VT) provides reinforcement at an average variable time since last reinforcement, regardless of whether the subject has responded or not.\n\n### Effects of different types of simple schedules\n- Ratio schedules produce higher rates of responding than interval schedules, when the rates of reinforcement are otherwise similar.\n- Variable schedules produce higher rates and greater resistance to extinction than most fixed schedules. This is also known as the Partial Reinforcement Extinction Effect (PREE)\n- The variable ratio schedule produces both the highest rate of responding and the greatest resistance to extinction (an example would be the behavior of gamblers at slot machines)\n- Fixed schedules produce 'post-reinforcement pauses' (PRP), where responses will briefly cease immediately following reinforcement, though the pause is a function of the upcoming response requirement rather than the prior reinforcement.\nThe PRP of a fixed interval schedule is frequently followed by an accelerating rate of response which is \"scallop shaped,\" while those of fixed ratio schedules are more angular.\n- The PRP of a fixed interval schedule is frequently followed by an accelerating rate of response which is \"scallop shaped,\" while those of fixed ratio schedules are more angular.\n- Organisms whose schedules of reinforcement are 'thinned' (that is, requiring more responses or a greater wait before reinforcement) may experience 'ratio strain' if thinned too quickly.  This produces behavior similar to that seen during extinction.\n- Partial reinforcement schedules are more resistant to extinction than continuous reinforcement schedules.\nRatio schedules are more resistant than interval schedules and variable schedules more resistant than fixed ones.\n- Ratio schedules are more resistant than interval schedules and variable schedules more resistant than fixed ones.\n\n## Compound schedules\nCompound schedules combine two or more different simple schedules in some way using the same reinforcer for the same behaviour.  There are many possibilities; among those most often used are:\n- Alternative schedules - A type of compound schedule where two or more simple schedules are in effect and which ever simple schedule is completed first results in reinforcement. \n- Conjunctive schedules - A complex schedule of reinforcement where two or more simple schedules are in effect independently of each other and requirements on all of the simple schedules must be met for reinforcement.\n- Multiple schedules - either of two, or more, schedules may occur with a stimulus indicating which is in force.\nExample: FR4 when given a whistle and FI 6 when given a bell ring.\n- Example: FR4 when given a whistle and FI 6 when given a bell ring.\n- Mixed schedules - either of two, or more, schedules may occur with no stimulus indicating which is in force.\nExample: FI6 and then VR 3 without any stimulus warning of the change in schedule.\n- Example: FI6 and then VR 3 without any stimulus warning of the change in schedule.\n- Concurrent schedules - two schedules are simultaneously in force though not necessarily on two different response devices, and reinforcement on those schedules is independent of each other.\n- Interlocking Schedules - A single schedule with two components where progress in one component affects progress in the other component.  An interlocking FR60-FI120, for example, each response subtracts time from the interval component such that each response is \"equal\" to removing two seconds from the FI.\n- Chained schedules - reinforcement occurs after two or more successive schedules have been completed, with a stimulus indicating when one schedule has been completed and the next has started.\nExample: FR10 in a green light when completed it goes to a yellow light to indicate FR 3, after it's completed it goes into red light to indicate VI 6, etc. At the end of the chain, a reinforcer is given.\n- Example: FR10 in a green light when completed it goes to a yellow light to indicate FR 3, after it's completed it goes into red light to indicate VI 6, etc. At the end of the chain, a reinforcer is given.\n- Tandem schedules - reinforcement occurs when two or more successive schedule requirements have been completed, with no stimulus indicating when a schedule has been completed and the next has started.\nExample: VR 10, after it is completed the schedule is changed without warning to FR 10, after that it is changed without warning to FR 16, etc. At the end of the series of schedules, a reinforcer is finally given.\n- Example: VR 10, after it is completed the schedule is changed without warning to FR 10, after that it is changed without warning to FR 16, etc. At the end of the series of schedules, a reinforcer is finally given.\n- Higher order schedules - completion of one schedule is reinforced according to a second schedule; e.g. in FR2 (FI 10 secs), two successive fixed interval schedules would have to be completed before a response is reinforced.\n\n## Superimposed schedules\nSuperimposed schedules of reinforcement is a term in psychology which refers to a structure of rewards where two or more simple schedules of reinforcement operate simultaneously.  The reinforcers can be positive and/or negative.  An example would be a person who comes home after a long day at work.  The behavior of opening the front door is rewarded by a big kiss on lips by the person's spouse and a rip in the pants from the family dog jumping enthusiastically.  Another example of superimposed schedules of reinforcement would be a pigeon in an experimental cage pecking at a button.  The pecks result in a hopper of grain being delivered every twentieth peck and access to water becoming available after every two hundred pecks.\nSuperimposed schedules of reinforcement are a type of compound schedule that evolved from the initial work on simple schedules of reinforcement by B. F. Skinner and his colleagues (Skinner and Ferster, 1957). They demonstrated that reinforcers could be delivered on schedules, and further that organisms behaved differently under different schedules.  Rather than a reinforcer, such as food or water, being delivered every time as a consequence of some behavior, a reinforcer could be delivered after more than one instance of the behavior.  For example, a pigeon may be required to peck a button switch ten times before food is made available to the pigeon.    This is called a \"ratio schedule.\"  Also, a reinforcer could be delivered after an interval of time passed following a target behavior.  An example is a rat that is given a food pellet two minutes after the rat pressed a lever. This is called an \"interval schedule.\"  In addition, ratio schedules can deliver reinforcement following fixed or variable number of behaviors by the individual organism. Likewise, interval schedules can deliver reinforcement following fixed or variable intervals of time following a single response by the organism.  Individual behaviors tend to generate response rates that differ based upon how the reinforcement schedule is created. Much subsequent research in many labs examined the effects on behaviors of scheduling reinforcers. \nIf an organism is offered the opportunity to choose between or among two or more simple schedules of reinforcement at the same time, the reinforcement structure is called a \"concurrent schedule of reinforcement.\"  Brechner (1974, 1977) introduced the concept of \"superimposed schedules of reinforcement in an attempt to create a laboratory analogy of social traps, such as when humans overharvest their fisheries or tear down their rainforests.   Brechner created a situation where simple reinforcement schedules were superimposed upon each other.  In other words, a single response or group of responses by an organism led to multiple consequences. Concurrent schedules of reinforcement can be thought of as \"or\" schedules, and superimposed schedules of reinforcement can be thought of as \"and\" schedules.  Brechner and Linder (1981) and Brechner (1987) expanded the concept to describe how superimposed schedules and the social trap analogy could be used to analyze the way energy flows through systems.\nSuperimposed schedules of reinforcement have many real-world applications in addition to generating social traps.  Many different human individual and social situations can be created by superimposing simple reinforcement schedules. For example a human being could have simultaneous tobacco and alcohol addictions.   Even more complex situations can be created or simulated by superimposing two or more concurrent schedules.  For example,  a high school senior could have a choice between going to Stanford University or UCLA, and at the same time have the choice of going into the Army or the Air Force, and simultaneously the choice of taking a job with an internet company or a job with a software company.  That would be a reinforcement structure of three superimposed concurrent schedules of reinforcement.  Superimposed schedules of reinforcement can be used to create the three classic conflict situations (approach-approach conflict, approach-avoidance conflict, and avoidance-avoidance conflict) described by Kurt Lewin (1935)and can be used to operationalize other Lewinian situations analyzed by his force field analysis. Another example of the use of superimposed schedules of reinforcement as an analytical tool is its application to the contingencies of rent control (Brechner, 2003).\n\n## Concurrent schedules\nIn operant conditioning, concurrent schedules of reinforcement are schedules of reinforcement that are simultaneously available to an animal subject or human participant, so that the subject or participant can respond on either schedule.  For example, a pigeon in a Skinner box might be faced with two pecking keys; pecking responses can be made on either, and food reinforcement might follow a peck on either.  The schedules of reinforcement arranged for pecks on the two keys can be different.  They may be independent, or they may have some links between them so that behaviour on one key affects the likelihood of reinforcement on the other.\nIt is not necessary for the responses on the two schedules to be physically distinct: in an alternative way of arranging concurrent schedules, introduced by Findley in 1958, both schedules are arranged on a single key or other response device, and the subject or participant can respond on a second key in order to change over between the schedules.  In such a \"Findley concurrent\" procedure, a stimulus (e.g. the colour of the main key) is used to signal which schedule is currently in effect.\nConcurrent schedules often induce rapid alternation between the keys.  To prevent this, a \"changeover delay\" is commonly introduced: each schedule is inactivated for a brief period after the subject switches to it.\nWhen both the concurrent schedules are variable intervals, a quantitative relationship known as the matching law is found between relative response rates in the two schedules and the relative reinforcement rates they deliver; this was first observed by R. J. Herrnstein in 1961.\n\n# Shaping\nShaping involves reinforcing successive, increasingly accurate approximations of a response desired by a trainer. In training a rat to press a lever, for example, simply turning toward the lever will be reinforced at first. Then, only turning and stepping toward it will be reinforced. As training progresses, the response reinforced becomes progressively more like the desired behavior.\n\n# Chaining\nChaining involves linking discrete behaviors together in a series, such that each result of each behaviour is both the reinforcement (or consequence) for the previous behavior, and the stimuli (or antecedent) for the next behavior.  There are many ways to teach chaining, such as forward chaining (starting from the first behavior in the chain), backwards chaining (starting from the last behavior) and total task chaining (in which the entire behavior is taught from beginning to end, rather than as a series of steps). An example would be opening a locked door.  First the key is inserted, then turned, then the door opened.  Forward chaining would teach the subject first to insert the key.  Once that task is mastered, they are told to insert the key, and taught to turn it.  Once that task is mastered, they are told to perform the first two, then taught to open the door.  Backwards chaining would involve the teacher first inserting and turning the key, and the subject is taught to open the door.  Once that is learned, the teacher inserts the key, and the subject is taught to turn it, then opens the door as the next step.  Finally, the subject is taught to insert the key, and they turn and open the door.  Once the first step is mastered, the entire task has been taught.  Total task chaining would involve teaching the entire task as a single series, prompting through all steps.  Prompts are faded (reduced) at each step as they are mastered.\n\n# Criticisms\nThe standard definition of behavioral reinforcement has been criticized as circular, since it appears to argue that response strength is increased by reinforcement while defining reinforcement as something which increases response strength; that is, the standard definition says only that response strength is increased by things which increase response strength. However, the correct usage of reinforer or reinforcement is that something is a reinforcer because of its effect on behavior, and not the other way around.  It becomes circular if one says that a particular stimulus strengthens behavior because it is a reinforcer, and should not be used to explain why a stimulus is producing that effect on the behavior.\nOther definitions have been proposed, such as F. D. Sheffield's \"consummatory behavior contingent on a response,\" but these are not broadly used in psychology.\n\n# History of the terms\nIn the 1920s Russian physiologist Ivan Pavlov may have been the first to use the word reinforcement with respect to behavior, but (according to Dinsmoor) he used its approximate Russian cognate sparingly, and even then it referred to strengthening an already-learned but weakening response. He did not use it, as it is today, for selecting and strengthening new behavior. Pavlov's introduction of the word extinction (in Russian) approximates today's psychological use.\nIn popular use, positive reinforcement is often used as a synonym for reward, with people (not behavior) thus being \"reinforced,\" but this is contrary to the term's consistent technical usage, as it is a dimension of behavior, and not the person, which is strengthened. Negative reinforcement is often used by laypeople and even social scientists outside psychology as a synonym for punishment. This is contrary to modern technical use, but it was B. F. Skinner who first used it this way in his 1938 book. By 1953, however, he followed others in thus employing the word punishment, and he re-cast negative reinforcement for the removal of aversive stimuli.\nThere are some within the field of behavior analysis who have suggested that the terms \"positive\" and \"negative\" constitute an unnecessary distinction in discussing reinforcement as it is often unclear whether stimuli are being removed or presented. For example, Iwata poses the question: “…is a change in temperature more accurately characterized by the presentation of cold (heat) or the removal of heat (cold)?” (p. 363). Thus, it may be best to conceptualize reinforcement simply as a pre-change condition being replaced by a post-change condition which reinforces the behavior which was followed by the change in stimulus conditions.", "source": "wikidoc", "question": "According to authoritative guidelines on reinforcement, outline how you would design and justify a reinforcement-based intervention for teaching a multi-step social skill (e.g., greeting a peer) in a child with developmental delay, addressing: (a) how you would identify and verify effective reinforcers, (b) which types and schedules of reinforcement you would use initially and as the skill is acquired (including use of shaping, chaining, and thinning schedules), (c) strategies to increase resistance to extinction and promote generalization to natural reinforcers, and (d) how you would manage issues such as satiation, contingency/contiguity, and potential pitfalls (e.g., misidentifying reinforcers or producing ratio strain), with rationale grounded in the guideline."}
{"guideline_text": "Sodium–hydrogen antiporter 3\nSodium–hydrogen antiporter 3 also known as sodium–hydrogen exchanger 3 (NHE3) or solute carrier family 9 member 3 (SLC9A3) is a protein that in humans is encoded by the SLC9A3 gene.\nSLC9A3 is a sodium–hydrogen antiporter.  It is found on the apical side of the epithelial cells of the proximal tubule of the nephron of the kidney, in the apical membrane of enterocytes of the intestine, as well as the basolateral side of both duodenal and pancreatic cells responsible for the release of HCO−3 into the duodenal lumen. It is primarily responsible for maintaining the balance of sodium.  It is also indirectly linked to buffering of blood pH.  The  NHE3 antiporter imports one sodium ion into the cytosol of a tubule cell as it ejects one hydrogen ion from the cell into the lumen of the proximal tubule.  The sodium within the tubule cell may then be retained by the body rather than excreted in the urine.  The NHE3 antiporter indirectly contributes to blood buffering capacity because hydrogen ions that are ejected are the products of the carbonic anhydrase enzyme, which also makes bicarbonate.\n\n# Regulation\nProtein kinase C stimulates NHE3, while protein kinase A inhibits it.\nThere is a specific protein functioning as an NHE3 regulator, Sodium-hydrogen antiporter 3 regulator 1.\n\n## Inhibitors\n- Tenapanor\n\n## Stimulators\n- Insulin stimulates NHE3 and thereby proximal tubule sodium absorption.\n\n# Interactions\nSodium–hydrogen antiporter 3 has been shown to interact with CHP.", "source": "wikidoc", "question": "According to authoritative guidelines, discuss how the localization and transport function of sodium–hydrogen antiporter 3 (NHE3) in kidney and intestine determine the expected effects of pharmacologic inhibition (e.g., tenapanor) or stimulation (e.g., insulin) on sodium balance and systemic acid–base status, and outline the clinical implications for patient management including how regulation by protein kinase A/C and interaction with CHP could modify therapeutic response."}
{"guideline_text": "5-HT2B receptor\n5-Hydroxytryptamine receptor 2B (5-HT2B) also known as serotonin receptor 2B is a protein that in humans is encoded by the HTR2B gene. 5-HT2B is a member of the 5-HT2 receptor family that binds the neurotransmitter serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT).\n\n# Function\nThe 5-HT2 receptors (of which the 5-HT2B receptor is a subtype) mediate many of the central and peripheral physiologic functions of serotonin. Cardiovascular effects include contraction of blood vessels and shape changes in platelets; central nervous system effects include neuronal sensitization to tactile stimuli and mediation of some of the effects of hallucinogenic substituted amphetamines.\nThe 5-HT2B receptor subtype is involved in:\n- CNS: presynaptic inhibition, behavioural effects\n- Vascular: pulmonary vasoconstriction\n- Cardiac: The 5-HT2B receptor regulates cardiac structure and functions as demonstrated by the abnormal cardiac development observed in 5-HT2B receptor null mice. The 5-HT2B receptor stimulation can also lead to pathological proliferation of cardiac valves fibroblasts, which with chronic overstimulation of 5-HT2B can lead to a severe valvulopathy. Moreover, 5-HT2B receptors were recently shown to be overexpressed in human failing heart and antagonists of 5-HT2B receptors were uncovered  to prevent both angiotensin II or beta-adrenergic agonist-induced pathological cardiac hypertrophy in mouse.\n- Serotonin transporter: 5-HT2B receptors regulate serotonin release via the serotonin transporter, and are important both to normal physiological regulation of serotonin levels in blood plasma, and with the abnormal acute serotonin release produced by drugs such as MDMA. Surprisingly however 5-HT2B receptor activation appears to be protective against the development of serotonin syndrome following elevated extracellular serotonin levels, despite its role in modulating serotonin release.\n\n# Clinical significance\n5-HT2B receptors have also been strongly implicated in drug-induced valvular heart disease. In this context, it is generally considered to be an antitarget.\nThe structure of the 5-HT2B receptor was recently solved in complex with the valvulopathogenic drug ergotamine.\n\n# Ligands\nAs of 2009, few highly selective 5-HT2B receptor ligands have been discovered, although numerous potent non-selective compounds are known, particularly agents with concomitant 5-HT2C binding. Research in this area has been limited due to the cardiotoxicity of 5-HT2B agonists, and the lack of clear therapeutic application for 5-HT2B antagonists, but there is still a need for selective ligands for scientific research.\n\n## Agonists\n- BW-723C86: fair functional subtype selectivity; almost full agonist.

{"guideline_text": "Stress management\nStress management encompasses techniques intended to equip a person with effective coping mechanisms for dealing with psychological stress, with stress defined as a person's physiological response to an internal or external stimulus that triggers the fight-or-flight response.  Stress management is effective when a person utilizes strategies to cope with or alter stressful situations.\n\n# Historical foundations\nWalter Cannon and Hans Selye used animal studies to establish the earliest scientific basis for the study of stress.  They measured the physiological responses of animals to external pressures, such as heat and cold, prolonged restraint, and surgical procedures, then extrapolated from these studies to human beings. \nSubsequent studies of stress in humans by Richard Rahe and others established the view that stress is caused by distinct, measureable life stressors, and further, that these life stressors can be ranked by the median degree of stress they produce (leading to the Holmes and Rahe Stress Scale). Thus, stress was traditionally conceptualized to be a result of  external insults beyond the control of those experiencing the stress. More recently, however, it has been argued that external circumstances do not have any intrinsic capacity to produce stress, but instead their effect is mediated by the individual's perceptions, capacities, and understanding.\n\n# Models of stress management\n\n## Transactional model\nRichard Lazarus and Susan Folkman suggested in 1984 that stress can be thought of as resulting from an “imbalance between demands and resources” or as occurring when “pressure exceeds one's perceived ability to cope”. Stress management was developed and premised on the idea that stress is not a direct response to a stressor but rather one's resources and ability to cope mediate the stress response and are amenable to change, thus allowing stress to be controllable.\nIn order to develop an effective stress management programme it is first necessary to identify the factors that are central to a person controlling his/her stress, and to identify the intervention methods which effectively target these factors. Lazarus and Folkman's interpretation of stress focuses on the transaction between people and their external environment (known as the Transactional Model). The model conceptualizes stress as a result of how a stressor is appraised and how a person appraises his/her resources to cope with the stressor. The model breaks the stressor-stress link by proposing that if stressors are perceived as positive or challenging rather than a threat, and if the stressed person is confident that he/she possesses adequate rather than deficient coping strategies, stress may not necessarily follow the presence of a potential stressor. The model proposes that stress can be reduced by helping stressed people change their perceptions of stressors, providing them with strategies to help them cope and improving their confidence in their ability to do so.\n\n## Health realization/innate health model\nThe health realization/innate health model of stress is also founded on the idea that stress does not necessarily follow the presence of a potential stressor.  Instead of focusing on the individual's appraisal of so-called stressors in relation to his or her own coping skills (as the transactional model does), the health realization model focuses on the nature of thought, stating that it is ultimately a person's thought processes that determine the response to potentially stressful external circumstances.  In this model, stress results from appraising oneself and one's circumstances through a mental filter of insecurity and negativity, whereas a feeling of well-being results from approaching the world with a \"quiet mind,\" \"inner wisdom,\" and \"common sense\".\nThis model proposes that helping stressed individuals understand the nature of thought--especially providing them with the ability to recognize when they are in the grip of insecure thinking, disengage from it, and access natural positive feelings--will  reduce their stress.\n\n# Techniques of stress management\nThere are several ways of coping with stress.  Some techniques of time management may help a person to control stress.  In the face of high demands, effective stress management involves learning to set limits and to say \"No\" to some demands that others make.  Techniques of stress management will vary according to the theoretical paradigm adhered to, but may include some of the following:\n- Autogenic training\n- Cognitive therapy\n- Conflict resolution\n- Exercise\n- Meditation\n- Nootropics\n- Relaxation techniques\nFractional relaxation\nProgressive relaxation\nStress balls\n- Fractional relaxation\n- Progressive relaxation\n- Stress balls\n- Sexual intercourse\n- Time management\n- Listening to certain types of relaxing music, particularly:\nNew Age music\nClassical music\n- New Age music\n- Classical music\n\n## Measuring stress\nLevels of stress can be measured. One way is through the use of the Holmes and Rahe Stress Scale to rate stressful life events. Changes in blood pressure and galvanic skin response can also be measured to test stress levels, and changes in stress levels.  A digital thermometer can be used to evaluate changes in skin temperature, which can indicate activation of the fight or flight response drawing blood away from the extremities.\nStress management has physiological and immune benefit effects. \n\n## Effectiveness of Stress Management\nPositive outcomes are observed using a combination of non-drug interventions:\n- treatment of anger or hostility,\n- Autogenic Training\n- talking therapy (around relationship or existential issues)\n- biofeedback\n- cognitive therapy for anxiety or clinical depression", "source": "wikidoc", "question": "According to authoritative guidelines, outline how you would assess an adult presenting with significant psychological stress and develop an individualized stress‑management plan: include which theoretical model(s) would guide your assessment and intervention choices (transactional vs health‑realization), criteria for selecting specific techniques (eg, cognitive therapy, relaxation, exercise, biofeedback, time‑management), how you would measure baseline and treatment response, and the expected physiological or clinical benefits."}
{"guideline_text": "Interleukin 6\nInterleukin 6 (IL-6) is an interleukin that acts as both a pro-inflammatory cytokine and an anti-inflammatory myokine. In humans, it is encoded by the IL6 gene.\nIn addition, osteoblasts secrete IL-6 to stimulate osteoclast formation.  Smooth muscle cells in the tunica media of many blood vessels also produce IL-6 as a pro-inflammatory cytokine.  IL-6's role as an anti-inflammatory myokine is mediated through its inhibitory effects on TNF-alpha and IL-1, and activation of IL-1ra and IL-10.\n\n# Function\n- IL-6 is an important mediator of fever and of the acute phase response.\n- It is capable of crossing the blood-brain barrier and initiating synthesis of PGE2 in the hypothalamus, thereby changing the body's temperature setpoint.\n- In muscle and fatty tissue, IL-6 stimulates energy mobilization that leads to increased body temperature.\n- IL-6 can be secreted by macrophages in response to specific microbial molecules, referred to as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). These PAMPs bind to an important group of detection molecules of the innate immune system, called pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), including Toll-like receptors (TLRs). These are present on the cell surface and intracellular compartments and induce intracellular signaling cascades that give rise to inflammatory cytokine production.\n- IL-6 is found in many supplemental cloning media such as briclone.\n- Inhibitors of IL-6 (including estrogen) are used to treat postmenopausal osteoporosis.\n- IL-6 is also produced by adipocytes and is thought to be a reason why obese individuals have higher endogeneous levels of CRP.\n- Intranasally administered IL-6 has been shown to improve sleep-associated consolidation of emotional memories.\n- IL-6 is responsible for stimulating acute phase protein synthesis, as well as the production of neutrophils in the bone marrow. It supports the growth of B cells and is antagonistic to regulatory T cells.\n- When psychologically stressed, the human body produces stress hormones like cortisol, which are able to trigger interleukin-6 release into the circulation.\n\n# Role as myokine\nIL-6 is also considered a myokine, a cytokine produced from muscle, which is elevated in response to muscle contraction. It is significantly elevated with exercise, and precedes the appearance of other cytokines in the circulation.  During exercise, it is thought to act in a hormone-like manner to mobilize extracellular substrates and/or augment substrate delivery.\nIL-6 has extensive anti-inflammatory functions in its role as a myokine. IL-6 was the first myokine that was found to be secreted into the blood stream in response to muscle contractions. Aerobic exercise provokes a systemic cytokine response, including, for example, IL-6, IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra), and IL-10. IL-6 was serendipitously discovered as a myokine because of the observation that it increased in an exponential fashion proportional to the length of exercise and the amount of muscle mass engaged in the exercise. It has been consistently demonstrated that the plasma concentration of IL-6 increases during muscular exercise. This increase is followed by the appearance of IL-1ra and the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. In general, the cytokine response to exercise and sepsis differs with regard to TNF-α. Thus, the cytokine response to exercise is not preceded by an increase in plasma-TNF-α. Following exercise, the basal plasma IL-6 concentration may increase up to 100-fold, but less dramatic increases are more frequent. The exercise-induced increase of plasma IL-6 occurs in an exponential manner and the peak IL-6 level is reached at the end of the exercise or shortly thereafter. It is the combination of mode, intensity, and duration of the exercise that determines the magnitude of the exercise-induced increase of plasma IL-6.\nIL-6 had previously been classified as a proinflammatory cytokine. Therefore, it was first thought that the exercise-induced IL-6 response was related to muscle damage. However, it has become evident that eccentric exercise is not associated with a larger increase in plasma IL-6 than exercise involving concentric \"nondamaging\" muscle contractions. This finding clearly demonstrates that muscle damage is not required to provoke an increase in plasma IL-6 during exercise. As a matter of fact, eccentric exercise may result in a delayed peak and a much slower decrease of plasma IL-6 during recovery.\nRecent work has shown that both upstream and downstream signalling pathways for IL-6 differ markedly between myocytes and macrophages. It appears that unlike IL-6 signalling in macrophages, which is dependent upon activation of the NFκB signalling pathway, intramuscular IL-6 expression is regulated by a network of signalling cascades, including the Ca2+/NFAT and glycogen/p38 MAPK pathways. Thus, when IL-6 is signalling in monocytes or macrophages, it creates a pro-inflammatory response, whereas IL-6 activation and signalling in muscle is totally\nindependent of a preceding TNF-response or NFκB activation, and is anti-inflammatory.\nIL-6, among an increasing number of other recently identified myokines, thus remains an important topic in myokine research. It appears in muscle tissue and in the circulation during exercise at levels up to one hundred times basal rates, as noted, and is seen as having a beneficial impact on health and bodily functioning when elevated in response to physical exercise. IL-6 was the first myokine that was found to be secreted into the blood stream in response to muscle contractions.\n\n# Receptor\nIL-6 signals through a cell-surface type I cytokine receptor complex consisting of the ligand-binding IL-6Rα chain (CD126), and the signal-transducing component gp130 (also called CD130). CD130 is the common signal transducer for several cytokines including leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), ciliary neurotropic factor, oncostatin M, IL-11 and cardiotrophin-1, and is almost ubiquitously expressed in most tissues. In contrast, the expression of CD126 is restricted to certain tissues. As IL-6 interacts with its receptor, it triggers the gp130 and IL-6R proteins to form a complex, thus activating the receptor. These complexes bring together the intracellular regions of gp130 to initiate a signal transduction cascade through certain transcription factors, Janus kinases (JAKs) and Signal Transducers and Activators of Transcription (STATs).\nIL-6 is probably the best-studied of the cytokines that use gp130, also known as IL-6 signal transducer (IL6ST),  in their signalling complexes. Other cytokines that signal through receptors containing gp130 are Interleukin 11 (IL-11), Interleukin 27 (IL-27), ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), cardiotrophin-1 (CT-1), cardiotrophin-like cytokine (CLC), leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), oncostatin M (OSM), Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus interleukin 6-like protein (KSHV-IL6). These cytokines are commonly referred to as the IL-6 like or gp130 utilising cytokines \nIn addition to the membrane-bound receptor, a soluble form of IL-6R (sIL-6R) has been purified from human serum and urine. Many neuronal cells are unresponsive to stimulation by IL-6 alone, but differentiation and survival of neuronal cells can be mediated through the action of sIL-6R. The sIL-6R/IL-6 complex can stimulate neurites outgrowth and promote survival of neurons and, hence, may be important in nerve regeneration through remyelination.\n\n# Interactions\nInterleukin-6 has been shown to interact with interleukin-6 receptor, and glycoprotein 130.\nThere is considerable functional overlap and interaction between Substance P (SP), the natural ligand for the neurokinin type 1 receptor (NK1R, a mediator of immunomodulatory activity) and IL-6.\n\n# Role in disease\nIL-6 stimulates the inflammatory and auto-immune processes in many diseases such as diabetes, atherosclerosis, depression, Alzheimer's Disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, multiple myeloma, prostate cancer, Behçet's disease, and rheumatoid arthritis.\nHence, there is an interest in developing anti-IL-6 agents as therapy against many of these diseases. The first such is tocilizumab, which has been approved for rheumatoid arthritis, Castleman's disease and systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis.  Others are in clinical trials.\n\n## Rheumatoid arthritis\nThe first FDA approved anti-IL-6 was for RA.\n\n## Cancer\nAnti-IL-6 therapy was initially developed for treatment of autoimmune diseases, but due to the role of IL-6 in chronic inflammation, IL-6 blockade was also evaluated for cancer treatment. IL-6 was seen to have roles in tumor microenvironment regulation, production of breast cancer stem cell-like cells, metastasis through down-regulation of E-cadherin, and alteration of DNA methylation in oral cancer.\nAdvanced/metastatic cancer patients have higher levels of IL-6 in their blood. One example of this is pancreatic cancer, with noted elevation of IL-6 present in patients correlating with poor survival rates.\n\n## Infectious diseases\n\n### Enterovirus 71\nHigh IL-6 levels are associated with the development of encephalitis in children and immunodeficient mouse models infected with Enterovirus 71; this highly contagious virus normally causes a milder illness called Hand, foot, and mouth disease but can cause life-threatening encephalitis in some cases. EV71 patients with a certain gene polymorphism in IL-6 also appear to be more susceptible to developing encephalitis.\n\n## Epigenetic modifications\nIL-6 has been shown to lead to several neurological diseases through its impact on epigenetic modification within the brain. IL-6 activates the Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway, and a downstream target of this pathway is the protein kinase B (PKB) (Hodge et al., 2007). IL-6 activated PKB can phosphorylate the nuclear localization signal on DNA methyltransferase-1 (DNMT1). This phosphorylation causes movement of DNMT1 to the nucleus, where it can be transcribed. DNMT1 recruits other DNMTs, including DNMT3A and DNMT3B, which, as a complex, recruit HDAC1. This complex adds methyl groups to CpG islands on gene promoters, repressing the chromatin structure surrounding the DNA sequence and inhibiting transcriptional machinery from accessing the gene to induce transcription. Increased IL-6, therefore, can hypermethylate DNA sequences and subsequently decrease gene expression through its effects on DNMT1 expression.\n\n### Schizophrenia\nThe induction of epigenetic modification by IL-6 has been proposed as a mechanism in the pathology of schizophrenia through the hypermethylation and repression of the GAD67 promoter. This hypermethylation may potentially lead to the decreased GAD67 levels seen in the brains of people with schizophrenia. GAD67 may be involved in the pathology of schizophrenia through its effect on GABA levels and on neural oscillations. Neural oscillations occur when inhibitory GABAergic neurons fire synchronously and cause inhibition of a multitude of target excitatory neurons at the same time, leading to a cycle of inhibition and disinhibition. These neural oscillations are impaired in schizophrenia, and these alterations may be responsible for both positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia.\n\n### Depression and major depressive disorder\nThe epigenetic effects IL-6 have also been implicated in the pathology of depression. The effects of IL-6 on depression are mediated through the repression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression in the brain; DNMT1 hypermethylates the BDNF promoter and reduces BDNF levels. Altered BDNF function has been implicated in depression, which is likely due to epigenetic modification following IL-6 upregulation. BDNF is a neutrophic factor implicated in spine formation, density, and morphology on neurons. Downregulation of BDNF, therefore, may cause decreased connectivity in the brain. Depression is marked by altered connectivity, in particular between the anterior cingulate cortex and several other limbic areas, such as the hippocampus. The anterior cingulate cortex is responsible for detecting incongruences between expectation and perceived experience. Altered connectivity of the anterior cingulate cortex in depression, therefore, may cause altered emotions following certain experiences, leading to depressive reactions. This altered connectivity is mediated by IL-6 and its effect on epigenetic regulation of BDNF.\nAdditional preclinical and clinical data, suggest that Substance P  and IL-6 may act in concert to promote major depression. SP, a hybrid neurotransmitter-cytokine, is co-transmitted with BDNF through paleo-spinothalamic circuitry from the periphery with collaterals into key areas of the limbic system. However, both IL6 and SP mitigate expression of BDNF in brain regions associated with negative affect and memory. SP and IL6 both relax tight junctions of the blood brain barrier, such that effects seen in fMRI experiments with these molecules may be a bidirectional mix of neuronal, glial, capillary, synaptic, paracrine, or endocrine-like effects. At the cellular level, SP is noted to increase expression of interleukin-6 (IL-6) through PI-3K, p42/44 and p38 MAP kinase pathways. Data suggest that nuclear translocation of NF-κB regulates IL-6 overexpression in SP-stimulated cells. This is of key interest as: 1) a meta-analysis indicates an association of major depressive disorder, C-reactive protein and IL6 plasma concentrations, 2) NK1R antagonists  studied by 3 independent groups in over 2000 patients from 1998-2013 validate the mechanism as dose-related, fully effective antidepressant,  with a unique safety profile. (see Summary of NK1RAs in Major Depression), 3) the preliminary observation that plasma concentrations of IL6 are elevated in depressed patients with cancer, and 4) selective NK1RAs may eliminate endogenous SP stress-induced augmentation of IL-6 secretion pre-clinically. These and many other reports suggest that a clinical study of a neutralizing IL-6 biological or drug based antagonist is likely warranted in patients with major depressive disorder, with or without co-morbid chronic inflammatory based illnesses; that the combination of NK1RAs and IL6 blockers may represent a new, potentially biomarkable approach to major depression, and possibly bipolar disorder.\nThe IL-6 antibody sirukumab is now undergoing clinical trials against major depressive disorder.\n\n## Asthma\nObesity is a known risk factor in the development of severe asthma. Recent data suggests that the inflammation associated with obesity, potentially mediated by the cytokine IL6, plays a role in causing poor lung function and increased risk for developing asthma exacerbations.", "source": "wikidoc", "question": "According to authoritative guidelines, discuss how the pathophysiological roles of interleukin‑6 (as described in the guideline) justify therapeutic IL‑6 blockade, specifying which diseases have approved anti‑IL‑6 therapy versus those for which anti‑IL‑6 agents are under investigation, and explain the mechanistic rationale and expected clinical effects of IL‑6 inhibition in these conditions."}
{"guideline_text": "Hemoglobin based oxygen carriers\n\n# Overview\nAt the beginning of 20th century excellent work of Landsteiner and co-authors combine with significant progress in fields of heart and circulation physiology initiated development of modern transfusion medicine allowing that blood transfusion become a standard part of medical treatment.\nComplexity of blood compatibility, lack of suitable anticoagulants, insufficient storage methods, and a disproportionate between demand and availability demonstrated in early the stages of transfusion medicine the need to find one universal blood substitute (red blood cells substitute or oxygen carrier substitute).\nPerfect \"blood substitute\" was defined as one which mimics the oxygen-carrying capacity of haemoglobin, which requires no cross-matching or compatibility testing, with a long shelf life, which exhibits a long intravascular half life (over days and weeks), and is free of side effects and pathogens. Two main types of blood substitutes are in development, haemoglobin-based oxygen carriers and perfluorocarbon emulsions.\nThe search for a haemoglobin-based oxygen carrier began during World War II, and stroma-free haemoglobin has been investigated as an oxygen carrier since the 1940s. Early attempts and optimism in developing haemoglobin-based oxygen carrier were very quickly confronted with significant side effects which at the level of knowledge and technology of the time, could not be promptly eliminated. To overcome this problem, several types of Hb modification methods (purification, cross-linkage, polymerisation)  were developed in a last few decades. The appearance of HIV and AIDS in the 1980s, HCV in 1990s and Creutzfeld-Jakob disease with increasing sensationalism was the impulse necessary to improve blood safety but also renewed impetus for development of infection safe blood substitutes. Actually several haemoglobin-based oxygen carriers were studied in a clinical trials. In general, the new generation of haemoglobin based oxygen carriers have been shown to successfully reduce or eliminate the need for allogeneic blood transfusions in patients under various clinical conditions. Taking into consideration that the major limitation of haemoglobin solutions is still the short intravascular half-life, haemoglobin solutions could serve mainly as a bridge to transfusion, rather than as a definitive replacement for blood. Accordingly, significant progress in development as well as in registration affairs, commercialization, and routine applications could be expected in next few years. Possibility do decrease need of packed red blood cells through application of haemoglobin-based oxygen carriers in a situation of continuos decline of blood donation combine with the increased demand for blood transfusion (increasing aging of population, increasing incidence of invasive diagnostic, etc) have to initiate strategy how to incorporate HBOCs in Blood Bank logistic and transfusion practice.\n\n# Introduction\nThe development of a “perfect” blood substitute has been ongoing for many years . Such a product would have certain advantages over human red cells,  including rapid and widespread availability, fewer requirements with regard to storage, transport, and compatibility testing, a longer shelf life, and a more consistent supply. An ideal substitute would be less antigenic than allogenic red cells, and would have less risk of disease transmission. Two main types of blood substitutes are in development; haemoglobin-based oxygen carrier (HBOCs) and perfluorocarbon emulsions . This review gives one short historical overview and summarised development and current clinical implementation of haemoglobin-based oxygen carriers. In addition we are attempting to initiate a development of strategy in regards to incorporation of  products in blood bank logistics and clinical practice.\n\n# Historical review and actual statement\nThe idea to use a blood substitute is old as well as human intention to resuscitate a life with transfusion of real blood. In the past, many but often obscure trials were conducted. One recommendation from Sir Christopher Wren (17th century) who suggested wine and opium as blood substitute . At the beginning of the 20th century, the development of modern transfusion medicine initiated through the excellent work of Landsteiner and co-authors opened the possibility to understanding the general principle of blood group serology . Simultaneously, significant progress was made in the fields of heart and circulation physiology as well as in the understanding of the mechanism of oxygen transport and tissue oxygenation . These two points paved the way for blood transfusion to become a standard part of medical treatment. Complexity of blood compatibility, lack of suitable anticoagulants and insufficient storage methods combined with a disproportion between demand and availability implicated just in early phase of transfusion medicine needs to find one universal blood substitute. The term \"blood substitute\" is a misnomer. Under the term blood substitute, we understand in first line the substitution of a) facility of red blood cells e.g. haemoglobin as oxygen carriers and b) volume substitution. More accurately the term means \"red-cell substitutes\" or solutions of “haemoglobin or non-haemoglobin based oxygen carriers”.\nRestrictions in applied transfusion medicine especially in disaster situations such as World War Two lay the grounds for an accelerated research in the field of blood substitutes . Early attempts and optimism in developing blood substitutes were very quickly confronted with significant side effects which according to for that time actual level of knowledge and technology could not be promptly eliminated. Appearance of HIV and infection in the 1980s with consecutive public sensibilisation was the impulse necessary to improve blood safety but also renewed impetus for development of infection-safe blood substitutes . This situation was more intense with the advent of HCV and Creutzfeld-Jakob Disease which showed the absence of absolutely safe blood . The continuous decline of blood donation combined with the increased demand for blood transfusion (increased ageing of population, increased incidence of invasive diagnostic, chemotherapy and extensive surgical interventions, terror attacks, international military conflicts) and positive estimation of investors in biotechnology branch make for a very positive environment for further development of blood substitutes . At the end of 2003 and March 2004  news that a selected patients in the Stockholm’s Karolinska Hospital and in two trauma centres in San Diego received red blood cell substitute without serious adverse events effects was just one positive reflection of  the described constellation.\nTaking into consideration that blood was used as resuscitation fluid with the main goal of improving oxygenation  research interest was in first line to develop substitute which  mimic oxygen-carrying capacity of haemoglobin. In addition,  an ideal blood substitute was define as one 1.) that required no cross-matching or compatibility testing; 2.) with a long shelf life over a wide range of ambient temperatures; 3.) which exhibit a long intravascular half life (over days and weeks) 4.) free of side effects and pathogens.\nUp until now, two types of oxygen carriers have been established: Perfluorocarbon emulsion and haemoglobin-based oxygen carrier (HBOCs)  . According to literature a significant increase of published case reports in which HOBC’s were under different conditions applied was observed in the last few year .\n\n# Haemoglobin-based oxygen carriers\nThe general task of blood within the frame of classic transfusion medicine is oxygen tissue supply (oxygen transport from lung to tissue, oxygen release and picking up carbon dioxide). All of this is accomplished with haemoglobin (Hb), the oxygen carrier protein contained within red cells. According to this simplified postulation, early attempts to develop blood substitutes was focused on simple cell-free solution of haemoglobin . \nHaemoglobin is a tetramer of two a and two b polypeptide chains, each of which is bound to an iron-containing heme group which each bind one oxygen molecule. This oxygen heme bond results in a conformational change in haemoglobin molecule, which progressively increases the affinity of haemoglobin for additional oxygen molecules. The main consequence is that the small change in oxygen partial pressure results in a large change in the amount of oxygen bound or released by the haemoglobin. This is widely known as oxygen-haemoglobin dissociation curves . Under conditions of increased pH or decreased temperature or 2,3 –diphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG, product of RBC glycolytic pathway) oxygen-haemoglobin dissociation curve is shifted to the left resulting in an increased affinity of haemoglobin for oxygen. In contrast, by decreased pH increased of temperature or an increase of 2,3-DPG-concentration curve is shifted to the right allowing the release of oxygen to tissue at higher than normal oxygen partial pressure . According to modern trends this ability today could be termed the „intelligent natural nanotechnique product“. However, it is of great importance that cell free haemoglobin maintains its ability to transport oxygen outside of the RBC. Stroma-free haemoglobin has been investigated as an oxygen carrier since the 1940s, when researchers realized that native haemoglobin is not antigenic. The ability to transport oxygen outside of the RBC and that application of haemoglobin solution did not require compatibility testing and allowed sterilisation promote isolated Hb as a substitute for red cells .\nFurther investigation and evaluation showed that unmodified cell-free haemoglobin had limitations, such as: an oxygen affinity that was too high for effective tissue oxygenation; a half-life within the intravascular space that was too short to be clinically useful; and a tendency to undergo dissociation in dimers with resultant renal tubular damage and toxicity . Early studies conducted in experimental animals showed that infusion of free haemoglobin caused also substantial increase in oncotic pressure because of its hyperosmolarity, coagulopathy, and hypertension . The general problem was that solutions of acellular haemoglobin were not as effective at oxygenation as packed red blood cells because of their high affinity for oxygen. Red blood cells have adapted to release oxygen at an oxygen half-saturation pressure of haemoglobin (P-50) of approximately 26.5 mm Hg, as a result of the allosteric effects of red bloods cell 2,3-disphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG), which shifts the oxyhaemoglobin curve to the right . Without 2,3-DPG, stroma-free haemoglobin has a P-50 of 12-14 mm Hg, not allowing for the adequate release of oxygen to the tissues. This sides effects have been attributed to dissociation of a2b2 tetramer to ab dimers (short intravascular half life, high oxygen affinity, nephrotoxicity), contamination with RBC stroma and affinity of Hb for nitric oxide (abdominal pain, vasoconstrictive crises) . To overcome this problems several types of Hb modification methods (purification, cross-linkage, polymerisation)  were developed in the last few decades .\nHaemoglobin can be cross-linked (a covalent bond between 2 globin chains is made through chemical modification), and then polymerised using reagents such as glutaraldehyde. These modifications result in a product that has a higher P50 than that of normal haemoglobin, and an increase in the plasma half life of up to 30 hours .\nPrevention of rapid breakdown of tetramer into dimer could improve half life and consecutive also eliminate nephrotoxicity. In a first generation of modified HBOCs specific chemical cross-links are established between haemoglobin polypeptide chain to prevent the dissociation of the Hb tetramer  into dimers. Haemoglobin treatment with 3,5-dibromosalycil fumarate established strong covalent bond between a subunits (aa-cross-linked-Hb) and successfully prevent rapid tetramere dissociation (half life 12 hours compare to 6 hours of unmodified Hb). Efficiency of cross-linked Hb to transport and unload O2 was confirmed in a variety of shock animal models and there is no doubt that modified Hb solutions improve tissue oxygenation in similar rate as infusion of autologes or allogenes blood . In such form stabilised haemoglobin (diaspirin cross-linked haemoglobin, DCLHb; trade name HemAssist; Baxter Healthcare Corp) reached Phase III clinical trials. This is the most widely studied of the haemoglobin-based blood substitutes, used in more than a dozen animal and clinical studies . It has the advantages of a shelf life of approximately 9 months frozen and 24 hours refrigerated. Its intravascular half-life is limited to 2-12 hours and is dose-dependent. In phase II clinical studies, HemAssist increased perfusion and oxygen consumption in patients with septic shock and in other critically ill patients. This product underwent phase III clinical trials for coronary artery bypass grafting procedures and was determined to decrease the need for transfused packed red blood cells. The adverse effects include hypertension and gastrointestinal distress. Observed vasoconstriction as serious side effects manifested as an increase in systemic and pulmonary artery pressure without normalizing cardiac output or restoring intravascular volume. Decreases in the cardiac index may impair optimum oxygen delivery and outweigh the advantage of an oxygen-carrying solution. Severe vasoconstriction complications was reason for terminating this clinical trial  . The possible vasoconstriction mechanism involved penetration of modified (but unpolymerised) Hb molecules into interstitial space of the subendothelial layers of vessel walls with consecutive nitric oxide scavenging and a sensitisation of peripheral a-adrenergic receptors. NO produced by endothelial cells affect smooth muscle cells of the vessel wall  and modulate the vascular tone toward vasodilatation. Extravased Hb scavenges NO and shift vasomotor tone toward vasoconstriction . This problem was relative successfully solved with polymerisation (o-rafinose, glutaraldehyde) of the haemoglobine molecule. For example glutaraldehyde target specific amino groups and polymerised haemoglobin (polyhaemoglobin). Polyhaemoglobin (Poly-Hb) composed from 4-5 Hb molecules shows variation in molecular size and configuration, has intrvascular dwell times up to 24 hours and does not penetrate (or reduced penetrate) to subendothelium. Alternative to polymerisation Hb can be conjugated to variety of larger molecules such as dextran, polyoxyethylene or could be genetic modified and residual tetramers are with additional methods removed. Although  these processes are designed to optimise cross-linking with consecutively reduction of  vasoconstrictive HBOCs effects and prolongation of intravascular half life .\nHemolink (Hemosol, Inc., Missiassauga, Canada) is a haemoglobin solution that contains cross-linked an o-rafinose polymerised human haemoglobin which is currently in Phase II trials in cardiothoracic surgery in USA. Previous conducted Phase III in Canada demonstrated the effectiveness of Hemolink as substitute to conventional transfusion in cardio surgery patients [15,16,17). The intravascular half-life is 18 to 20 hours. The mode of excretion is not entirely clear, but a small amount is renal. Phase I clinical trials in healthy volunteers showed that the drug is fairly well tolerated, with dose-dependent moderate or severe abdominal pain and increase in mean arterial pressure. \nTwo additional cross-linked polymers of bovine (Hemopure, Biopure, Cambridge, MA) and human (PolyHeme, Northfield Laboratories, Inc.) origin are being successfully applied in cardiac and abdominal surgery as well as in trauma patients . The intravascular half-life of Hemopure (polymerised form of bovine haemoglobin with a P-50 of 30 mm Hg)  is approximately 24 hours, and the excretion is non-renal . Administration of Hemopure leads to vasoconstrictive effects that may increase systemic and pulmonary vascular resistance with resultant decreases in cardiac index. The authors did emphasize that the product served as a bridge over days, until blood became available, or the patient’s own red cells were regenerated . Hemopure is undergoing phase III clinical trials as a perioperative alternative to red blood cell transfusion in orthopedic surgery in the United States, the European Union, Canada, and South Africa  .\nPolyHeme is made from pyridoxylated polymerized outdated human blood with an intravascular half-life of 24 hours and a shelf life of longer than 12 months (refrigerated). Its P-50 is 28-30 mm Hg, thereby giving it favorable oxygen-unloading characteristics. In a phase II randomised trial in patients with acute trauma, this product reduced the required number of allogeneic red blood cell transfusions. No adverse clinical events including vasoactive properties were observed in this trial . Currently, this product is undergoing phase III studies for the treatment of patients with significant acute blood loss.\nHowever, intensive studies conducted on animals as well as clinical observation showed the present generation of blood substitutes to successfully reduce or eliminate the demand for allogeneic blood transfusion . Even significant improved they are only oxygen carriers. The absence of enzymes which are integral to red blood cells and functional oxidation of Fe (II) to Fe (III) with consecutive formation of free radicals in some clinical situation could have deleterious effects .\nLack of tissue oxygen supply (severe haemorrhagic shock, stroke, myocardial infarction, organ transplantation) leads to ischaemia with alterations in metabolic reactions producing hypoxanthine and activating the enzyme xanthine oxidase. When the tissue is reperfused with oxygen carrying fluid, xanthine oxidase converts oxygen and hypoxanthine into superoxide. By several mechanisms, superoxide results in the formation of oxygen radicals with consecutive tissue injury . Superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) in red blood cell converts superoxide into hydrogen peroxide that is in turn converted into water and oxygen . Considering that the described oxygen carriers do not contain these enzymes, this application could cause increased ischaemia–reperfusion injury in certain conditions. Studies with polyhaemoglobin cross-linked with trace amounts of CAT and SOD showed that PolyHb–SOD–CAT removes significantly more oxygen radicals and peroxides, stabilizes the cross-linked haemoglobin and decreased oxidative iron and hem release and generally reduces ischemia-reperfusion injury . Cross-linking these enzymes to PolyHb is important because otherwise, free SOD and CAT are removed rapidly from the circulation. In the form of PolyHb–SOD–CAT, these enzymes circulate with a half-time more comparable with PolyHb which is about 24 h in human . A glutaraldehyde cross-linked bovine Hb was covalently attached with CAT and SOD in an attempt to prophylactically reduce ischemia-reperfusion injury (McGill University, Montreal Canada) is still in pre-clinical evaluation . In a study with the reperfusion of ischaemic rat intestine, PolyHb–SOD–CAT significantly reduced the increase in oxygen radicals caused by PolyHb. HemoZyme (SynZyme Technologies USA) is polynitroxylated human Hb designed to reduce oxidative potential of Hb is in pre-clinical evaluation .\nAlternatively to modified human or bovine Hb, the continuous development of recombinant techniques opened the possibility to the production of Hb in micro-organisms. So produced Hb is free from mammalian infectious agens and allowed possibility to be designed and constructed with specific conformational and functional characteristics that render them suitable for application in different clinical situations. In contrast to HBOCs solutions in which chemically modified Hb was present in heterogeneous mixture of different size polymers recombinant Hb represents homogeneous and stable polymer. Transfusion experiments performed on mice showed that recombinant Hb maintains physiologically relevant oxygen and heme affinity, stability toward denaturation and oxidation, and effective oxygen delivery as indicated by reduced cerebral ischemic damage .\nOne other form of HBOCs is encapsulated haemoglobin. In the 1950s, the first form of encapsulated haemoglobin was developed but limited technical possibility and absence of public interest slowed further development until the HIV crisis . Liposome-encapsulated haemoglobin (LEH) has been found to be an effective oxygen carrier, without the adverse effects of vasoconstriction . The liposome encapsulation appears to increase plasma retention time; however, adverse immune interactions occur with the liposome. Microcapsulation of Hb opens the possibility to constructing  real artificial red cells which contain some enzymes (SOD, CAT, reducing agents, 2,3 DPG) which are involved in reduction of ischemia reperfusion injury and solve problem of  methaemoglobin formation. This product is still in early experimental phase and large-scale production is considered difficult due to costs and technical constraints .\nAccording to different property of HBOCs (or different stages of development), side effects and intention of investors for a prompt commercialisation, some of these products are in different phase of clinical trial and some are still registered for human or animal application.\n\n# Conclusion and Perspectives\nIn general, haemoglobin-based oxygen carriers have been shown to reduce or eliminate the need for allogeneic blood transfusions in patients undergoing orthopaedic surgery, elective abdominal surgery, and coronary artery bypass graft surgery. Trauma victims can benefit from a rapidly available universal oxygen-carrying volume expander that does not require cross matching. HBOCs may also serve as a bridge to transfusion in patients for whom blood is temporarily difficult to find. They may also serve as a bridge in the temporary support of a patient who will not accept blood and who has a reasonable chance of recovering an adequate haemoglobin/ hematocrit within a few days. Blood substitutes  can also be used to prime cardioplegia machines during cardiac procedures in order to decrease the amount of packed red cells used. Given their low viscosity, substitutes can be used for reperfusion of ischemic organs during strokes or myocardial infarctions. These products potentially can serve as an organ preservative prior to organ transplantation in order to decrease reperfusion injury. Significant improvements in last few year have been made and some of the HOBCs have become available for routine use. The major limitation of haemoglobin solutions is still the short intravascular half-life. A transfused red cell can persist in the circulation for several weeks in a patient with no active bleeding or hemolysis. Taking into consideration that application of a haemoglobin solution requires frequent replacement significant costs could be considered. Because of this limitation, haemoglobin solutions could serve mainly as a bridge to transfusion, rather than as a definitive replacement for blood.\nAccording significant progress in development as well as in registration affairs commercialisation and routine apply could be expect in next few years. One other side clear regulatory guidelines for application of HBOCs is still not established. What we now need is one strategy when and under which condition HBOCs could and have to be transfused. It is of great importance to construct a framework for application of HBOCs based on one broad consensus of different clinical specialists under co-ordination of blood banks or blood institutes.\n\n# Military Use\nIn the 1980s, an HBOC was developed by the US Army at the Letterman Army Institute of Research (LAIR) which did not need typing. However, in clinical trials the HBOC were proven to be problematic, with more deaths using the HBOC than in the control group. Yet, their use would be of value to sustain the wounded in military conflicts. PolyHeme is currently in field trials with the US Army. Experiments continue (Blood volume and cardiac index in rats after exchange transfusion with haemoglobin-based oxygen carriers) with requirements include long shelf-life, no need for refrigeration, and minimal side-effects.

{"guideline_text": "Cushing's syndrome overview\n\n# Overview\nCushing's Syndrome is an  endocrine disorder caused by high levels of cortisol in the blood from a variety of causes, including primary pituitary adenoma (known as Cushing's disease), primary adrenal hyperplasia or neoplasia, ectopic ACTH production (e.g., from a small cell lung cancer), and iatrogenic (steroid use).  Cushing's syndrome was first identified by Dr. Harvey Cushing (an American physician, surgeon, and endocrinologist) in 1932 as a polyglandular disorder. It was later named as Cushing's syndrome. Normally, cortisol is released from the adrenal gland in response to ACTH being released from the pituitary gland. Both Cushing's syndrome and Cushing's disease are characterized by elevated levels of cortisol in the blood, but the cause of elevated cortisol differs between the two. Cushing's disease specifically refers to a tumor in the pituitary gland that stimulates the excessive release of cortisol from the adrenal gland by releasing large amounts of ACTH. In Cushing's disease, ACTH levels do not respond to negative feedback from the high levels of cortisol. Cushing's disease is particularly common in females. Annually, there are around 2–5 new cases per million people worldwide. Common risk factors in the development of Cushing's disease are female gender and genetic factors. Symptoms of Cushing's syndrome include  rapid weight gain, particularly of the trunk and face with sparing of the limbs (central obesity), a round face often referred to as a \"moon face\", excessive sweating, insomnia, reduced libido, impotence, amenorrhea, infertility and psychological disturbances, ranging from euphoria to psychosis. Depression and anxiety. Cushing's syndrome may progress to develop amenorrhoea, infertility, and psychological disturbances. If left untreated, patients with Cushing's syndrome may progress to develop diabetes, cardiovascular and psychiatric complications. The prognosis depends on the severity of the disease. When Cushing's is suspected, either a dexamethasone suppression test (administration of dexamethasone and frequent determination of cortisol and ACTH level) or a 24-hour urinary measurement for cortisol offer equal detection rates. Dexamethasone is a glucocorticoid and simulates the effects of cortisol, including negative feedback on the pituitary gland. When dexamethasone is administered and a blood sample is tested, high cortisol would be indicative of Cushing's syndrome. A novel approach, recently cleared by the US FDA, is sampling cortisol in saliva over 24 hours, which may be equally sensitive, as late night levels of salivary cortisol are high in Cushingoid patients. Other pituitary hormone levels may need to be ascertained. CT scan of the adrenal gland is performed to detect the presence of the adrenal adenoma and the cause of ectopic ACTH. CT scan is preferred over MRI in these cases. MRI of the pituitary gland is performed to detect the presence of the pituitary adenoma. The medications usually used for the treatment of Cushing's syndrome are Pasireotide, Cabergoline, Ketoconazole, and Metyrapone. The choice of medical therapy should be individualized. It is guided by drug efficacy, side effects, individual patient factors, and cost. If an adrenal adenoma is identified it may be removed by either laparoscopic or open adrenalectomy. An ACTH-secreting corticotrophic pituitary adenoma should be removed after diagnosis. Regardless of the adenoma's location, most patients will require steroid replacement postoperatively at least in the interim as long-term suppression of pituitary ACTH and normal adrenal tissue does not recover immediately. Clearly, if both adrenals are removed, replacement with hydrocortisone or prednisolone is imperative.\n\n# Historical Perspective\nCushing's syndrome was first identified by Dr. Harvey Cushing (an American physician, surgeon, and endocrinologist) in 1932 as a polyglandular disorder. It was later named as Cushing's syndrome.\n\n# Classification\nCushing's syndrome may be classified according to the source of cortisol into four subtypes; Endogenous, exogenous, familial Cushing's Syndrome, and pseudo-Cushing’s syndrome.\n\n# Pathophysiology\nBoth the hypothalamus and the pituitary gland are part of the brain. The hypothalamus releases corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), which stimulates the pituitary gland to release corticotropin (ACTH). ACTH travels via the blood to the adrenal gland, where it stimulates the release of cortisol. Cortisol is secreted by the cortex of the adrenal gland from a region called the zona fasciculata in response to ACTH. Elevated levels of cortisol exert negative feedback on the pituitary, which decreases the amount of ACTH released from the pituitary gland. Strictly, Cushing's syndrome refers to excess cortisol due to any etiology. One of the causes of Cushing's syndrome is a cortisol secreting adenoma in the cortex of the adrenal gland. The adenoma causes cortisol levels in the blood to be very high, and negative feedback on the pituitary from the high cortisol levels causes ACTH levels to be very low. Cushing's disease refers only to hypercortisolism secondary to excess production of ACTH from a corticotropic ] adenoma. This causes the blood ACTH levels to be elevated along with cortisol from the adrenal gland. The ACTH levels remain high because a tumor causes the pituitary to be unresponsive to negative feedback from high cortisol levels. Cortisol can also exhibit mineralocorticoid activity in high concentrations, causing worsening of hypertension and  hypokalemia (common in ectopic ACTH secretion).\n\n# Causes\nCushing’s syndrome occurs when the body is exposed to high levels of corticosteroids for a long period of time. Many people develop Cushing’s syndrome because they take glucocorticoids, (steroid hormones that are chemically similar to naturally produced cortisol) such as prednisone for asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, and other inflammatory diseases. Glucocorticoids are also used to suppress the immune system after transplantation to keep the body from rejecting the new organ or tissue. Other people may develop Cushing’s syndrome as a result of excessive cortisol production due to adrenal or extra-adrenal causes.\n\n# Differentiating (Disease name) from other Conditions\nCushing's syndrome must be differentiated from other diseases that cause hypertension, obesity, and hyperandrogenism, such as metabolic syndrome X and pseudo-Cushing's syndrome.\n\n# Epidemiology and Demographics\nCushing's disease is particularly common in females. Annually, there are around 2–5 new cases per million people worldwide.\n\n# Risk Factors\nCommon risk factors in the development of Cushing's disease are female gender and genetic factors.\n\n# Screening\nThere is insufficient evidence to recommend routine screening for Cushing's syndrome.\n\n# Natural History, Complications and Prognosis\nCushing's disease may present initially as rapid weight gain, a round face often referred to as a \"moon face\", and insomnia. It may progress to amenorrhoea, infertility, and psychological disturbances. If left untreated, patients with Cushing's syndrome may develop diabetes, cardiovascular and psychiatric complications. The prognosis depends on the severity of the disease.\n\n# Diagnosis\n\n## History and Symptoms\nSymptoms of Cushing's syndrome include  rapid weight gain, particularly of the trunk and face with sparing of the limbs (central obesity), a round face also known as a \"moon face\", excessive sweating, insomnia, reduced libido, impotence, amenorrhea, infertility and psychological disturbances, ranging from euphoria to psychosis and may also include depression and anxiety.\n\n## Physical Examination\nPatients with Cushing's syndrome usually appear obese. Physical examination of patients with Cushing's syndrome is remarkable for moon-like faces, easy bruising, purple skin stria, and hirsutism.\n\n## Laboratory Findings\nWhen Cushing's disease is suspected, either a dexamethasone suppression test (administration of dexamethasone and frequent determination of cortisol and ACTH level) or a 24-hour urinary measurement of cortisol may be used for detection. Dexamethasone is a glucocorticoid and simulates the effects of cortisol, including negative feedback on the pituitary gland. When dexamethasone is administered and a blood sample is tested, high cortisol would be indicative of Cushing's syndrome. A novel approach, recently cleared by the US FDA, is sampling cortisol in saliva over 24 hours, which may be equally sensitive, as late night levels of salivary cortisol are high in cushingoid patients. Other pituitary hormone levels may also need to be ascertained.\n\n## Electrocardiogram\nThere are no electrocardiogram findings associated with Cushing's syndrome.\n\n## Chest X Ray\nAnX-Ray may be helpful to identify the causes of ectopic ACTH in Cushing's syndrome such as lung carcinoma, bronchial carcinoid, and thymic carcinoid.\n\n## CT\nCT scan of the adrenal gland is performed to detect the presence of the adrenal adenoma and the cause of ectopic ACTH. CT scan is preferred over MRI in these cases.\n\n## MRI\nMRI of the pituitary gland is performed to detect the presence of the pituitary adenoma.\n\n## Echocardiography or Ultrasound\nThere are no electrocardiography or ultrasound findings associated with Cushing's disease.\n\n## Other Imaging Findings\nScintigraphy of the adrenal gland with iodocholesterol scan is occasionally necessary.\n\n# Treatment\n\n## Medical Therapy\nThe medications usually used for the treatment of Cushing's syndrome are pasireotide, cabergoline, ketoconazole, and metyrapone. The choice of medical therapy should be individualized. It is guided by drug efficacy, side effects, individual patient factors, and cost.\n\n## Surgery\nIf an adrenal adenoma is identified, it may be removed by either laparoscopic or open adrenalectomy.

{"guideline_text": "Global Pediatric Pulmonology Alliance (GPPA) proposal for COVID-19 vaccination in children\n\n\n\n## 1\nNational Immunization Program, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Beijing, China Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) remains a global epidemic. As of August 18, 2021, the number of reported cases has exceeded 207 million globally, with more than 4.3 million deaths. COVID-19 has brought devastating losses to human society. The overall crude mortality rate is 1-3%. Although pediatric deaths from COVID-19 are rare, they do occur, as over 9,000 children have died from COVID-19 globally to date. With the gradual and broad application of COVID-19 vaccines around the world, the rising proportion of cases among children and unvaccinated young adults demands attention. According to World Health Organization surveillance data, the proportion of children reported to have COVID-19 has increased. Between January 2020 and July 2021, the percentage of cases that occurred among children less than 5 years of age doubled, from 1% to 2%, and cases among 5-14 years more than tripled, from 2.5 to 8.7%. Between the initial stage of COVID-19 and the launch of vaccination efforts, children's COVID-19 infections were primarily family based, having been transmitted from adult to child. Recent variants, including the delta variant, appear to be transmitted more commonly in the young. Widespread adult vaccination with an increase in the proportion of childhood cases suggests that pediatric cases may become an important and growing source of COVID-19 infection in communities if children remain unvaccinated.\nIn addition to directly suffering from COVID-19, children suffer indirectly from the pandemic [bib_ref] Education and mental health: good reasons to vaccinate children, Cauchemez [/bib_ref]. By April 2021, an estimated 860,000 children have been orphaned or have lost a custodial grandparent due to a COVID-19 death [bib_ref] Global minimum estimates of children affected by COVID-19-associated orphanhood and deaths of..., Hillis [/bib_ref]. Many children have been pushed into poverty or have become malnourished as an indirect result of the pandemic. During school closures, children miss educational opportunities, some of which cannot be replaced and may lead to lower lifetime earnings. Therefore, protecting people who protect children-parents, grandparents, teachers, school staff, health care workers and others-is an important priority for COVID-19 vaccination as recommended by the WHO, especially while supplies of COVID-19 vaccine are limited.\nIt is well-recognized that vaccination is the best approach to stop COVID-19 epidemics. Vaccines help achieve a degree of community protection by establishing an immune barrier in the population rather than allowing massive spread of infection. Children and adolescents under 18 years of age are more than a quarter of the world's population. Immunity among children will be essential to achieve a level of population immunity high enough to dampen out community transmission. Children should be considered for COVID-19 vaccination not only for direct protection, but also because they contribute to transmission in families, day-care facilities, and schools, as exemplified by an outbreak in Australia.\nThere is a large and growing experience with COVID-19 vaccines. As of August 2021, over 4.4 billion doses of various COVID-19 vaccines have been administered to adults . Protective effectiveness of the vaccines, including reducing infection and transmission, disease severity, hospitalization, and death, have been affirmed along with their safety. Clinical trial and real-world evidence of safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines in children continues to accrue and is essential to be monitored carefully.\n\n## Proposal\nTo protect children and to prevent and help control COVID-19, the Global Pediatric Pulmonology Alliance (GPPA) organized an expert group to consider vaccination of children against COVID-19. Relying on evidence-based medicine and best practices in different nations, GPPA recommends that global and local organizations, medical societies, and health agencies join forces and commit fully to the protection of children from the harms caused by COVID-19.\nPeople who protect children and interact with children, such as parents and family members, educational staff, and health care workers, should be protected through COVID-19 vaccination.\nGPPA seeks to promote COVID-19 vaccination of children, incrementally, age group by age group, as COVID-19 vaccines are approved for administration to children and are recommended for children by national health authorities.\nMeasures to promote vaccination include strengthening education about direct and indirect benefits and safety of COVID-19 vaccination; enhancing public awareness of emerging recommendations for childhood vaccination; implementing recommended COVID-19 vaccinations of children by notifying families of recommended vaccination; making appointments to vaccinate as early as feasible; and vaccinating in a timely manner to reduce risk of COVID-19 outbreaks among children.\nWe believe that schools and communities should strengthen public education about children's vaccination policies, the safety of COVID-19 vaccines, and recommendations from clinical experts. Countries and regions where conditions permit should consider free vaccination in schools and community settings to increase vaccination rates. For countries and regions, where COVID-19 vaccination has not yet been included in national immunization plans, pediatricians should advocate for evidence-informed inclusion of children in national immunization programs.\nPediatricians can contribute to COVID-19 vaccination of children by:\n- Contributing expertise to health authority advisory groups that make recommendations for COVID-19 vaccination; - Closely following the progress of regulatory actions for COVID-19 vaccination of children, including ages and children's medical conditions for which vaccines can be administered; - Becoming familiar with emerging COVID-19 vaccine recommendations for children in their country or region;\n- Learning and keeping up-to-date with pediatric COVID-19 vaccine-specific indications, contraindications, and precautions; - Lending expertise to training sessions on best practices for COVID-19 immunization; - Using recommended best practices for COVID-19 vaccination in their own practices; - Ensuring full-series vaccination of all eligible children in their practice; - Reporting to health authorities breakthrough infections that occur after full-series vaccination; - Reporting to health authorities adverse events possibly related to COVID-19 vaccination.\nAn increasing number of COVID-19 vaccines are being approved for children by national regulatory authorities, and as evidence accrues the age range for vaccination is expanding to younger children. The indications for vaccination are expanding to ensure protection of children with serious comorbidities. Once eligible by age or by medical condition, children should be vaccinated as soon as feasible.\nCOVID-19 vaccines tend to be most effective at preventing serious illness and death, and less effective at preventing mild or asymptomatic infections. Because people with mild or asymptomatic infection, or those who are pre-symptomatic, are able to infect others, non-pharmaceutical interventions notified locally should always be observed and recommended to families, for schools, and for medical facilities and other places serving children.\nSchool, kindergarten and day-care staff should be fully vaccinated for their protection and for the protection of children. Public awareness and education efforts about infectious disease prevention and control and about vaccination should be made to increase vaccination rate and to prevent outbreaks. Children's family members and frequent visitors (such as caregivers, domestic service personnel, etc.) should be vaccinated.\nPediatric staff who have contact with children should be fully vaccinated. Because of the significantly increased transmission capability of COVID-19 variants, other staff in medical institutions, such as hospital sanitation workers and porters, also should be vaccinated. This will help protect pediatric workers and maintain medical care capacity by reducing staff sick leave risk of nosocomial infections.\n\n## Vaccination procedures\nPediatricians should consistently use general best practice guidelines for immunization in their COVID-19 vaccination effort. Using COVID-19 vaccines as approved and as recommended by health authorities will help ensure timely, safe, and effective protection of children. Pediatricians should ensure that all eligible children in their care are vaccinated 1 3 as expeditiously as possible, including children eligible by age and by medical condition or health status.\nChildren with chronic non-immune related diseases or with immune system disorders may have serious cases of COVID-19. Efforts need to be made to find appropriate safe and effective candidates from among the various types of available COVID-19 vaccines.\nPediatricians should screen for contraindications prior to vaccination. Contraindications to vaccination should follow national guidelines from health authorities and manufacturer prescribing instructions. Vaccinating professionals should become and stay familiar with COVID-19 vaccine contraindications, as these will change with emerging evidence and experience. In general, vaccination is contraindicated for individuals allergic to any ingredient of the vaccine, including substances used in the production process, or for individuals who have had an allergic reaction to a similar vaccine. Vaccination is usually contraindicated for individuals who have had a severe allergic reaction to vaccines in the past.\nPediatricians should screen for precautions before vaccination. Precautions for COVID-19 vaccination are specific to the vaccine and will change as evidence accrues. In general, precautions do not preclude vaccination, but they should be considered and discussed with parents/guardians before vaccinating. Precautions often include fever and acute illness, exacerbation of chronic illness, and history of Guillain-Barré syndrome. Pediatricians should keep up-to-date on the list of precautions for pediatric COVID-19 vaccination in their local area or region.\nMost health authorities recommend a brief, 15-30-min observation period after vaccination to identify and treat any immediate, severe allergic reaction among eligible adults. Follow-up care includes evaluation of medical concerns following vaccination and reporting of suspected adverse reactions and breakthrough infections to health authorities for evaluation. The same should be extended to include all eligible children as the vaccine is made available for them.\nIn summary, as soon as COVID-19 vaccines are approved and recommended for children, pediatricians should contribute their immunization expertise, advocate for inclusion of children in national COVID-19 immunization programs, and ensure timely vaccination of all eligible children in their practice and local area. As strong advocates for children, pediatricians can help safeguard children toward a healthy future and can contribute to the global effort to control the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAuthor contributions All authors contribute equally to this paper.

{"guideline_text": "Cyanide\nA cyanide is any chemical compound that contains the cyano group (C≡N), which consists of a carbon atom triple-bonded to a nitrogen atom.  Cyanide specifically is the anion CN-.  Many organic compounds feature cyanide as a functional group; these are called nitriles in IUPAC nomenclature (for example, CH3CN is referred to by the names acetonitrile or ethanenitrile per IUPAC, but occasionally it is labeled using the common name methyl cyanide).  Of the many kinds of cyanide compounds, some are gases, others are solids or liquids. Those that can release the cyanide ion CN- are highly toxic.\nThe word \"cyanide\" comes from the Greek word for \"blue\", in reference to hydrogen cyanide, which was called Blausäure (\"blue acid\") in German after its preparation by acid treatment of Prussian blue.\n\n# Appearance and odor\nHydrogen cyanide (HCN) is a colorless gas with a faint bitter almond-like odor. Most people can smell hydrogen cyanide; however, due to an apparent genetic trait, some individuals cannot detect the odor of HCN. Sodium cyanide and potassium cyanide are both white powders with a bitter almond-like odor in damp air, due to the presence of hydrogen cyanide formed by hydrolysis:\n\n# Occurrence\nCyanides are produced by certain bacteria, fungi, and algae and are found in a number of foods and plants. Cyanide is found, although in small amounts, in apple seeds, mangoes and almonds. In plants, cyanides are usually bound to sugar molecules in the form of cyanogenic glycosides and serve the plant as defense against herbivores. Cassava roots (aka manioc), an important potato-like food grown in tropical countries (and the base from which tapioca is made), contains cyanogenic glycosides.\nThe Fe-only and -hydrogenase enzymes contain cyanide ligands at their active sites.  The biosynthesis of cyanide in the -hydrogenases proceeds from carbamoylphosphate, which converts to cysteinyl thiocyanate, the CN- donor. \nHydrogen cyanide is a product of certain kinds of pyrolysis and consequently it occurs in the exhaust of internal combustion engines, tobacco smoke, and certain plastics, especially those derived from acrylonitrile.\n\n# Coordination chemistry\nCyanide is considered, in a broad sense, to be the most potent ligand for many transition metals.  The very high affinities of metals for cyanide can be attributed to its negative charge, compactness, and ability to engage in π-bonding.  Well known complexes include:\n- hexacyanides 3− (M = Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co), which are octahedral in shape;\n- the tetracyanides, 2− (M = Ni, Pd, Pt), which are square planar in their geometry;\n- the dicyanides − (M = Cu, Ag, Au), which are linear in geometry.\nThe deep blue pigment Prussian blue, used in the making of blueprints, is derived from iron cyanide complexes (hence the name cyanide, from cyan, a shade of blue). Prussian blue can produce hydrogen cyanide when exposed to acids.\n\n# Organic synthesis\nBecause of its high nucleophilicity, cyanide is readily introduced into organic molecules by displacement of a halide group (i.e. the chloride on methyl chloride).  Organic cyanides are generally called nitriles.  Thus, CH3CN can be methyl cyanide but more commonly is referred to as acetonitrile. In organic synthesis, cyanide is used as a C-1 synthon. I.e., it can be used to lengthen a carbon chain by one, while retaining the ability to be functionalized.\n- RCN + 2 H2O → RCOOH  +  NH3 (Hydrolysis under reflux with mineral acid catalyst), or\n- RCN + 0.5 LiAlH4  + (second step) 2 H2O  → RCH2NH2  +  0.5 LiAl(OH)4 (under reflux in dry ether, followed by addition of H2O)\nAn alternative method for introducing cyanide is via the process of hydrocyanation, whereby hydrogen cyanide and alkenes combine:\nRCH=CH2  +  HCN  →  RCH(CN)CH3\nMetal catalysts are required for such reactions.\n\n# Applications\nPotassium ferrocyanide is used to achieve a blue colour on cast bronze sculptures during the final finishing stage of the sculpture. On its own, it will produce a very dark shade of blue and is often mixed with other chemicals to achieve the desired tint and hue.  It is applied using a torch and paint brush while wearing the standard safety equipment used for any patina application: rubber gloves, safety glasses, and a respirator. The actual amount of cyanide in the mixture varies according to the recipes used by each foundry.\n\n## Medical uses\nThe cyanide compound sodium nitroprusside is occasionally used in emergency medical situations to produce a rapid decrease in blood pressure in humans; it is also used as a vasodilator in vascular research. The molecule of Vitamin B12 usually also contains cyanide. During World War I, a copper cyanide compound was briefly used by Japanese physicians for the treatment of tuberculosis and leprosy.\n\n## Mining\nGold and silver cyanides are among the very few soluble forms of these metals, and cyanides are thus used in mining as well as electroplating, metallurgy, jewelry, and photography.  In the so-called cyanide process, finely ground high-grade ore is mixed with the cyanide (concentration of about two kilogram NaCN per tonne); low-grade ores are stacked into heaps and sprayed with cyanide solution (concentration of about one kilogram NaCN per ton). The precious-metal cations are complexed by the cyanide anions to form soluble derivatives, e.g. − and −.\nSilver is less \"noble\" than gold and often occurs as the sulfide, in which case redox is not invoked (no O2 is required), instead a displacement reaction occurs:\nThe \"pregnant liquor\" containing these ions is separated from the solids, which are discarded to a tailing pond or spent heap, the recoverable gold having been removed.  The metal is recovered from the \"pregnant solution\" by reduction with zinc dust or by adsorption onto activated carbon. This process can result in environmental and health problems.  Aqueous cyanide is hydrolyzed rapidly, especially in sunlight.  It can mobilize some heavy metals such as mercury if present.  Gold can also be associated with arsenopyrite (FeAsS), which is similar to iron pyrite (fool's gold), wherein half of the sulfur atoms are replaced by arsenic. Au-containing arsenopyrite ores are similarly reactive toward cyanide.\n\n## Fishing\nCyanides are illegally used to capture live fish near coral reefs for the aquarium and seafood markets.  This fishing occurs mainly in the Philippines, Indonesia and the Caribbean to supply the 2 million marine aquarium owners in the world. In this method, a diver uses a large, needleless syringe to squirt a cyanide solution into areas where the fish are hiding, stunning them so that they can be easily gathered. Many fish caught in this fashion die immediately, or in shipping. Those that survive to find their way into pet stores often die from shock, or from massive digestive damage. The high concentrations of cyanide on reefs on which this has occurred has resulted in cases of cyanide poisoning among local fishermen and their families, as well as irreversible damage to the coral reefs themselves and other marine life in the area.\nEnvironmental organizations are critical of the practice, as are some aquarists and aquarium dealers, to prevent the trade of illegally-caught aquarium fish. The Marine Aquarium Council (Headquarters: Honolulu, Hawaii) has created a certification in which the tropical fish are caught legally with nets only.  To ensure authenticity, \"MAC-Certified marine organisms bear the MAC-Certified label on the tanks and boxes in which they are kept and shipped.\" MAC Certification.\nMagnesium cyanide is also used in some countries illegally to stun and harvest streamlined fish.\n\n## Fumigation\nCyanides are used as insecticides for the fumigating of ships. In the past cyanide salts have and still are in some places being used as rat poison, and for killing ants.\n\n# Chemical tests for cyanide\n\n### Prussian blue\nThe formation of Prussian blue can be used as a test for inorganic cyanide, for instance in the sodium fusion test.  Typically, iron(II) sulfate is added to a solution suspected of containing cyanide, such as the filtrate from the sodium fusion test. The resulting mixture is acidified with mineral acid. The formation of Prussian blue is a positive result for cyanide.\n\n### para-benzoquinone in DMSO\nA solution of para-benzoquinone in DMSO reacts with cyanide to form  a cyanophenol, which is fluorescent. Illumination with a UV light gives a green/blue glow if the test is positive.\n\n### Copper and an aromatic amine\nAs used by fumigators to detect hydrogen cyanide, copper(II) salt and an aromatic amine such as benzidine is added to the sample, as an alternative to the benzidine an alternative amine di-(4,4-bis-dimethylaminophenyl) methane can be used. A positive test gives a blue colour.  Copper(I) cyanide is poorly soluble. By sequestering the copper(I) the copper(II) is rendered a stronger oxidant. The copper, in a cyanide facilitated oxidation, converts the amine into a coloured compound. The Nernst equation explains this process. Another good example of such chemistry is the way in which the saturated calomel reference electrode (SCE) works. The copper, in a cyanide facilitated, oxidation converts the amine into a coloured compound.\n\n### Pyridine - Barbituric Acid Colorimetry\nA sample containing cyanide is purged with air from a boiling acid solution into a basic absorber solution. The cyanide salt absorbed in the basic solution is buffered at pH 4.5 and then reacted with chlorine to form cyanogen chloride. The cyanogen chloride formed couples pyridine with barbituric acid to form a strongly colored red dye that is proportional to cyanide concentration. This colorimetric method following distillation is the basis for most regulatory methods (for instance EPA 335.4) used to analyze cyanide in water, wastewater, and contaminated soils. Distillation followed by colorimetric methods, however, have been found to be prone to interferences from thiocyanate, nitrate, thiosulfate, sulfite, and sulfide that can result in both positive and negative bias. It has been recommended by the USEPA (MUR March 12, 2007) that samples containing these compounds be analyzed by Gas-Diffusion Flow Injection Analysis - Amperometry.\n\n### Gas Diffusion Flow Injection Analysis - Amperometry\nInstead of distilling, the sample is injected into an acidic stream where the HCN formed is passed under a hydrophobic gas diffusion membrane that selectively allows only HCN to pass through. The HCN that passes through the membrane is absorbed into a basic carrier solution that transports the CN to an amperometric detector that accurately measures cyanide concentration with high sensitivity. Sample pretreatment determined by acid reagents, ligands, or preliminary UV irradiation allow cyanide speciation of free cyanide, available cyanide, and total cyanide respectively. These relative simplicity of these flow injection analysis methods limit the interference experienced by the high heat of distillation and also prove to be cost effective since time consuming distillations are not required.\n\n# Toxicity\nMany cyanide-containing compounds are highly toxic, but some are not.  Prussian blue, with an approximate formula Fe7(CN)18 is the blue of blue prints and is administered orally as an antidote to poisoning by thallium and Caesium-137. The most dangerous cyanides are hydrogen cyanide (HCN) and salts derived from it, such as potassium cyanide (KCN) and sodium cyanide (NaCN), among others.   Also some compounds readily release HCN or the cyanide ion, such as trimethylsilyl cyanide (CH3)3SiCN upon contact with water and cyanoacrylates upon pyrolysis.\nCyanide is an inhibitor of the enzyme cytochrome c oxidase (also known as aa3) in the fourth complex of the electron transport chain (found in the membrane of the mitochondria of eukaryotic cells.)  It attaches to the iron within this protein.  The binding of cyanide to this cytochrome prevents transport of electrons from cytochrome c oxidase to oxygen. As a result, the electron transport chain is disrupted, meaning that the cell can no longer aerobically produce ATP for energy.  Tissues that mainly depend on aerobic respiration, such as the central nervous system and the heart, are particularly affected.  Antidotes to cyanide poisoning include hydroxocobalamin and sodium nitrite which release the cyanide from the cytochrome system, and rhodanase, which is an enzyme occurring naturally in mammals that combines serum cyanide with thiosulfate, producing comparatively harmless thiocyanate.\nCyanides have been used as a poison many times throughout history. Its most infamous application was the use of hydrogen cyanide by the Nazi regime in Germany for mass murder in some gas chambers during the Holocaust. Cyanide has been used for murder, as in the case of Grigori Rasputin. It has also been used for suicide. Some notable cases are Erwin Rommel, Eva Braun, Wallace Carothers, Hermann Göring, Heinrich Himmler, Alan Turing, Odilo Globocnik, Adolf Hitler (in combination with a gunshot), residents of Jim Jones' the People's Temple in Jonestown and the LTTE (they use it to kill themselves if they are captured by Armed forces).", "source": "wikidoc", "question": "According to authoritative guidelines, outline a structured approach to a patient with suspected acute cyanide poisoning, including: the key pathophysiological features and high‑risk exposures to elicit, the bedside and laboratory/analytical tests you would use to confirm or support the diagnosis (with their strengths/limitations), and the immediate antidotal management strategy—explaining the indications and mechanisms of hydroxocobalamin, sodium nitrite, and thiosulfate/rhodanase-based therapy."}
{"guideline_text": "Cefazolin Sodium Injection (patient information)\n\n# About your treatment\nYour doctor has ordered cefazolin, an antibiotic, to help treat your infection. The drug will be either injected into a large muscle (such as your buttock or hip) or added to an intravenous fluid that will drip through a needle or catheter placed in your vein for 30 minutes, two to four times a day.\nCefazolin eliminates bacteria that cause many kinds of infections, including lung, skin, bone, joint, stomach, blood, heart valve, and urinary tract infections. This medication is sometimes prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.\nYour health care provider (doctor, nurse, or pharmacist) may measure the effectiveness and side effects of your treatment using laboratory tests and physical examinations. It is important to keep all appointments with your doctor and the laboratory. The length of treatment depends on how your infection and symptoms respond to the medication.\n\n# Precautions\nBefore administering cefazolin:\n- tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to cefazolin, any other cephalosporin , penicillins, or any other drugs.\n- tell your doctor and pharmacist what prescription and nonprescription medications you are taking, especially other antibiotics, probenecid (Benemid), and vitamins.\n- tell your doctor if you have or have ever had kidney, liver, or gastrointestinal disease (especially colitis).\n- tell your doctor if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breast-feeding. If you become pregnant while taking cefazolin, call your doctor.\n- if you have diabetes and regularly check your urine for sugar, use Clinistix or TesTape. Do not use Clinitest tablets because cefazolin may cause false positive results.\n\n# Administering your medication\nBefore you administer cefazolin, look at the solution closely. It should be clear and free of floating material. Gently squeeze the bag or observe the solution container to make sure there are no leaks. Do not use the solution if it is discolored, if it contains particles, or if the bag or container leaks.

{"guideline_text": "Psychosurgery\nPsychosurgery is a term for surgeries of the brain involving procedures that modulate the performance of the brain, and thus effect changes in cognition, with the intent to treat or alleviate severe mental illness. It was originally thought that by severing the nerves that give power to ideas you would achieve the desirable result of a loss of affect and an emotional flattening which would diminish creativity and imagination; the idea being that those are the human characteristics that are disturbed.  Historically, the procedure typically considered psychosurgery, prefrontal leukotomy is now almost universally shunned as inappropriate, due in part to the emergence of less-invasive or less-objectionable methods of treatment such as psychiatric medication and modified electroconvulsive therapy. In modern neurosurgery however, more minimally invasive techniques like gamma knife irradiation and foremost deep brain stimulation have arisen as novel tools for psychosurgery.\n\n# History\nThere is evidence that trepanning (or trephining)—the practice of drilling holes in the skull for pseudomedical reasons—has been in widespread, if infrequent, use since 5000 BC. This may have been done in an attempt to allow the brain to expand in the case of increased brain fluid pressure, for example, after head injuries. (Several documented cases of healed wounds indicate that such crude surgery could be survived back then.) However, psychosurgery as understood today was not commonly practiced until the early 20th century.\nThe first systematic attempts at human psychosurgery occurred from 1935, when the neurosurgeon Egas Moniz teamed up with the surgeon Almeida Lima at the University of Lisbon to perform a series of prefrontal lobotomies —a procedure severing the connection between the prefrontal cortex and the rest of the brain.\nMoniz and Lima claimed fair results, especially in the treatment of depression, although about 6% of patients did not survive the operation, and there were often marked and adverse changes in the patients' personality and social functioning. Despite the risks the process was taken up with some enthusiasm, notably in the U.S., as a treatment for previously incurable mental conditions. Moniz received a Nobel Prize in 1949.\nThe initial criteria for treatment were quite steep—only a few conditions of \"tortured self-concern\" were put forward for treatment. Severe chronic anxiety, depression with risk of suicide and incapacitating obsessive-compulsive disorder were the main symptoms treated. The original lobotomy was a crude operation and the practice was soon developed into a more exact stereotactic procedure where only very small lesions were placed in the brain.\n\n## \"Ice pick lobotomy\"\nPsychosurgery was popularised in the United States when Walter Freeman invented the \"ice pick lobotomy\", a procedure which literally used an ice pick and a rubber mallet instead of standard surgical equipment to perform a transorbital lobotomy. Leaving no visible scars, the ice pick lobotomy was heralded as a great advance in surgery, and was eventually done under local anesthesia accomplished through electroshock administered to the patient moments before the procedure.\nIn what is now widely considered to be a highly invasive procedure, Freeman would hammer the ice pick into the skull just above the tear duct and wiggle it around. From 1936 through the 1950s, he advocated lobotomies throughout the United States. Such was Freeman's zeal that he began to travel around the nation in his own personal van, which he called his \"lobotomobile\", demonstrating the procedure in many medical centres. He reputedly even performed a few lobotomies in hotel rooms.\nFreeman's advocacy led to great popularity for lobotomy as a general cure for all perceived ills, including misbehaviour in children. Ultimately between 40,000 and 50,000 patients were lobotomised. A follow-up study of almost 10,000 patients claimed 41% were \"recovered\" or \"greatly improved\", 28% were \"minimally improved\", 25% showed \"no change\", 4% had died, while only 2% were made worse off (Tooth, et al. 1961).\n\n# Neurological effect\nThe frontal lobe of the brain controls a number of advanced cognitive functions, as well as motor control. Motor control is located at the rear of the frontal lobe, and is usually unaffected by psychosurgery. The anterior or prefrontal area is involved in impulse control, judgement with everyday life and situations, language, memory, motor function, problem solving, sexual behaviour, socialization and spontaneity. Frontal lobes assist in planning, coordinating, controlling and executing behaviour.\nThus, the efficacy of psychosurgery was often related to changes in personality and reduced spontaneity (this included making the person quieter and decreasing their craving to be sexually active). Certain processes related to schizophrenia are also believed to occur in the frontal lobe, and may explain some success. However, certain types of inappropriate behaviours increased as a function of reduced impulse control (in some respects they became more childlike). Further, it decreased their ability to function as a member of the community by reducing their problem solving and planning abilities and making them less flexible and adaptive. It usually had no bearing on IQ except with respect to problem solving.\n\n# Present day\nLobotomies gradually became unfashionable with the development of antipsychotic drugs and are rarely performed. The era of lobotomy is now generally regarded as a barbaric episode in psychiatric history. There was a strong division amongst the medical profession as to the efficacy of the treatment, and concern over both the irreversible nature of the operation and to its extension into the treatment of unsuitable cases (drug or alcohol dependence, sexual disorders, etc). Psychosurgery was offered in only a few centres, and by the 1960s the number of operations was in decline. Signal improvements in psychopharmacology and behaviour therapy provided the opportunity for more effective and less-invasive treatment.\nToday, psychosurgery may be a treatment of last resort for OCD sufferers, and for anorexic patients in Chile, the United States, Sweden and Mexico. The efficacy is not high: one study of cingulotomy (which usually involves a 2–3 cm lesion in the cingulum near the corpus callosum) found improvement in 5 out of 18 patients (Baer et al., 1995).\nPsychosurgery is legally practiced in controlled and regulated U.S. centers, or in Finland, Sweden, United Kingdom, Spain, India, Belgium and Netherlands. In France, 32 psychosurgical operations were made between 1980 and 1986 according to an IGAS report; about 15 each year in the UK, 70 in Belgium, and about 15 for the Massachusetts General Hospital of Boston.\nSome consider use of endoscopic sympathetic block (a form of endoscopic thoracic sympathectomy) for patients with anxiety disorder to be a psychiatric treatment, despite it not being surgery of the brain. There is also renewed interest in using it to treat schizophrenia.. ESB disrupts brain regulation of many organs normally affected by emotion, such as the heart and blood vessels. A large study demonstrated significant reduction in \"alertness\" and \"fear\" in patients with social phobia as well as improvement in their quality of life . ESB for anxiety is advocated as an alternative by surgeons on the internet , most psychologists, however, prefer medication and counseling.\n\n# Legal restrictions\nIn 1977, the U.S. Congress created a National Committee for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research to investigate allegations that psychosurgery, including lobotomy techniques, was used to control minorities, restrain individual rights or that it had unethical after-effects. It concluded that, in general, psychosurgery had positive effects. However, concerns about lobotomy steadily grew, and countries such as Germany, Japan and several U.S. states prohibited it.\nIn Australia, psychosurgery is performed by a select group of neurosurgeons. In Victoria, each individual operation must receive the consent of a Review Board before it may proceed.\nThe Soviet Union made lobotomies illegal in 1950..\n\n# Individuals who underwent lobotomy\n- Phineas Gage: Famously suffered an accident in 1848 which severely damaged his frontal lobe. The effects were comparable to a surgical lobotomy.\n- Josef Hassid: Polish violin prodigy and schizophrenic who died at 26.\n- Rosemary Kennedy: Sister of John F. Kennedy.\n- Rose Williams: Sister of Tennessee Williams.\n- Howard Dully: One of Walter Freeman's youngest victims, author of My Lobotomy (2007)\n\n# Fictional examples\n- Frances Farmer: Though Farmer is the person perhaps best associated in the public mind with lobotomy due to its depiction in the fictionalized biographical film Frances, archival medical and other records have conclusively proven Farmer never underwent the procedure.  The author who initially alleged the lobotomy later admitted in court he had made it up. (Footnoted site contains court transcripts which are also available through LexisNexis.)\n- Ken Kesey's famed fictional character, Randle Patrick McMurphy, in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest who was, in the movie, played by Jack Nicholson.\n- J.

Therefore, Valcyte tablets cannot be substituted for ganciclovir capsules on a one-to-one basis .\n- Adult patients should use Valcyte tablets, not Valcyte for oral solution.\n\n## Adult Patients With Normal Renal Function\nFor dosage recommendations in adult patients with renal impairment see Dosage and Administration (2.5).\nTreatment of CMV Retinitis:\n- Induction: The recommended dose is 900 mg (two 450 mg tablets) twice a day for 21 days.\n- Maintenance: Following induction treatment, or in adult patients with inactive CMV retinitis, the recommended dose is 900 mg (two 450 mg tablets) once a day.\nPrevention of CMV Disease:\n- For adult patients who have received a heart or kidney-pancreas transplant, the recommended dose is 900 mg (two 450 mg tablets) once a day starting within 10 days of transplantation until 100 days post-transplantation.\n- For adult patients who have received a kidney transplant, the recommended dose is 900 mg (two 450 mg tablets) once a day starting within 10 days of transplantation until 200 days post-transplantation.\n\n## Pediatric Patients\nPrevention of CMV Disease:For pediatric patients 4 months to 16 years of age who have received a kidney or heart transplant, the recommended once daily dose of Valcyte starting within 10 days of transplantation until 100 days post-transplantation is based on body surface area (BSA) and creatinine clearance (CrCl) derived from a modified Schwartz formula, and is calculated using the equation below:\n- Pediatric Dose (mg) = 7 × BSA × CrCl (calculated using a modified Schwartz formula). If the calculated Schwartz creatinine clearance exceeds 150 mL/min/1.73m2, then a maximum value of 150 mL/min/1.73m2 should be used in the equation.\nwhere k =\n0.45 for patients aged 4 months to < 1 year,\n0.45 for patients aged 1 to < 2 years (note k value is 0.45 instead of the typical value of 0.55),\n0.55 for boys aged 2 to < 13 years and girls aged 2 to 16 years, and\n0.7 for boys aged 13 to 16 years.\nAll calculated doses should be rounded to the nearest 25 mg increment for the actual deliverable dose. If the calculated dose exceeds 900 mg, a maximum dose of 900 mg should be administered. Valcyte for oral solution is the preferred formulation since it provides the ability to administer a dose calculated according to the formula above; however, Valcyte tablets may be used if the calculated doses are within 10% of available tablet strength (450 mg). For example, if the calculated dose is between 405 mg and 495 mg, one 450 mg tablet may be taken.\n\n## Preparation of Valcyte for Oral Solution\nPrior to dispensing to the patient, Valcyte for oral solution must be prepared by the pharmacist as follows :\n- Measure 91 mL of purified water in a graduated cylinder.\n- Shake the Valcyte bottle to loosen the powder. Remove the child resistant bottle cap and add approximately half the total amount of water for constitution to the bottle and shake the closed bottle well for about 1 minute. Add the remainder of water and shake the closed bottle well for about 1 minute. This prepared solution contains 50 mg of valganciclovir free base per 1 mL.\n- Remove the child resistant bottle cap and push the bottle adapter into the neck of the bottle.\n- Close bottle with child resistant bottle cap tightly. This will assure the proper seating of the bottle adapter in the bottle and child resistant status of the cap.\n- Store constituted oral solution under refrigeration at 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F) for no longer than 49 days.

{"guideline_text": "Beta-glucan\nβ-Glucans (or beta-glucans) are polysaccharides occurring in the bran of cereal grains, the cell wall of baker's yeast, certain types of fungi, and many kinds of mushrooms. The cereal based beta glucans occur most abundantly in barley and oats and to a much lesser degree in rye and wheat. They are useful in human nutrition as texturing agents and as soluble fiber supplements, but problematic in brewing as excessive levels make the wort too viscous. An insoluble (1,3/1,6) beta glucan derived from baker's yeast has a different molecular structure than that of its soluble (1,3/1,4) counterparts and has a greater biological activity due to its structural \"branching\". Yeast derived beta glucans are notable for their immunomodulatory function. The differences between soluble and insoluble beta glucans are significant in regards to application, mode of action, and overall biological activity.\n\n# Overview\nGlucans are polysaccharides that only contain glucose as structural components. Beta 1, 3-D glucans are chains of D-glucose molecules, with the six-sided D-glucose rings connected at the 1 and 3 positions.  Smaller side chains branch off the 1,3 polysaccharide “backbone.” The most active form of Beta 1, 3-D glucans are apparently those that contain 1,6 side-chains branching off from the longer beta-1,3 glucan backbone.  These are referred to as beta-1,3/1,6 glucan. Some researchers have suggested that it is the frequency, location, and length of the side-chains rather than the backbone of beta glucans that determine their immune system activity.  Another variable is the fact that some of these compounds exist as single strand chains, while the backbones of other beta-1,3 glucans exist as double or triple stranded helix chains.  In some cases, proteins linked to the beta-1,3 glucan backbone may also be involved in providing therapeutic activity.  Although these compounds have exciting potential for enhancement of the immune system, it must be emphasized that this research is in its infancy, and there are differing opinions on which molecular weight, shape, structure, and source of beta-1, 3 glucans provide the greatest therapeutic benefit.\nOne of the most common sources of Beta 1, 3-D glucan is derived from the cell wall of baker’s yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae). However, beta-1,3 glucans are also extracted from the bran of some grains such as oats and barley.  The Beta 1, 3-D glucans from yeast are often insoluble whereas those extracted from grains tend to be soluble.  Other sources include some types of seaweed , and various species of mushrooms such as Reishi, Shiitake, and Maitake.\nBeta 1, 3-D glucans are being referred to as biological response modifiers because of their ability to activate the immune system. However, it should be noted that the activity of Beta 1, 3-D glucan is different from agents that stimulate the immune system. Agents that stimulate the immune system can push the system to over-stimulation, and hence are contraindicated in individuals with autoimmune diseases, allergies, or yeast infections.  Beta 1, 3-D glucans seem to make the immune system work better without becoming overactive. They accomplish this by activating phagocytes, which are immune system cells whose function is to trap and destroy foreign substances in our bodies such as bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites. In addition to enhancing the activity of phagocytes, beta-1,3 glucans also reportedly lower elevated levels of LDL cholesterol, aid in wound healing, help prevent infections, enhance NK cell function, and help in the prevention and treatment of cancer.\n\n# Clinical Applications (conclusions of investigators)\n· Cancer: β-Glucan has been used as an immunoadjuvant therapy for cancer since 1980, primarily in Japan. Numerous studies report that beta-1, 3 glucan has anti-tumor and anti-cancer activity.  In one study, intralesional administration of beta-1,3 glucans resulted in rapid tumor shrinkage. In another study with mice, beta 1,3 glucan in conjunction with interferon gamma inhibited both the establishment of tumors and liver metastasis. In some studies, beta-1,3 glucans enhanced the effects of chemotherapy. In studies on bladder cancer with mice, administration of cyclophosphamide, in conjunction with beta-1,3 glucans derived from yeast resulted in reduced mortality. In human patients with advanced gastric or colorectal cancer, the administration of beta-1,3 glucans derived from shiitake mushrooms, in conjunction with chemotherapy resulted in prolonged survival times compared to a control group receiving identical chemotherapy.\nPreclinical studies have shown that a soluble yeast β-glucan product, Imprime PGG, when used in combination with certain monoclonal antibodies or cancer vaccines, offers significant improvements in long-term survival versus monoclonal antibodies alone. This benefit, however, does not result from Betafectin enhancing the specific killing action of the antibody. The anti-tumor activity is caused by a unique killing mechanism that involves neutrophils that are primed with Betafectin and which are not normally involved in the fight against cancer. Recent research by Hong et al, demonstrates that this mechanism of action is effective against a broad range of cancers when used in combination with specific monoclonal antibodies that activate or cause complement to be bound to the tumor. The complement enables these primed neutrophils to find and bind to the tumor, which facilitates killing. Innate immune cells are the body’s first line of defense and circulate throughout the body engaging in an immune response against “foreign” challenges (bacteria, fungus, parasites). Typically, neutrophils are not involved in the destruction of cancerous tissue because these immune cells view cancer as \"self\" rather than foreign or \"non-self.\" Current cancer immunotherapies involve monoclonal antibodies and vaccines, which stimulate the acquired immune response, but do nothing to change the innate immune system's view of cancer as \"self.\" As a result the monoclonal antibodies alone do not engage or initiate the potential killing ability of the innate immune system, which is our primary mechanism of defense against bacteria and yeast (fungal) infections.\nDr. Gordon Ross and Dr. Vaclav Vetvicka, respected immunologists and cancer researchers at the University of Louisville, discovered that a receptor on the surface of these innate immune cells called Complement Receptor 3 ( CR3 or CD11b/CD18) was responsible for binding to fungi or yeast, allowing the immune cells to recognize them as \"non-self.\" This receptor is a dual occupancy receptor in that it has two binding sites. The first site is responsible for binding to a type of complement, a soluble blood protein, known as C3 (or iC3b). C3 becomes attached to pathogens that specific antibodies have targeted and opsonized. The second site of this receptor binds to a carbohydrate on yeast or fungal cells that allows the innate immune cell to recognize yeast and fungi as being \"non-self ”. Both of these receptor sites must be simultaneously occupied to trigger the innate immune cell to destroy the yeast or fungi. Two obstacles prevent neutrophils from using this mechanism of action against cancer. First, the body usually does not generate enough natural antibodies to bind to the tumor, and this prevents the activation and attachment of (or “fixing”) complement to the surface of the cancer cell. Therefore, neutrophils don’t bind to cancer via the first receptor site of CR3. The second obstacle is that even when the natural antibody response is supplemented with monoclonal antibodies that fix complement and binding occurs at the first site, tumors do not contain a foreign carbohydrate serving as “second signal” on their surface that allows neutrophils to recognize the cancer as \"non-self “.\nDr. Ross discovered that a bio-processed fragment of Imprime PGG specifically binds to the second CR3 receptor site on neutrophils. When neutrophils bind to tumors, the Betafectin allows them to “see” cancer as if it were a yeast or fungal pathogen and provide the “second signal” to trigger killing. In summary, Betafectin engages neutrophils in the fight against cancer, dramatically and synergistically enhancing the effectiveness of complement activating monoclonal antibodies and vaccines through a different killing mechanism.\nMultinational research has successfully demonstrated that the oral form of yeast Beta 1,3-D glucan has similar protective effects as the injected version, including defense against infectious diseases and cancer. Recently, orally-delivered glucan was found to significantly increase proliferation and activation of monocytes in peripheral blood of patients with advanced breast cancer.\nThe technology has wide applicability for cancer therapy.  Each form of cancerous tumor cell has specific antigens on the cell surface, some of which are common to other types of cancer. (Example: Mucin 1 is present on about 70% of all types of cancer cells) Different immunotherapies target different antigens for binding monoclonal antibodies to tumor cells. This has resulted in the development of hundreds of monoclonal antibodies, many targeting a different specific antigen on cancer cells. In research studies, Betafectin has improved the effectiveness of all complement-activating monoclonal antibodies tested including breast, liver and lung cancer (company data). The magnitude of success varies based on the specific monoclonal antibody used and the type of cancer.\n·        Prevention of infection: To date there have been numerous studies and clinical trials conducted with the soluble yeast β-glucan and the whole glucan particulate.  These studies have ranged from the impact of β-glucan on post-surgical nosocomial infections to the role of yeast β-glucans in treating anthrax infections.\nPost-surgical infections are a serious challenge following major surgery with estimates of 25-27% infection rates post-surgery. Alpha-Beta Technologies conducted a series of human clinical trials in the 1990’s to evaluate the impact of β-glucan therapy for controlling infections in high-risk surgical patients. In the initial trial 34 patients were randomly (double-blind, placebo-controlled) assigned to treatment or placebo groups. Patients that received the PGG-glucan had significantly fewer infectious complications than the placebo group (1.4 infections per infected patient for PGG-glucan group vs. 3.4 infections per infected patient for the placebo group).  Additional data from the clinical trial revealed that there was decreased use of intravenous antibiotics and shorter stays in the intensive care unit for the patients receiving PGG-glucan vs. patients receiving the placebo.\nA subsequent human clinical trial  further studied the impact of β-glucan for reducing the incidence of infection with high-risk surgical patients. The authors found a similar result with a dose-response trend (higher dose provided greater reduction in infectious occurrences than low doses). In the human clinical trial 67 patients were randomized and received either a placebo or a dose of 0.1, 0.5, 1.0 or 2.0 mg PGG-Glucan per KG of body weight.  Serious infections occurred in four patients that received the placebo, three patients that received the low dose (0.1 mg/KG) of PGG-Glucan and only one infection was observed at the highest dose of 2.0 mg/KG of PGG-Glucan.\nThe results of a phase III human clinical trial showed that PGG-Glucan therapy reduced serious post-operative infections by 39% after high-risk noncolorectal operations. This study was conducted in patients that were already as high-risk because of the type of surgery and were more susceptible to infections and other complications.\nAt this point in the development of an injectable form of b-glucan (Betafectin PGG-glucan) most scientists already concluded that yeast-derived b-glucan promoted phagocytosis and subsequent killing of pathogenic bacteria. A phase III clinical trial was proposed and conducted at thirty-nine medical centers in the U.S. involving 1,249 subjects stratified according to colorectal or non-colorectal surgical patients. The PGG-glucan was given once pre-operatively and three times post-operative at 0, 0.5 or 1.0 mg/kg body weight. The measured outcome was serious infection or death of the subjects within 30 days post-surgery. The results of the phase III human clinical trial showed that injectable PGG-Glucan therapy reduced serious post-operative infections by 39% after high-risk noncolorectal operations.\nThere have been studies with humans and animal models that further support the efficacy of β-glucan in combating various infectious diseases. One human study demonstrated that consumption of oral whole glucan particles increased the ability of immune cells to consume a bacterial challenge (phagocytosis). The total number of phagocytic cells and the efficiency of phagocytosis in healthy human study participants increased while consuming a commercial particulate yeast β-glucan. This study demonstrated the potential for yeast β-glucan to increase the reaction rate of the immune system to infectious challenges.  The study concluded that oral consumption of whole glucan particles represented a good enhancer of natural immunity.\nAnthrax is a disease that cannot be tested in human studies for obvious reasons.  In a study conducted by the Canadian Department of Defense, Dr. Kournikakis showed that orally administered yeast β-glucan given with or without antibiotics protected mice against anthrax infection. A dose of antibiotics along with oral whole glucan particles (2 mg/KG body weight or 20 mg/KG body weight) for eight days prior to infection with Bacillus anthracis protected mice against anthrax infection over the 10-day post-exposure test period.  Mice treated with antibiotic alone did not survive.\nA second experiment was conducted to investigate the effect of yeast β-glucan orally consumed after exposure of mice to B. anthracis. The results were similar to the previous experiment with an 80-90% survival rate for mice treated with β-glucan, but only 30% for the control group after 10-days of exposure.  The hopeful inference is that similar results would be observed with humans.\nSince there are many commercial products on the market called “glucan”, there is much confusion among consumers as to which type(s) may be the most effective. One of the most comprehensive published studies to date showed Glucan #300, a highly purified yeast glucan, to be “the biologically most relevant immunomodulator” out of a wide ranging group.\n·        Radiation exposure: β-glucan is a well-known biological response modifier (BRM) isolated from the yeast cell wall polysaccharides and is made up entirely of glucose β(1,3)-linked together in linear chains with variable frequency of β(1,6)-linked side chains. Specific hematopoietic activity was first demonstrated with β-glucan in the mid-1980s in an analogous manner as granulocyte monocyte–colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF).Research was carried out initially with particulate β-glucan and later with soluble β-glucans, all of which were administered intravenously to mice.Mice exposed to 500-900 cGy (500-900 mrads) of gamma radiation exhibited a significantly enhanced recovery of blood leukocyte, platelet and red blood cell counts when given i.v. β-glucan. Other reports showed that β-glucan could reverse the myelo-suppression produced with chemotherapeutic drugs such as fluorouracil, carboplatinum or cyclophosphamide. Moreover, the anti-infective activity of β-glucan combined with its hematopoiesis-stimulating activity resulted in enhanced survival of mice receiving a lethal dose of 900-1200 cGy of radiation. In vitro studies showed that β-glucan could enhance granulocyte and megakaryocyte colony formation by hematopoietic stem progenitor cells when used in combination with GM-CSF and interleukin-3 (IL-3), respectively.\nOriginal studies delivered glucan almost entirely by injection. Later, numerous studies tried to evaluate the possibility that glucan can be delivered orally without compromising its biological activities,opening the oral route of administration as a more pleasant alternative. A study by Allendorf et al. clearly demonstrated that oral Beta glucan had hematopoietic effects analogous to Beta glucan administered by i.v. methods, work of Vetvicka’s group showed the mechanisms of the glucan transfer through the gastrointestinal tract. Allendorf et al. demonstrated that orally administered whole glucan particulate functions to accelerate hematopoiesis following irradiation in an analogous manner as i.v. administered β-glucan. Experiments by Cramer et al. or Vetvicka  clearly demonstrated that oral β-glucan stimulates hematopoiesis in radiation-treated mice. Currently, there is renewed interest in the potential usefulness of β-glucan as a radioprotective drug for chemotherapy, radiation therapy and nuclear emergencies, particularly because glucan can be used not only as a treatment, but also as a prophylactic.\n·        Septic shock: One of the mechanisms of the immune-enhancing ability of yeast β-glucan is its ability to prime leukocytes to more easily locate and kill non-self cells including bacteria.  Early research by Onderdonk et al. investigated the ability of yeast b-glucan to reduce septic infections using in vivo models. Onderdonk et al. found that mice challenged with E. coli or S. aureus bacteria were protected against septic infections when they were injected with PGG-glucan 4–6 hours prior to infection. Additional research further supports that yeast β-glucan reduces septic shock by killing bacteria present in blood. Work by Kernodle et al. demonstrated that preventative dosing of yeast β-glucan prior to infection with S. aureus prevented sepsis in a guinea pig model.  Research on the use of yeast β-glucan immunomodulators as a means of treating and preventing bacterial sepsis is well documented. Recent reports on glucan and sepsis revealed another possible mechanism - glucan protects against oxidative organ injury.\n·        Surgery:  There have been numerous studies and clinical trials conducted with the soluble yeast β-glucan particle and the whole glucan particle. Immunomodulators that enhance macrophage function have been shown to be beneficial in human, as well as, animal models. One such study that looked at this correlation examined wound tensile strength and collagen biosynthesis. Positive effects were observed.\nIn a prospective, randomized, double-blind study, 38 trauma patients received an I.V. of a soluble yeast derived glucan for 7 days or placebo. The total mortality rate was significantly less in the glucan group (0% vs. 29%). There was also a decrease in septic morbidity (9.5% vs. 49%). Further such trials to evaluate Biological Response Modifiers (BRM’s) in trauma patients are indicated.\nYeast derived beta glucan significantly enhanced phagocytic activity in control and operated mice. In an experimental C. albicans model, mice had induced sepsis along with a midline laparotomy. The non-operated mice on glucan had a 100% survival vs. 73% in the surgical group. Detrimental effects of surgery on survival of C. albicans infection manifested in a 47% survival in the non-surgical vs a 20% survival in the surgery-infected group.\nThe nonspecific immunostimulation of yeast derived glucan appears to have significant potential as a treatment strategy against post-operative infections. In a post splenectomy mouse model, glucan increased survival vs. controls via 75% as opposed to 27%, Severe sepsis enhances risks in both adult and pediatric patients. These works suggest another option beyond prophylactic antibiotics and bacterial vaccines that often have limited success against morbidity and mortality.\n·        Wound healing: Macrophage activity is known to play a key role in wound healing from surgery or trauma. In both animal and human studies, therapy with Beta glucan has provided improvements such as fewer infections, reduced mortality, and stronger tensile strength of scar tissue.\n·        Allergic rhinitis: This disease is caused by an IgE-mediated allergic inflammation of the nasal mucosa. Orally-administered yeast-glucan decreased levels of IL-4 and IL-5 cytokines responsible for the clinical manifestation of this disease, while increased the levels of IL-12. Based on these studies, glucan may have a role as an adjunct to standard treatment in patients with allergic diseases.\n·        Arthritis: Using paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, yeast-derived glucan was found to cause decline in oxidative tissue damage during the progress of arthritic diseases, suggesting the role in treatment of arthritis.\n·        Additional functions: Influence of certain cereals (barley, oats) and edible mushrooms upon decrease of levels of serum cholesterol and liver low-density lipoproteins, leading to lowering of arteriosclerosis and heart disease hazards, is also mediated by b-glucan. It is known that cereals, mushrooms and yeast facilitate bowel motility and can be used in amelioration of intestinal problems, particularly obstipation. Non-digestible b-glucans, forming a remarkable portion of these materials, are also able to modulate mucosal immunity of the intestinal tract. In the central nervous system, β-glucans activate microglial cells. These cells act as scavengers of the brain cell debris and play a positive role in Alzheimer’s disease, AIDS, ischemia injury and multiple sclerosis.\n\n# Functions in the Body\nBeta-1,3 glucans improve the body’s immune system defense against foreign invaders by enhancing the ability of macrophages, neutrophils and natural killer cells to respond to and fight a wide range of challenges such as bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites.\nSymptoms and Causes of Deficiency: Beta-1, 3 glucans do not occur naturally in humans, hence no deficiency condition exists.\nAbsorption: For best results, Beta 1, 3-D glucan should be taken on an empty stomach.  Enterocytes reportedly facilitate the transportation of beta-1, 3 glucans and similar compounds across the intestinal cell wall into the lymph where they begin to interact with macrophages to activate immune function. Radiolabeled studies have verified that both small and large fragments of beta glucans are found in the serum, which indicates they are absorbed from the intestinal tract. M cells within the Peyer’s Patches physically transport the insoluble whole glucan particles into the GALT.\nDietary Sources: Although beta-1 3 glucans occur in baker’s yeast, seaweed, grains such as oats and barley, and numerous mushrooms, they are not readily usable in their natural state.  The indigestible cell walls of these substances must be processed in order to free up the beta-1, 3 glucans and make them available for useful purposes.\n\n# Yeast Derived Beta Glucan\nYeast Beta 1, 3-D Glucan\nThese are sometimes seen as synonyms:\nβ-Glucan | (1,3/1,6)-β-D-glucan | whole glucan particulate | 1,3/1,6 glucan | (1→3,1→6) glucan\nDosage Range: From 40 mg to 3000 mg daily.\nMost Common Dosage: Variable, depending upon body weight and whether it is being used for maintenance or an acute condition.  As a dietary supplement (maintenance use), the most common dose range has been reported as 40-500 mg per day.  When the dosage is reported on a kilogram of body weight basis the dose range is 2-6 mg/kg.  If the particulate glucan is being self-administered for an acute condition, a higher dose of 500-3000 mg/day is typically administered.\nActive Forms: Immune-enhancing activity has been reported for Beta 1, 3-D glucan with 1,6 glucan side chains, which are derived from yeasts. Many varieties of mushrooms have also been reported that have a Beta-1,3/1,4 glucan linkage, similar to glucans from oats and barley.\nDosage Forms:  As a dietary supplement the most common forms are capsules and tablets.

{"guideline_text": "Encephalitis lethargica\n\n# Overview\nEncephalitis lethargica (EL) is an atypical form of encephalitis. Also known as sleeping sickness (though different from the sleeping sickness transmitted by the tsetse fly), EL is a devastating illness that swept the world in the 1920s and then vanished as quickly as it had appeared. First described by the neurologist Constantin von Economo in 1916, EL attacks the brain, leaving some victims in a statue-like condition, speechless and motionless. Between 1917 and 1928, an epidemic of encephalitis lethargica spread throughout the world, but no recurrence of the epidemic has since been reported, though isolated cases continue to occur. During the outbreak over 5 million died from disease-related causes.\n\n# Symptoms\nEncephalitis lethargica is characterized by high fever, sore throat, headache, double vision, delayed physical and mental response, sleep inversion, catatonia and lethargy. In acute cases, patients may enter a coma-like state (akinetic mutism). Patients may also experience abnormal eye movements, parkinsonism, upper body weakness, muscular pains, tremors, neck rigidity, and behavioral changes including psychosis.\nPostencephalitic Parkinson's disease may develop after a bout of encephalitis, sometimes as long as a year after the start of the illness.\n\n# Cause\nThe cause of encephalitis lethargica is not known for certain.\nResearch in 2004 suggested that the disease is due to an immune reaction. In this study, many of the people with encephalitis lethargica had experienced recent pharyngitis and the authors found some evidence linking the reaction to prior strep throat. They hypothesised that encephalitis lethargica, Sydenham's chorea and PANDAS (paediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infections) are mediated by variations of the post-streptococcal immune response.\nThere is also some evidence of an autoimmune origin with antibodies (IgG) from patients with EL binding to neurons in the basal ganglia and mid-brain.Western immunoblotting showed that 95% of EL patients had autoantibodies reactive against human basal ganglia antigens.By contrast, antibodies reactive against the basal ganglia were found in only 2-4% of child and adult controls (n = 173, P < 0.0001). \nSome researchers believe that new data supports the influenza hypothesis, while others consider this less likely.\n\n# Treatment\nTreatment for encephalitis lethargica in the early stages is patient stabilization, which may be very difficult. There is little evidence so far of a consistent effective treatment for the initial stages, though some patients given steroids have seen improvement. Other patients have been less fortunate, and the disease then becomes progressive, with evidence of brain damage similar to Parkinson's disease. Treatment is then symptomatic. Levodopa (L-dopa) and other anti-parkinson drugs often produce dramatic responses. However in most of the patients who were given L-Dopa in the 1960s, the amelioration of the disease was short lived.\nThe course of encephalitis lethargica varies depending upon complications or accompanying disorders.", "source": "wikidoc", "question": "According to authoritative guidelines, discuss the recommended clinical approach to a patient suspected of having encephalitis lethargica, including initial stabilization priorities, the role and evidence for immunotherapy (eg, corticosteroids), investigations that support an autoimmune or post-infectious aetiology, and the management of subsequent post‑encephalitic parkinsonism (including expected benefits and limitations of levodopa and other symptomatic treatments)."}
{"guideline_text": "KCNE3\nPotassium voltage-gated channel, Isk-related family, member 3 (KCNE3), also known as MinK-related peptide 2 (MiRP2)  is a protein that in humans is encoded by the KCNE3 gene.\n\n# Function\nVoltage-gated potassium channels (Kv) represent the most complex class of voltage-gated ion channels from both functional and structural standpoints. Their diverse functions include regulating neurotransmitter release, heart rate, insulin secretion, neuronal excitability, epithelial electrolyte transport, smooth muscle contraction, and cell volume. KCNE3 encodes a member of the five-strong KCNE family of voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channel ancillary or β subunits.\nKCNE3 is best known for modulating the KCNQ1 Kv α subunit, but it also regulates hERG, Kv2.1, Kv3.x, Kv4.x and Kv12.2 in heterologous co-expression experiments and/or in vivo.\nCo-assembly with KCNE3 converts KCNQ1 from a voltage-dependent delayed rectifier K+ channel to a constitutively open K+ channel with an almost linear current/voltage (I/V) relationship. KCNQ1-KCNE3 channels have been detected in the basolateral membrane of mouse small intestinal crypts, where they provide a driving force to regulate Cl- secretion. Specific amino acids within the transmembrane segment (V72) and extracellular domain (D54 and D55) of KCNE3 are important for its control of KCNQ1 voltage dependence. D54 and D55 interact electrostatically with R237 in the S4 segment of the KCNQ1 voltage sensor, helping to stabilize S4 in the activated state, which in turn locks open the channel unless the cell is held at a strongly hyperpolarizing (negative) membrane potential. The ability of KCNQ1-KCNE3 channels to remain open at weakly negative membrane potentials permits their activity in non-excitable, polarized epithelial cells such as those in the intestine.\nKCNE3 also interacts with hERG, and when co-expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes KCNE3 inhibits hERG activity by an unknown mechanism. It is not known whether hERG-KCNE3 complexes occur in vivo.\nKCNE3 interacts with Kv2.1 in vitro and forms complexes with it in rat heart and brain. KCNE3 slows Kv2.1 activation and deactivation. KCNE3 can also regulate channels of the Kv3 subfamily, which are best known for permitting ultrarapid firing of neurons because of the extremely fast gating (activation and deactivation). KCNE3 moderately slows Kv3.1 and Kv3.2 activation and deactivation, and moderately speeds their C-type inactivation.  It is possible that KCNE3 (and KCNE1 and 2) regulation of Kv3.1 and Kv3.2 helps to increase functional diversity within the Kv3 subfamily. KCNE3 also regulates Kv3.4, augments its current by increasing the unitary conductance and by left-shifting the voltage dependence such that the channel can open at more negative voltages. This may allow Kv3.4-KCNE3 channels to contribute to setting resting membrane potential.\nKCNE3 inhibits the fast inactivating Kv channel Kv4.3, which generates the transient outward Kv current (Ito) in human cardiac myocytes).  similarly, KCNE3 was recently found to inhibit Kv4.2, and it is thought that this regulation modulates spike frequency and other electrical properties of auditory neurons.\nKv12.2 channels were found to be inhibited by endogenous KCNE3 (and KCNE1) subunits in Xenopus laevis oocytes. Thus, silencing of endogenous KCNE3 or KCNE1 using siRNA increases the macroscopic current of exogenously expressed Kv12.2. Kv12.2 forms a tripartite complex with KCNE1 and KCNE3 in oocytes, and may do so in mouse brain. Previously, endogenous oocyte KCNE3 and KCNE1 were also found to inhibit exogenous hERG activity and slow the gating of exogenous Kv2.1.\n\n# Structure\nKCNE proteins are type I membrane proteins, and each assembles with one or more types of Kv channel α subunit to modulate their gating kinetics and other functional parameters. KCNE3 has a larger predicted extracellular domain, and smaller predicted intracellular domain, in terms of primary structure, when compared to other KCNE proteins. As with other KCNE proteins, the transmembrane segment of KCNE3 is thought to be α-helical, and the extracellular domain also adopts a partly helical structure.  KCNE3, like KCNE1 and possibly other KCNE proteins, are thought to make contact with the S4 of one α subunit and the S6 of another α subunit within the tetramer of Kv α subunits in a complex. No studies have as yet reported the number of KCNE3 subunits within a functional channel complex; it is likely to be either 2 or 4.\n\n# Tissue distribution\nKCNE3 is most prominently expressed in the colon, small intestine, and specific cell types in the stomach.  It is also detectable in the kidney and trachea, and depending on the species is also reportedly expressed at lower levels in the brain, heart and skeletal muscle. Specifically, KCNE3 was detected in rat, horse and human heart, but not in mouse heart. Some have observed KCNE3 expression in rat brain, rat and human skeletal muscle, and the mouse C2C12 skeletal muscle cell line, others have not detected it in these tissues in the mouse.\n\n# Clinical significance\nGenetic disruption of the Kcne3 gene in mice impairs intestinal cyclic AMP-stimulated chloride secretion via disruption of intestinal KCNQ1-KCNE3 channels that are important for regulating the chloride current.  KCNE3 also performs a similar function in mouse tracheal epithelium. Kcne3 deletion in mice also predisposes to ventricular arrhythmogenesis, but KCNE3 expression is not detectable in mouse heart. The mechanism for ventricular arrhythmogenesis was demonstrated to be indirect, and associated with autoimmune attack of the adrenal gland and secondary hyperaldosteronism (KCNE3 is not detectable in the adrenal gland).  The elevated serum aldosterone predisposes to arrhythmias triggered in a coronary artery ligation ischemia/reperfusion injury model.  Blockade of the aldosterone receptor with spironolactone removed the ventricular arrhythmia predisposition in Kcne3-/- mice.  Kcne3 deletion also impairs auditory function because of the loss of regulation of Kv4.2 channels by KCNE3 in spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) of the auditory system. KCNE3 is thought to regulate SGN firing properties and membrane potential via its modulation of Kv4.2.\nMutations in human KCNE3 have been associated with hypokalemic periodic paralysis and Brugada syndrome.\nThe association with the R83H mutation in KCNE3 is controversial and other groups have detected the same mutation in individuals not exhibiting symptoms of periodic paralysis. The mutation may instead be a benign polymorphism, or else it requires another genetic or environmental 'hit' before it becomes pathogenic.  Kv channels formed by Kv3.4 and R83H-KCNE3 have impaired function compared to wild-type channels, are less able to open at negative potentials and are sensitive to proton block during acidosis.\nKCNE3-linked Brugada syndrome is thought to arise because of mutant KCNE3 being unable to inhibit Kv4.3 channels in ventricular myocytes as it is suggested to do in healthy individuals. It appears that, unlike in mice, KCNE3 expression is detectable in human heart. It has not been reported whether people with KCNE3 mutations also have adrenal gland-related symptoms such as hyperaldosteronism.\nKCNE3 mutations have been suggested to associate with Ménière’s disease in Japanese, a condition that presents as tinnitus, spontaneous vertigo, and periodic hearing loss, however this association is also controversial and was not observed in a Caucasian population.  In a study of tinnitus utilizing deep resequencing analysis, the authors were not able to prove or disprove association of KCNE3 sequence variation with tinnitus.", "source": "wikidoc", "question": "According to authoritative guideline text, discuss the clinical significance of KCNE3 variants: describe the tissues in which KCNE3 is expressed, the proposed molecular mechanisms by which KCNE3 dysfunction produces hypokalemic periodic paralysis, Brugada syndrome, auditory deficits and predisposition to ventricular arrhythmia (including the indirect aldosterone-mediated mechanism shown in mice), summarize the key controversies or uncertainties in genotype–phenotype associations (including R83H and Ménière’s disease/tinnitus), and outline the potential diagnostic and therapeutic implications that follow from these findings."}

{"guideline_text": "Rizatriptan clinical pharmacology\n\n# Clinical Pharmacology\n\n### 12.1 Mechanism of Action\nRizatriptan binds with high affinity to human cloned 5-HT1B/1D receptors. MAXALT presumably exerts its therapeutic effects in the treatment of migraine headache by binding to 5-HT1B/1D receptors located on intracranial blood vessels and sensory nerves of the trigeminal system.\n\n### 12.3 Pharmacokinetics\n\n### Absorption\nRizatriptan is completely absorbed following oral administration. The mean oral absolute bioavailability of the MAXALT Tablet is about 45%, and mean peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) are reached in approximately 1-1.5 hours (Tmax). The presence of a migraine headache did not appear to affect the absorption or pharmacokinetics of rizatriptan. Food has no significant effect on the bioavailability of rizatriptan but delays the time to reach peak concentration by an hour. In clinical trials, MAXALT was administered without regard to food.\nThe bioavailability and Cmax of rizatriptan were similar following administration of MAXALT Tablets and MAXALT-MLT Orally Disintegrating Tablets, but the rate of absorption is somewhat slower with MAXALT-MLT, with Tmax delayed by up to 0.7 hour. AUC of rizatriptan is approximately 30% higher in females than in males. No accumulation occurred on multiple dosing.\n\n### Distribution\nThe mean volume of distribution is approximately 140 liters in male subjects and 110 liters in female subjects. Rizatriptan is minimally bound (14%) to plasma proteins.\n\n### Metabolism\nThe primary route of rizatriptan metabolism is via oxidative deamination by monoamine oxidase-A (MAO-A) to the indole acetic acid metabolite, which is not active at the 5-HT1B/1D receptor. N-monodesmethyl-rizatriptan, a metabolite with activity similar to that of parent compound at the 5-HT1B/1D receptor, is formed to a minor degree. Plasma concentrations of N-monodesmethyl-rizatriptan are approximately 14% of those of parent compound, and it is eliminated at a similar rate. Other minor metabolites, the N-oxide, the 6-hydroxy compound, and the sulfate conjugate of the 6-hydroxy metabolite are not active at the 5-HT1B/1D receptor.\n\n### Elimination\nThe total radioactivity of the administered dose recovered over 120 hours in urine and feces was 82% and 12%, respectively, following a single 10-mg oral administration of 14C-rizatriptan. Following oral administration of 14C-rizatriptan, rizatriptan accounted for about 17% of circulating plasma radioactivity. Approximately 14% of an oral dose is excreted in urine as unchanged rizatriptan while 51% is excreted as indole acetic acid metabolite, indicating substantial first pass metabolism.\nThe plasma half-life of rizatriptan in males and females averages 2-3 hours.\n\n### Cytochrome P450 Isoforms\nRizatriptan is not an inhibitor of the activities of human liver cytochrome P450 isoforms 3A4/5, 1A2, 2C9, 2C19, or 2E1; rizatriptan is a competitive inhibitor (Ki=1400 nM) of cytochrome P450 2D6, but only at high, clinically irrelevant concentrations.\n\n### Special Populations\nGeriatric: Rizatriptan pharmacokinetics in healthy elderly non-migraineur volunteers (age 65-77 years) were similar to those in younger non-migraineur volunteers (age 18-45 years).\nPediatric: The pharmacokinetics of rizatriptan was determined in pediatric migraineurs 6 to 17 years of age. Exposures following single dose administration of 5 mg MAXALT-MLT to pediatric patients weighing 20-39 kg (44-87 lb) or 10 mg MAXALT-MLT to pediatric patients weighing ≥40 kg (88 lb) were similar to those observed following single dose administration of 10 mg MAXALT-MLT to adults.\nGender: The mean AUC0-∞ and Cmax of rizatriptan (10 mg orally) were about 30% and 11% higher in females as compared to males, respectively, while Tmax occurred at approximately the same time.\nHepatic impairment: Following oral administration in patients with hepatic impairment caused by mild to moderate alcoholic cirrhosis of the liver, plasma concentrations of rizatriptan were similar in patients with mild hepatic insufficiency compared to a control group of subjects with normal hepatic function; plasma concentrations of rizatriptan were approximately 30% greater in patients with moderate hepatic insufficiency.\nRenal impairment: In patients with renal impairment (creatinine clearance 10-60 mL/min/1.73 m2), the AUC0-∞ of rizatriptan was not significantly different from that in subjects with normal renal function. In hemodialysis patients, (creatinine clearance <2 mL/min/1.73 m2), however, the AUC for rizatriptan was approximately 44% greater than that in patients with normal renal function.\nRace: Pharmacokinetic data revealed no significant differences between African American and Caucasian subjects.\n\n### Drug Interactions\nMonoamine oxidase inhibitors: Rizatriptan is principally metabolized via monoamine oxidase, 'A' subtype (MAO-A). Plasma concentrations of rizatriptan may be increased by drugs that are selective MAO-A inhibitors (e.g., moclobemide) or nonselective MAO inhibitors  (e.g., isocarboxazid, phenelzine, tranylcypromine, and pargyline). In a drug interaction study, when MAXALT 10 mg was administered to subjects (n=12) receiving concomitant therapy with the selective, reversible MAO-A inhibitor, moclobemide 150 mg t.i.d., there were mean increases in rizatriptan AUC and Cmax of 119% and 41% respectively; and the AUC of the active N-monodesmethyl metabolite of rizatriptan was increased more than 400%. The interaction would be expected to be greater with irreversible MAO inhibitors. No pharmacokinetic interaction is anticipated in patients receiving selective MAO-B inhibitors .\nPropranolol: In a study of concurrent administration of propranolol 240 mg/day and a single dose of rizatriptan 10 mg in healthy adult subjects (n=11), mean plasma AUC for rizatriptan was increased by 70% during propranolol administration, and a four-fold increase was observed in one subject. The AUC of the active N-monodesmethyl metabolite of rizatriptan was not affected by propranolol .\nNadolol/Metoprolol: In a drug interactions study, effects of multiple doses of nadolol 80 mg or metoprolol 100 mg every 12 hours on the pharmacokinetics of a single dose of 10 mg rizatriptan were evaluated in healthy subjects (n=12). No pharmacokinetic interactions were observed.\nParoxetine: In a study of the interaction between the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) paroxetine 20 mg/day for two weeks and a single dose of MAXALT 10 mg in healthy subjects (n=12), neither the plasma concentrations of rizatriptan nor its safety profile were affected by paroxetine .\nOral contraceptives: In a study of concurrent administration of an oral contraceptive during 6 days of administration of MAXALT (10-30 mg/day) in healthy female volunteers (n=18), rizatriptan did not affect plasma concentrations of ethinyl estradiol or norethindrone.", "source": "wikidoc", "question": "According to authoritative guidelines, discuss how rizatriptan’s pharmacokinetic properties and documented drug interactions should influence your prescribing decisions, addressing (with rationale from the guideline) its absorption and bioavailability, primary metabolic pathway (MAO-A) and consequences for concomitant MAO inhibitor use, clinically important interactions (notably propranolol and beta‑blockers), and dosing considerations or monitoring in special populations (pediatric, geriatric, gender differences, hepatic and renal impairment)."}

The most frequently reported adverse events in these studies were nausea and vomiting. These events were generally of mild to moderate severity and usually occurred on the first 2 days of administration. Less than 1% of subjects discontinued prematurely from clinical trials due to nausea and vomiting.\nAdverse events that occurred with an incidence of 1% or greater in 1440 subjects taking placebo or TAMIFLU 75 mg twice daily in adult treatment studies are shown inTable 4. This summary includes 945 healthy young adults and 495 \"at risk\" subjects (elderly patients and patients with chronic cardiac or respiratory disease). Those events reported numerically more frequently in subjects taking TAMIFLU compared with placebo were nausea, vomiting, bronchitis, insomnia, and vertigo.\n\n### Prophylaxis Studies in Adult and Adolescent Subjects (13 years of age and older)\nA total of 4187 subjects (adolescents, healthy adults, and elderly) participated in prophylaxis studies, of whom 1790 received the recommended dose of 75 mg once daily for up to 6 weeks. Adverse events were qualitatively very similar to those seen in the treatment studies, despite a longer duration of dosing (see Table 4). Events reported more frequently in subjects receiving TAMIFLU compared to subjects receiving placebo in prophylaxis studies, and more commonly than in treatment studies, were aches and pains, rhinorrhea, dyspepsia and upper respiratory tract infections. However, the difference in incidence between TAMIFLU and placebo for these events was less than 1%. There were no clinically relevant differences in the safety profile of the 942 elderly subjects who received TAMIFLU or placebo, compared with the younger population.\nAdditional adverse events occurring in less than 1% of patients receiving TAMIFLU for treatment included unstable angina, anemia, pseudomembranous colitis, humerus fracture, pneumonia, pyrexia, and peritonsillar abscess.\n\n### Treatment Studies in Pediatric Subjects (1 to 12 years of age)\nA total of 1032 pediatric subjects aged 1 to 12 years (including 698 otherwise healthy pediatric subjects aged 1 to 12 years and 334 asthmatic pediatric subjects aged 6 to 12 years) participated in controlled clinical trials of TAMIFLU given for the treatment of influenza. A total of 515 pediatric subjects received treatment with TAMIFLU for oral suspension.\nAdverse events occurring in 1% or greater of pediatric subjects receiving TAMIFLU treatment are listed in Table 5. The most frequently reported adverse event was vomiting. Other events reported more frequently by pediatric subjects treated with TAMIFLU included abdominal pain, epistaxis, ear disorder, and conjunctivitis. These events generally occurred once and resolved despite continued dosing resulting in discontinuation of drug in 8 out of 515 (2%) cases.\nThe adverse event profile in adolescents is similar to that described for adult subjects and pediatric subjects aged 1 to 12 years.\n\n### Prophylaxis Studies in Pediatric Subjects (1 to 12 years of age)\nPediatric subjects aged 1 to 12 years participated in a postexposure prophylaxis study in households, both as index cases (n=134) and as contacts (n=222). Gastrointestinal events were the most frequent, particularly vomiting. In a separate 6-week, uncontrolled, pediatric seasonal prophylaxis study (n=49), the adverse events noted were consistent with those previously observed (see Table 5).\n\n### Treatment Studies in Pediatric Subjects (2 weeks to less than 1 year of age)\nAssessment of adverse reactions is based on two open label studies that included safety data on 135 influenza-infected subjects 2 weeks to less than 1 year of age (including premature infants at least 36 weeks post conceptional age) exposed to TAMIFLU at doses ranging from 2 to 3.5 mg/kg twice daily for 5 days. The safety profile was similar across the age range studied, with vomiting, diarrhea and diaper rash being the most frequently reported adverse reactions. The safety profile observed in subjects 2 weeks to less than 1 year of age was consistent with the established safety profile of adults and pediatric subjects older than 1 year of age.\n\n### Prophylaxis Study in Immunocompromised Subjects\nIn a 12-week seasonal prophylaxis study in 475 immunocompromised subjects, including 18 pediatric subjects 1 to 12 years of age, the safety profile in the 238 subjects receiving TAMIFLU was consistent with that previously observed in other TAMIFLU prophylaxis clinical trials.\n\n## Postmarketing Experience\nThe following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of TAMIFLU. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to TAMIFLU exposure.\nBody as a Whole: Swelling of the face or tongue, allergy, anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions, hypothermia\nDermatologic: Rash, dermatitis, urticaria, eczema, toxic epidermal necrolysis, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, erythema multiforme \nDigestive: Hepatitis, liver function tests abnormal\nCardiac: Arrhythmia\nGastrointestinal disorders: Gastrointestinal bleeding, hemorrhagic colitis\nNeurologic: Seizure\nMetabolic: Aggravation of diabetes\nPsychiatric: Abnormal behavior, delirium, including symptoms such as hallucinations, agitation, anxiety, altered level of consciousness, confusion, nightmares, delusions", "source": "wikidoc", "question": "According to authoritative guidelines, discuss how clinicians should counsel, monitor, and manage adverse reactions to oseltamivir across age groups and indications, addressing: (1) the common adverse events and their typical timing and severity from treatment and prophylaxis trials; (2) adverse reactions that are more frequent with prophylaxis versus treatment; (3) serious or rare postmarketing reactions that require urgent recognition and action; (4) age-specific considerations (infants, children, adolescents, adults, elderly, immunocompromised); and (5) criteria or circumstances prompting dose discontinuation, further investigation, or specialist referral."}

NAV-CO2 systems combine Alcohol-based sanitizing solutions with a heated stream of CO2 liquid to create a vapor capable of penetrating small crevices and gaps.

{"guideline_text": "Collagen, type XI, alpha 2\nCollagen alpha-2(XI) chain is a protein that in humans is encoded by the COL11A2 gene.\nThe COL11A2 gene produces one component of this type of collagen, called the pro-alpha2(XI) chain. Type XI collagen adds structure and strength to the tissues that support the body's muscles, joints, organs and skin (the connective tissue). Type XI collagen is normally found in cartilage as well as the fluid that fills the eyeball, the inner ear, and the center portion of the discs between the vertebrae in the spine (nucleus pulposus). Type XI collagen also helps maintain the spacing and diameter of type II collagen fibrils. Type II collagen is an important component of the eye and mature cartilage tissue. The size and arrangement of type II collagen fibrils is essential for the normal structure of these tissues.\nThe pro-alpha2(XI) chain combines with pro-alpha1(XI) and pro-alpha1(II)collagen chains to form a procollagen molecule. These triple-stranded, ropelike procollagen molecules must be processed by enzymes in the cell. Once processed, these procollagen molecules leave the cell and arrange themselves into long, thin fibrils that cross-link to one another in the spaces around cells. The cross-linkages result in the formation of very strong mature type XI collagen fibers.\nThe COL11A2 gene is located on the short (p) arm of chromosome 6 at position 21.3, from base pair 33,238,446 to base pair 33,268,222.\n\n# Function\nThis gene encodes one of the two alpha chains of type XI collagen, a minor fibrillar collagen. It is located on chromosome 6 very close to but separate from the gene for retinoid X receptor beta. Type XI collagen is a heterotrimer but the third alpha chain is a post-translationally modified alpha 1 type II chain. Proteolytic processing of this type XI chain produces PARP, a proline/arginine-rich protein that is an amino terminal domain. Mutations in this gene are associated with type III Stickler syndrome, otospondylomegaepiphyseal dysplasia (OSMED syndrome), Weissenbacher-Zweymuller syndrome, and autosomal dominant nonsyndromic sensorineural 13 deafness. Three transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been identified for this gene.\n\n# Clinical significance\n\n## Nonsyndromic deafness\nMutations in the COL11A2 gene have been shown to cause hearing loss without other signs or symptoms (nonsyndromic deafness autosomal dominant) in two large families. One family carries a mutation that substitutes the amino acid cysteine (a building block of proteins) for the amino acid arginine at position 549 (written as Arg549Cys) in the alpha 2 chain of type XI collagen. A second family has a mutation that substitutes the amino acid glutamic acid for the amino acid glycine at position 323 (written as Gly323Glu) in this protein. These mutations prevent the normal assembly of type XI collagen. Type XI collagen plays an important role in the structure and function of the inner ear. When mutations in the COL11A2 gene affect the structure of collagen fibrils, hearing loss can result.\n\n## Otospondylomegaepiphyseal dysplasia\nApproximately 10 mutations identified in the COL11A2 gene are responsible for otospondylomegaepiphyseal dysplasia (OSMED). Most of these mutations result in a complete lack of pro-alpha2(XI) chains, which leads to a loss of function of type XI collagen. Some mutations affect the production of the pro-alpha2(XI) chain and disrupt normal collagen assembly. Because this type of collagen is an important component of cartilage and other connective tissues, these mutations result in the characteristic signs and symptoms of OSMED.\n\n## Stickler syndrome\nStickler syndrome (COL11A2): Stickler syndrome is a disorder that causes problems with skeletal development, vision, and hearing. Mutations in the COL11A2 gene cause a form of Stickler in which vision is not affected. COL11A2 mutations cause abnormal production of the pro-alpha2(XI) chain, part of type XI collagen. As a result, type XI collagen is impaired and cannot function properly, causing the skeletal and hearing problems characteristic of Stickler syndrome. The pro-alpha2(XI) chain, however, is not made in the eyes. Instead, another type of collagen chain replaces pro-alpha2(XI) to form type XI collagen in the vitreous of the eye. COL11A2 mutations, therefore, do not affect vision.\n\n## Weissenbacher-Zweymüller syndrome\nAt least one identified mutation in the COL11A2 gene is responsible for Weissenbacher-Zweymüller syndrome. This mutation causes the amino acid glycine to be replaced with the amino acid glutamic acid at position 955 in the alpha 2 chain of type XI collagen (written as Gly955Glu). This mutation prevents collagen molecules from being assembled properly, which disrupts the structure of type XI collagen. These changes result in the characteristic signs and symptoms of Weissenbacher-Zweymüller syndrome.\n\n## Vasculitis\nA link has been shown between ANCA-associated vasculitis and SNPs in the COL11A2 gene in a Genomewide Association Study. It is proposed that this association may be due to linkage disequilibrium between a SNP in the HLA-DP locus and SNPs in COL11A2.

They found that mutations in the gene P2RY5 causes a rare, inherited form of hair loss called Hypotrichosis simplex. It is the first receptor in humans known to play a role in hair growth.

{"guideline_text": "ANKRD2\nAnkyrin Repeat, PEST sequence and Proline-rich region (ARPP), also known as Ankyrin repeat domain-containing protein 2 is a protein that in humans is encoded by the ANKRD2 gene. ARPP is a member of the muscle ankyrin repeat proteins (MARP), which also includes CARP and DARP, and is highly expressed in cardiac and skeletal muscle and in other tissues. Expression of AARP has been shown to be altered in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.\n\n# Structure\nTwo isoforms of ARPP have been documented; a 39.8 kDa protein isoform composed of 360 amino acids and a 36.2 kDa protein isoform composed of 327 amino acids. ANKRD2 has nine exons, four of which encode ankyrin repeats in the middle region of the protein, a PEST-like and Lysine-rich sequence in the N-terminal region, and a Proline-rich sequence containing consensus sequences for phosphorylation in the C-terminal region. It has been proposed that AARP can homo- or hetero-dimerize with other MARPs in an antiparallel fashion. ARPP is highly expressed in nuclei and I-bands in slow skeletal fibers and cardiac muscle, specifically in ventricular regions at intercalated discs; and expression in brain, pancreas and esophageal epithelium has also been documented. Though AARP and CARP proteins show significant homology, their expression profiles in muscle cells are markedly different; CARP is expressed throughout atria and ventricles, in development and in adult myocytes, however AARP is almost exclusively ventricular and only in adult myocytes. AARP was also found to be expressed in rhabdomyosarcomas, exhibiting a pattern distinct from actin and desmin.\n\n# Function\nAARP localizes to both nuclei and sarcomeres in muscle cells. ARPP may play a role in the differentiation of myocytes, as ARPP expression was shown to be induced during the C2C12 differentiation in vitro. A role for AARP in regulating muscle gene expression and sensing stress signals was implicated in the finding that AARP colocalizes with the transcriptional co-activator and co-repressor PML in myoblast nuclei, and binds p53 to enhance the p21(WAFI/CIPI) promoter. It was further demonstrated that Nkx2.5 and p53 synergistically activate the ANKRD2 promoter to promote effects on myogenic differentiation. At the sarcomere, AARP binds titin at I-bands, which is potentiated by homo-dimerization and can alter the protein kinase A/protein kinase C phosphorylation status of itself or titin. These studies demonstrate a stretch-responsive relationship between AARP and Titin, which can be rapidly altered by post-translational mechanisms.\nFunctional insights into AARP function have come from transgenic studies. In mice lacking all three muscle ankyrin repeat proteins (MARPs), AARP, CARP, and DARP), skeletal muscles tended towards a more slower fiber type distribution, with longer resting sarcomere length, decreased fiber stiffness, expression of a longer titin isoform, greater degree of torque loss following eccentric contraction-related injury, and enhanced expression of MyoD and MLP. These findings suggest that AARP and related MARP proteins may play a role in the passive stiffness and gene regulatory roles in skeletal muscle. A study investigating AARP function in cardiac muscle in which AARP was knocked out alone or in combination with the other MARPs showed that mice displayed normal cardiac function at baseline and in response to pressure overload-induced cardiac hypertrophy, suggesting that these proteins are not essential for normal cardiac development or in response to a hypertrophic stimulus.\nAARP has also shown to play a role in models of disease. AARP has also exhibited elevated expression following skeletal muscle denervation, persisting for four weeks following the insult. AARP (ANKRD2) gene expression was also shown to be rapidly induced in a model of eccentric contraction-related injury, showing peak expression (6-11 times normal value) within 12–24 hours following injury, suggesting that AARP may play a role in repair. In a mouse model of muscular dystrophy with myositis (mdm) caused by a small deletion in titin, ANKRD2 mRNA expression was shown to be significantly elevated in skeletal muscle tissue along with that of CARP, suggesting a role for AARP in titin-based signaling. Levels of AARP were also altered in a mouse model of diabetes.\n\n# Clinical Significance\nIn patients with dilated cardiomyopathy, levels of AARP were upregulated.\nAARP expression patterns have been shown to be altered in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), with decreased expression in slow skeletal muscle fibers and increased expression in fast skeletal muscle fibers.\nARPP has also been shown to be a potentially useful biomarker for the differential diagnosis between oncocytoma and chromophobe renal cell carcinomas.\nIn non-pathologic physiology, AARP mRNA expression in skeletal muscle of patients was shown to be elevated two days following fatiguing jumping exercises. Levels of CARP, MLP and calpain-2 mRNA levels were also enhanced, suggesting that these molecules may be part of a signaling network activated by physical exercise.\n\n# Interactions\nANKRD2 has been shown to interact with\n- Titin\n- YBX1,\n- TCAP,\n- PML and\n- TP53.\n- Akt,", "source": "wikidoc", "question": "According to the authoritative wikidoc recommendation on ANKRD2 (AARP), discuss how measurement of AARP expression could be used clinically—specifying for which conditions (e.g., dilated cardiomyopathy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, differential diagnosis of renal tumors, exercise-related muscle injury) it might have diagnostic or prognostic value, how changes in expression should be interpreted in light of its cellular localization, functional roles and interactions (e.g., with titin, p53, PML), and what the main limitations and implications for patient management would be."}
{"guideline_text": "Topical anesthetic\nA topical anesthetic is a local anesthetic that is used to numb the surface of a body part. They can be used to numb the front of the eye, the inside of the nose, the throat, the skin, the ear, the anus, and the genital area . Topical anesthetics are available in creams, ointments, aerosols, sprays, lotions, and jellies . Examples include benzocaine, butamben, dibucaine, lidocaine, oxybuprocaine, pramoxine, proparacaine (Alcaine), proxymetacaine, and tetracaine (AKA amethocaine).\n\n# Usage\nTopical anesthetics are used to relieve pain and itching caused by conditions such as sunburn or other minor burns, insect bites or stings, poison ivy, poison oak, poison sumac, and minor cuts and scratches .\nTopical anesthetics are used in ophthalmology in order to numb the surface of the eye (the outermost layers of the cornea and conjunctiva) for the following purposes:\n- In order to perform a contact/applanation tonometry.\n- In order to perform a Schirmer's test (The Schirmer's test is sometimes used with a topical eye anesthetic, sometimes without. The use of a topical anesthetic might impede the reliability of the Schirmer's test and should be avoided if possible.).\n- In order to remove small foreign objects from the uppermost layer of the cornea or conjunctiva. The deeper and the larger a foreign object which should be removed lies within the cornea and the more complicated it is to remove it, the more drops of the topical anesthetic are necessary to be dropped onto the surface of the eye prior to the removal of the foreign object in order to numb the surface of the eye with enough intensity and duration.\nSome topical anesthetics are also used in otolaryngology, like for example oxybuprocaine.\n\n# Duration of topical anesthesia in the eye\nThe duration of topical anesthesia might depend on the type and amount applied, but is usually about half an hour.\n\n# Abuse when used for ocular pain relief\nWhen used excessively, topical anesthetics can cause severe and irreversible damage to corneal tissues and even loss of the eye. The abuse of topical anesthetics often creates challenges for correct diagnosis in that it is a relatively uncommon entity that may initially present as a chronic keratitis masquerading as acanthamoeba keratitis or other infectious keratitis. When a keratitis is unresponsive to treatment and associated with strong ocular pain, topical anesthetic abuse should be considered, and a history of psychiatric disorders and other substance abuse have been implicated as important factors in the diagnosis. Because of the potential for abuse, clinicians have been warned about the possibility of theft and advised against prescribing topical anesthetics for therapeutic purposes.\nSome patients who suffer from eye pain, which is often considerably strong neuropathic pain caused by the irritation of the nerves within the cornea and/or conjunctiva, unfortunately try to illegally obtain oxybuprocaine or other eye anesthetics (for example by stealing them at their ophthalmologist, by forging medical prescriptions or by trying to order it via an online pharmacy) and secretly use the substance to numb their eye pain, often ending up with irreversible corneal damage or even destruction (which is a vicious cycle and causes even much more pain). Often, such patients finally require corneal transplantation.\nIn case of prolonged or chronic eye pain, especially neuropathic eye pain, it is highly advisable to use centrally acting substances like anticonvulsants (pregabalin, gabapentin and in more serious cases carbamazepine) or antidepressants (for example SSRIs or the tricyclic antidepressant amitriptyline). Even very small amounts of an anticonvulsant and/or an antidepressant can almost completely stop eye pain and does not damage the eye at all.\n\n# Notes\n- ↑ Jump up to: 1.0 1.1 1.2 Pharmakakis NM, Katsimpris JM, Melachrinou MP, Koliopoulos JX. \"Corneal complications following abuse of topical anesthetics.\" Eur J Ophthalmol. 2002 Sep-Oct;12(5):373-8.

{"guideline_text": "Inosine\nInosine is a nucleoside that is formed when hypoxanthine is attached to a ribose ring (also known as a ribofuranose) via a β-N9-glycosidic bond.\nInosine is commonly found in tRNAs and is essential for proper translation of the genetic code in wobble base pairs.\nKnowledge of inosine metabolism has led to advances in immunotherapy in recent decades. Inosine monophosphate is oxidised by the enzyme inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase, yielding xanthosine monophosphate, a key precursor in purine metabolism.  Mycophenolate mofetil is an anti-metabolite, anti-proliferative drug that acts as an inhibitor of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase. It is used in the treatment of a variety of autoimmune diseases including granulomatosis with polyangiitis because the uptake of purine by actively dividing B cells can exceed 8 times that of normal body cells, and, therefore, this set of white cells (which cannot operate purine salvage pathways) is selectively targeted by the purine deficiency resulting from Inherited Metabolic Diseases (IMD) inhibition.\n\n# Reactions\nAdenine is converted to adenosine or inosine monophosphate (IMP), either of which, in turn, is converted into inosine (I), which pairs with Adenine (A), cytosine (C), and uracil (U).\nPurine nucleoside phosphorylase intraconverts inosine and hypoxanthine.\nInosine is also an intermediate in a chain of purine nucleotides reactions required for muscle movements.\n\n# Clinical significance\nIt was tried in the 1970s in Eastern countries for improving athletic performance. Nevertheless, the clinical trials for this purpose showed no improvement.\nIt has been shown that inosine has neuroprotective properties. It has been proposed for spinal cord injury; because it improves axonal rewiring, and for administration after stroke, because observation has shown that axonal re-wiring is encouraged.\nAfter ingestion, inosine produces uric acid that is suggested to be a natural antioxidant and a peroxynitrite scavenger with potential benefits to patients with multiple sclerosis (MS.) Peroxynitrite has been correlated with axon degeneration . In 2003, a study was initiated at the University of Pennsylvania MS Center to determine whether raising the levels of uric acid by the administration of inosine would slow the progression of MS. The study was completed in 2006 but the results were not reported to NIH. A subsequent publication hinted at potential benefits but the sample size (16 patients) was too small for a definitive conclusion. In addition, the side effect of the treatment was the development of kidney stones in 4 out of 16 patients. Thus, additional studies are necessary to prove the treatment's efficacy.\nIt is also in phase II trials for Parkinson's disease. Earlier trials had suggested those with the highest serum urate levels had lower progression of Parkinson's symptoms. The trial uses inosine to raise urate levels in those with levels lower than the population mean (6 mg/dL).\nAlseres Pharmaceuticals (named Boston Life Sciences when patent was granted) patented the treatment for stroke  and is currently investigating the drug in the MS setting.\nIn the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Classification System, it is classified as an antiviral.\n\n# Biotechnology\nWhen designing primers for polymerase chain reaction, inosine is useful in that it can pair with adenine, thymine, or cytosine.  This allows for design of primers that span a single-nucleotide polymorphism, without the polymorphism disrupting the primer's annealing efficiency.\nHowever, inosine pairs preferentially with cytidine (C) and its introduction to RNA, e.g. by the action of ADARs, thereby destabilizes double stranded RNA by changing AU base-pairs to\nIU mismatches (Bass and Weintraub, Cell, 1988).\n\n# Fitness\nDespite  lack of clinical evidence that it improves muscle development, inosine remains an ingredient in some fitness supplements.\n\n# Feeding Stimulant\nInosine has also been found to be an important feed stimulant by itself or in combination with certain amino acids in some species of farmed fish. For example, inosine and inosine-5-monophosphate have been reported as specific feeding stimulants for turbot fry, (Scophthalmus maximus)  and Japanese amberjack, (Seriola quinqueradiata). The main problem of using inosine and/or inosine-5-monophosphate as feeding attractants is their high cost. However, their use may be economically justified within larval feeds for marine fish larvae during the early weaning period, since the total quantity of feed consumed is relatively low.", "source": "wikidoc", "question": "According to authoritative guidelines, discuss the proposed mechanisms of action, the quality of clinical evidence, key safety concerns (including adverse events), and the practical implications for clinicians considering inosine therapy or recommending inosine supplements for neurological conditions such as multiple sclerosis, Parkinson’s disease, stroke, or spinal cord injury."}
{"guideline_text": "Tucatinib with trastuzumab and capecitabine for treating HER2-positive advanced breast cancer after 2 or more anti-HER2 therapies\n\nEvidence-based recommendations on tucatinib (TUKYSA) for HER2‑positive locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer in adults after 2 or more anti‑HER2 treatment therapies.\n\n# Recommendations\nTucatinib with trastuzumab and capecitabine is recommended, within its marketing authorisation, as an option for treating HER2‑positive locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer in adults after 2 or more anti‑HER2 treatment therapies, only if the company provides tucatinib according to the commercial arrangement.\nWhy the committee made these recommendations\nCurrent treatment for HER2‑positive locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer after 2 or more anti‑HER2 regimens is chemotherapy. Tucatinib with trastuzumab and capecitabine (tucatinib combination) is another anti‑HER2 therapy that could be used after 2 or more anti‑HER2 regimens. Trastuzumab can be given subcutaneously or intravenously, but the subcutaneous injection is easier to administer.\nClinical trial evidence shows that tucatinib combination increases the time people have before their cancer gets worse and how long they live compared with trastuzumab with capecitabine. But trastuzumab with capecitabine is not standard care in the NHS. Comparing tucatinib combination indirectly with chemotherapy suggests it may increase the time people have before their cancer gets worse and how long they live. It is likely that tucatinib combination improves people's quality of life before and after their cancer gets worse compared with chemotherapy.\nThe economic model does not take into account all of the benefits of tucatinib combination, particularly for people with brain metastases. Taking this into account, the cost-effectiveness estimates for tucatinib combination are likely to be within what NICE normally considers an acceptable use of NHS resources. So, tucatinib combination is recommended.# Information about tucatinib\n\n# Marketing authorisation indication\nTucatinib (TUKYSA, Seagen UK) has a marketing authorisation for use 'in combination with trastuzumab and capecitabine for the treatment of adult patients with HER2-positive locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer who have received at least 2 prior anti-HER2 treatment regimens'.\n\n# Dosage in the marketing authorisation\nThe dosage schedule is available in the summary of product characteristics for tucatinib.\n\n# Price\nThe list price is £5,636.84 per 84 pack of 150 mg film-coated tablets (excluding VAT; BNF online accessed February 2022). The average cost of a course of combination treatment at list price is £7,016.91 for the loading dose and £6,677.14 for the following cycles (company submission).\nThe company has a commercial arrangement. This makes tucatinib available to the NHS with a discount. The size of the discount is commercial in confidence. It is the company's responsibility to let relevant NHS organisations know details of the discount.# Committee discussion\nThe appraisal committee considered evidence submitted by Seagen UK, a review of this submission by the evidence review group (ERG), responses from stakeholders and comments on the first appraisal consultation document. See the committee papers for full details of the evidence.\nThe committee discussed the following issues.\n\n# Clinical need and treatment pathway\n\n## HER2-positive breast cancer has a high disease burden\nSome breast cancer cells have higher levels of a protein called HER2 on their surface, which stimulates them to grow. This is known as HER2‑positive breast cancer. Around 1 in 5 breast cancers are HER2‑positive. Patient experts explained that being diagnosed with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer is extremely difficult for people and their family and friends. It can cause considerable anxiety and fear, with the uncertainty being the hardest part for many people. These feelings can negatively affect mental health. People with metastatic breast cancer must organise their lives around hospital appointments, which constrains their everyday activities. Brain metastases may develop in up to half of people with HER2‑positive cancer, which negatively affects people's prognosis and quality of life. The patient experts explained they were not able to drive or work, and lost their independence. The committee concluded that there is a high disease burden for people with HER2‑positive metastatic breast cancer, especially for those with brain metastases.\n\n## There is a need for anti-HER2 therapies after second-line treatment, especially for people with brain metastases\nThere is no cure for metastatic breast cancer. Treatment aims to stop progression of the disease, extend life, and maintain or improve quality of life for as long as possible. Treatment is continued for as long as it works. First-line treatment of HER2‑positive metastatic breast cancer includes the anti‑HER2 therapies pertuzumab with trastuzumab and docetaxel, or trastuzumab with paclitaxel (see NICE's technology appraisal guidance on pertuzumab with trastuzumab and docetaxel for treating HER2-positive breast cancer and trastuzumab for treating advanced breast cancer). Trastuzumab emtansine is an anti‑HER2 therapy used at second line (see NICE's technology appraisal guidance on trastuzumab emtansine for treating HER2-positive advanced breast cancer after trastuzumab and a taxane; from now referred to as TA458). Clinical experts explained that HER2‑positive metastatic breast cancer that has progressed after 2 or more anti‑HER2 regimens has a high symptom burden and is resistant to previous lines of therapy. The committee noted that, although some NHS trusts may offer third-line anti‑HER2 therapy, it is not available across the NHS and cannot be considered standard care. Trastuzumab deruxtecan is only available through the Cancer Drugs Fund so is not considered standard care (see NICE's technology appraisal guidance on trastuzumab deruxtecan for treating HER2-positive unresectable or metastatic breast cancer after 2 or more anti-HER2 therapies; from now referred to as TA704). Instead, standard care for people whose disease has progressed on or after 2 anti‑HER2 therapies is non-targeted chemotherapy, including capecitabine, vinorelbine or eribulin (see NICE's guideline on advanced breast cancer: diagnosis and treatment  and NICE's technology appraisal guidance on eribulin for treating locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer after 2 or more chemotherapy regimens, from now referred to as TA423). Brain metastases can be treated with stereotactic radiosurgery or radiotherapy (see NICE's guideline on brain tumours and metastases in over 16s). The clinical experts explained that there is a limit to the number of these treatments, and most people cannot have more than 2 courses of radiotherapy because of its neurological toxicity. Currently there are no further treatment options that target brain metastases because most chemotherapy treatments have very limited capacity to cross from the blood into the brain. The committee concluded that there is a high unmet need for anti‑HER2 treatment after second-line anti-HER2 treatment. This is particularly important for the significant proportion of people who have brain metastases, because tucatinib can cross an intact blood-brain barrier and treat brain metastases.\n\n## The relevant comparators are capecitabine, vinorelbine and eribulin\nIn its initial submission, the company used eribulin as its base-case comparator. It stated that eribulin is the only third-line treatment approved by NICE for HER2‑positive locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer and has clinical equivalence to capecitabine and vinorelbine. The ERG noted that CG81 recommends that people may also have treatment with other non‑HER2‑targeted chemotherapies such as capecitabine or vinorelbine. The clinical experts confirmed that current NHS third-line standard care is non-targeted chemotherapy, including capecitabine, vinorelbine or eribulin. The clinical experts explained that although some people have trastuzumab with capecitabine, there is wide regional variation in its availability. As it is not available to all patients in the NHS, the committee agreed that trastuzumab with capecitabine is not a relevant comparator. The committee concluded that the relevant comparators for tucatinib with trastuzumab and capecitabine (from now referred to as tucatinib combination) are capecitabine, vinorelbine and eribulin.\n\n# Clinical evidence\n\n## The HER2CLIMB population is generalisable to UK clinical practice\nThe clinical evidence was based on HER2CLIMB, a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, active comparator trial for HER2‑positive locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer previously treated with trastuzumab, pertuzumab and trastuzumab emtansine. Approximately 50% of people in HER2CLIMB had brain metastases. The clinical experts explained that HER2CLIMB represents patients in the NHS in terms of characteristics and previous treatment, including the proportion of people who will go on to develop brain metastases. The committee concluded that the population in HER2CLIMB was generalisable to the eligible population in clinical practice in the UK.\n\n## Tucatinib combination is more effective than trastuzumab with capecitabine, but this comparison does not reflect NHS practice\nHER2CLIMB assessed tucatinib combination compared with placebo plus trastuzumab and capecitabine (from now referred to as placebo combination). However, trastuzumab with capecitabine is not used in NHS practice (see section 3.3). People who had tucatinib combination had a median progression-free survival of 7.8 months compared with 5.6 months for people who had placebo combination. The hazard ratio for disease progression or death was 0.54 (95% confidence interval , 0.42 to 0.71; p<0.001). People who had tucatinib combination had a median overall survival of 21.9 months compared with 17.4 months for people who had placebo combination. The hazard ratio for death was 0.66 (95% CI, 0.50 to 0.88; p=0.005). An improvement in progression-free and overall survival was observed in people with and without brain metastases. The clinical experts explained that this is because, unlike existing treatments, tucatinib is a small molecule that can pass through an intact blood-brain barrier. The clinical experts also explained that the clinical data in the company submission was supported by some longer follow-up data from the trial, which was presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology annual meeting. The committee concluded that tucatinib combination is more effective than trastuzumab with capecitabine, but that this comparison does not reflect NHS practice. The committee also noted that the impact on brain metastases is important because brain metastases are associated with a poor prognosis and reduced quality of life (see section 3.1 and section 3.2).\n\n# Indirect treatment comparison\n\n## Results of the network meta-analysis are uncertain because of heterogeneity across trials\nThere was no head-to-head evidence comparing tucatinib combination against the relevant comparators, capecitabine, vinorelbine or eribulin (see section 3.3). Therefore, the company did a network meta-analysis to allow for an indirect treatment comparison. The results showed increased progression-free and overall survival for tucatinib combination compared with other treatments (the exact numbers are academic in confidence and cannot be reported here). However, the ERG explained that these results are uncertain because there were differences between patient populations in the trials included. The HER2CLIMB trial included people with and without brain metastases. Approximately 29% had active brain metastases (that is, either treated and progressing, or untreated) and 19% had stable brain metastases. None of the comparator trials included people with active brain metastases. All but one included people with stable or inactive brain metastases, but the proportion was usually not reported or was lower than in HER2CLIMB (see section 3.8 and section 3.9 for further discussion of brain metastases). Other differences between patient populations were the number of previous therapies, prior anti‑HER2 treatment, HER2 positivity status, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status and family background. The committee concluded that tucatinib is likely to improve clinical outcomes relative to eribulin, capecitabine and vinorelbine, but the size of the effect is uncertain. This is because there was clinical heterogeneity in several areas, particularly that people with active brain metastases were included in the HER2CLIMB trial but not in the other trials.\n\n## A random effects model is appropriate because of heterogeneity in the network, but does not account for systematic differences between trials\nIn its initial submission, the company used a fixed effects model for the network meta-analysis. This was because random effects modelling had limitations such as convergence issues and a higher degree of uncertainty. The ERG used a random effects model, explaining that it better accounted for heterogeneity in the network meta-analysis and is preferred to fixed effects modelling, despite its limitations. The company agreed with the ERG's approach in its response to consultation and updated its base case accordingly. The committee noted that the results from using the 2 methods were similar, although the random effects model gave wider confidence intervals. The committee concluded that the random effects methodology was more appropriate because of heterogeneity in the network, and acknowledged it was used by the company in its updated base case. However, it noted that using a random effects model did not account for any systematic bias in the network related to differences in the proportions of people with brain metastases.\n\n## Network meta-analysis results should be adjusted for a treatment-modifying effect of brain metastases\nThe clinical experts explained that people with brain metastases have a poorer prognosis than those without. The committee noted that an anchored indirect treatment comparison can account for differences in prognostic factors between trials, but only if they have no effect on relative treatment outcomes (that is, they are not treatment effect modifiers). The clinical experts explained that tucatinib is the only treatment shown to cross the blood-brain barrier with demonstrated activity in brain metastases. But they highlighted that the impact of other treatment options on brain metastases is complex. Although comparator drugs generally cannot cross an intact blood-brain barrier, small amounts can cross when the barrier is compromised, for example, after whole-brain radiation therapy. The clinical experts also noted that good control of disease and metastases in other parts of the body may delay the time to developing brain metastases or them reoccurring. This means that treatments that are more effective in controlling other metastases, such as trastuzumab with capecitabine, are also believed to be more effective for people with brain metastases compared with single-agent non-targeted chemotherapy. They also noted that lapatinib with capecitabine (not a relevant comparator but included in the network) was shown to have at least some activity for brain metastases. The committee understood that the network meta-analysis results may be biased because the presence of brain metastases may affect how well comparator treatments work for people with breast cancer. That is, had people with active brain metastases been included in the comparator trials, the outcomes would be expected to be worse. In its response to consultation, the company presented the results of a literature review suggesting that the trastuzumab component alone in both arms of the HER2CLIMB trial may give a survival benefit in people with brain metastases compared with no treatment or non‑HER2‑targeted therapy. Therefore, the non-tucatinib control arm in the trial may itself have had better outcomes than the 3 individual non‑HER2‑targeted therapies considered as comparators in this appraisal. However, the company acknowledged this represents a naive comparison between different populations in different studies. The committee concluded that the network meta-analysis results could be adjusted for a treatment-modifying effect of brain metastases. It noted that this analysis is still likely to be highly uncertain, but nevertheless useful for decision making (see section 3.9).\n\n## Adjustment based on HER2CLIMB data is preferred, but may be conservative\nThe company used 2 approaches to estimate how much worse outcomes would have been if the same proportion of people with brain metastases as in HER2CLIMB had been included in the comparator monotherapy trials.\nIn its preferred approach, the company asked 10 clinicians to estimate overall survival at 1, 2, 3 and 5 years for single-agent chemotherapies if their respective trials had included the same proportion of people with brain metastases as HER2CLIMB. These estimates were lower than predicted by the ERG model (see section 3.11). Comparing the 2 sets of estimates, the company calculated by how much the network meta-analysis results would need to be adjusted to align with the survival predictions given by clinicians.\nIn the alternative approach, the company used individual patient data from HER2CLIMB to estimate a treatment-modifying effect of brain metastases.The ERG noted that the company's preferred approach (using clinician estimates) resulted in an upward kink in the survival estimates at year 2, which was unrealistic. It preferred the alternative, data-driven approach, using HER2CLIMB data. The company explained that the upward kink in survival estimates was because it relied on clinician predictions at specific timepoints, without smoothing out between these timepoints. However, it noted that if it had done so, the cost-effectiveness estimates would decrease slightly. The company explained that the approach using the HER2CLIMB data did not capture any additional treatment effect from HER2‑targeted therapy (trastuzumab) in the placebo arm of the trial. The ERG recognised that its approach may be conservative. The committee noted that neither approach was robust. There was uncertainty about how much the comparator arms should be adjusted to account for the discrepancy in the proportion of people with brain metastases. However, despite its limitations, the committee's preference was for the HER2CLIMB data-driven approach, over the clinician's estimations. It concluded that this approach did not account for any benefit from trastuzumab and may be conservative, and acknowledged that the true cost-effectiveness estimates are likely to be lower than those estimated using the data-driven approach.\n\n# Cost-effectiveness evidence\n\n## The company's economic model is suitable for decision making\nThe company submitted a partitioned survival model to estimate the cost effectiveness of tucatinib combination compared with eribulin, capecitabine and vinorelbine. It had 3 health states: progression-free, progressed, and death. The committee considered that the partitioned survival model is a standard approach to estimate the cost effectiveness of cancer drugs and is suitable for decision making.\n\n## Directly extrapolating HER2CLIMB data is most appropriate for estimating progression-free and overall survival for tucatinib and the comparators\nIn its initial submission, the company chose lapatinib with capecitabine as a reference treatment to model progression-free and overall survival, because this was the most commonly used treatment in the network meta-analysis. It explained that lapatinib with capecitabine data was generated using an average of the evidence in the network. It used fractional polynomial curves to extrapolate survival data for the reference arm. It then used hazard ratios from its network meta-analysis to estimate survival for other treatments. The ERG explained that the company approach resulted in estimated survival data for tucatinib combination that had a poor visual fit to data from the HER2CLIMB trial, particularly for overall survival. Instead, it preferred to fit survival curves directly to the HER2CLIMB data using trastuzumab with capecitabine as the reference treatment. It chose the Weibull curve because it provided better visual fit and the best statistical fit. The company explained the ERG's approach created bias against tucatinib because HER2CLIMB included more people with brain metastases than the comparator trials (see section 3.6), and because these people have poorer outcomes than people without brain metastases (see section 3.8). The committee noted that because the HER2CLIMB population was representative of that in clinical practice (see section 3.4), while the populations of other trials were not, it should be used to model survival that would be expected in NHS practice. It also noted that lapatinib with capecitabine is not a relevant comparator in this appraisal (see section 3.3). The committee agreed that the curves fitted to the HER2CLIMB data better fitted the outcomes observed in the trial and more closely matched the clinical expert estimates of progression-free survival and overall survival. However, it acknowledged that this did not address the underlying issues with the network meta-analysis (see sections 3.6 to 3.9). In its response to consultation, the company agreed with the ERG approach. It updated its base case to directly extrapolate HER2CLIMB data for progression-free and overall survival for trastuzumab with capecitabine. It applied hazard ratios from its network meta-analysis, adjusted for the treatment-modifying effect of brain metastases, to estimate survival for the other treatments. The committee acknowledged that the revised company approach aligned with its preference to directly extrapolate survival data from the HER2CLIMB trial.\n\n## The subgroup analyses have methodological limitations and are not appropriate for decision making\nThe company did not model the cost effectiveness of tucatinib combination relative to its comparators separately for people with and without brain metastases because there was limited evidence on the efficacy of comparators in people with brain metastases. The ERG agreed that there was a lack of evidence for the comparators in people with brain metastases. The committee noted that the subgroup of people without brain metastases from HER2CLIMB better corresponded to the patient populations in the other trials included in the network meta-analysis (see section 3.6). It considered that modelling survival for tucatinib combination and its comparators separately for people with and without brain metastases could help to better understand the uncertainty in the cost effectiveness of tucatinib. This is because the presence of brain metastases may be a prognostic factor and have a treatment-modifying effect. So, the shape and extrapolation of survival curves would be likely to differ for people with and without brain metastases (see sections 3.6 to 3.9). In response to consultation, the company did a subgroup analysis for people with brain metastases, by directly extrapolating progression-free and overall survival data from the corresponding HER2CLIMB subgroup. It stated that this analysis showed that tucatinib combination is more cost effective in people with brain metastases than in those without brain metastases. However, it cautioned that the HER2CLIMB trial was not powered to show a significant benefit in overall survival in subgroups. The ERG noted that the company did not provide sufficient information on how the analysis was done and was unable to replicate the company's results. In particular, the company did not justify its selection of survival extrapolation curves, nor did it explore alternative survival extrapolations, so it was unclear if the method it chose was appropriate. The ERG ran exploratory analyses using the same assumptions as the company, and the results were generally aligned with the company estimates. The company further stated that it was not able to do subgroup analyses for people without brain metastases because of time constraints. Instead, it used a weighted average approach to estimate cost effectiveness in this subgroup. The ERG explained these estimates were not accurate because the survival curves were likely to differ between the 2 subgroups, which was not explored. It also explained that incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) are ratios and cannot be directly used to estimate weighted averages. Instead, weighted averages of the total costs and total quality-adjusted life years would need to be estimated and used to calculate the ICER for the non-brain-metastases subgroup. It also noted that the results did not account for the cost of screening people for brain metastases. The committee concluded that the subgroup analyses had methodological limitations and were not described in sufficient detail for adequate scrutiny. Therefore, it concluded that the subgroup analyses were not appropriate for decision making.\n\n## Differences in health state utilities before progression are plausible, but the exact values are uncertain\nFor tucatinib combination, the company used EQ‑5D‑5L health-related quality of life data collected in HER2CLIMB, mapped to the EQ‑5D‑3L with UK preference weighting. Utilities for the comparator therapies were from TA423. This resulted in higher utility values for tucatinib combination compared with comparators in both pre- and post-progression health states. The company explained that tucatinib has better efficacy and safety profiles than eribulin or vinorelbine. It noted that in TA423, eribulin had higher pre-progression utilities than other single-agent chemotherapies. The ERG explained the company approach was inappropriate because the differences in utilities between tucatinib and comparators were not based on comparative evidence. It preferred to use the same utility values for all treatments for each health state, and to derive them all from HER2CLIMB data. The ERG noted that in the HER2CLIMB trial, there was no difference in utility values between the 2 trial arms. The clinical experts explained that the safety profile of tucatinib is good, but it is difficult to separate the effects on quality of life of disease progression and toxicity. The clinical experts also noted that disease control could support different pre-progression utility values because treatments offer different levels of overall response rate. The committee concluded that different pre-progression utility values are plausible, but noted the values used by the company were not evidence based, so were uncertain.\n\n## Differences in health state utilities after progression are plausible, but their extent is probably overestimated\nIn addition to the limitations of the company's approach highlighted in section 3.13, the ERG explained that the utility value used by the company was not accepted by the TA423 committee because it was too low. In response to consultation, the company corrected its post-progression utility value to align with the value the committee agreed on in TA423. It also provided a literature review and results of a survey with clinicians to support differences in post-progression utilities between tucatinib combination, HER2‑directed therapies, and standard single-agent chemotherapy. The ERG explained that the company's justification was reasonable, but it still had concerns about using different sources for post-progression utilities for different treatments. It noted that this resulted in large differences in post-progression utilities for tucatinib combination and the comparators, which may have overestimated the benefit of tucatinib combination. The clinical experts explained that:\nBrain metastases affect people's quality of life to a greater extent than metastases to other organs. So, it is likely that if it takes longer for the disease to progress because of brain metastases, someone's quality of life after progression will be better than if the disease had progressed quickly.\nPeople with disease that is better controlled would have better quality of life before and after progression than those with disease that is less well controlled. This is because the decline in quality of life related to progression will start from a higher level than in people with disease that is less well controlled and with lower quality of life before progression.\nSome toxic effects of chemotherapy can be long lasting and affect a person's quality of life after progression.The committee noted that:\nDifferences in quality of life after progression between tucatinib combination and comparators were plausible. However, it noted that this difference may decrease once people's disease (and therefore quality of life) deteriorates further with time after progression on tucatinib combination.\nThe toxicity of capecitabine on its own is expected to be similar or lower than the toxicity of tucatinib combination. Therefore, differences in toxicity may not explain the large difference in utilities after disease progression between capecitabine and tucatinib combination.\nThe company's approach was not methodologically robust because it used utility values from 2 different sources: the HER2CLIMB trial for tucatinib combination and TA423 for the comparators, in a 'naive comparison', that is, without adjusting for any differences between populations in these sources that might have affected the utility values. It also noted that the value from TA423 was based on the midpoint of 2 utility estimates from 2 different studies. Therefore, the results from the company's approach were uncertain.\nThe company's approach may overestimate the extent of difference in post-progression utilities between tucatinib and comparators, so it may overestimate the benefit of tucatinib combination.\nThe alternative approach of assuming equal post-progression utility after tucatinib and single-agent chemotherapy is most likely pessimistic.The committee concluded that some differences in post-progression health state utilities are plausible, but uncertain. Although the ERG incorporated the company's revised utilities in its base case, the committee remained concerned that if the difference in post-progression utility was overestimated, the cost-effectiveness estimates would be slightly higher than those estimated by the company. It noted that in future it would prefer evidence-based utilities and additional scenarios to be explored.\n\n## Standard NHS practice is subcutaneous trastuzumab\nIn HER2CLIMB, trastuzumab (as part of tucatinib combination) was administered either intravenously or subcutaneously, as allowed for in tucatinib's summary of product characteristics. But the initial company model assumed only intravenous administration of trastuzumab. The clinical experts explained that intravenous trastuzumab is no longer standard NHS practice. The clinical and patient experts explained that subcutaneous administration is preferred because people can self-administer, avoiding unnecessary hospital visits. Both the clinical and patient experts explained that if subcutaneous administration was not possible, they would accept intravenous administration if it meant people could have tucatinib combination. In its response to consultation, the company presented scenario analyses assuming different levels of subcutaneous trastuzumab usage. The ERG provided an additional scenario analysis assuming 100% use of subcutaneous trastuzumab. The Cancer Drugs Fund clinical lead explained that over 90% of patients have trastuzumab subcutaneously in the NHS. Some people may choose to have intravenous trastuzumab if subcutaneous administration is not appropriate for them. He also noted that chemotherapy units have capacity issues with intravenous administration. The clinical experts noted that there are additional benefits from subcutaneous administration that have not been captured in the current modelling, such as fewer hospital visits, and convenience and quality-of-life benefits for patients. Fewer hospital visits may also help reduce COVID‑19 transmission. The committee concluded that subcutaneous trastuzumab is standard care in the NHS and could have unaccounted-for benefits for patients and service delivery.\n\n## Drug wastage should be included in the analysis\nIn its initial submission, the company did not include drug wastage for intravenous trastuzumab in its base case because it is packaged in multi-use vials. The ERG preferred to include this because some wastage is expected in clinical practice. It noted this has a very small effect on overall costs and the cost-effectiveness estimates. It also noted that this applied to intravenous administration only and was not relevant for analyses assuming subcutaneous administration of trastuzumab. The company agreed with the ERG in its response to consultation and updated its base case accordingly. The committee concluded that drug wastage should be included in the analysis and acknowledged this was done appropriately by the company in its revised base case.\n\n# End of life\n\n## Tucatinib combination meets the end of life criteria\nThe committee considered the advice about life-extending treatments for people with a short life expectancy in NICE's guide to the methods of technology appraisal. The clinical experts and the ERG agreed that the life expectancy for people with HER2‑positive locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer having third-line treatment is less than 24 months. They also agreed that the gain in life expectancy with tucatinib combination is expected to be greater than 3 months. The committee also noted that the end of life criteria were accepted in TA423 and TA704 in a third-line setting, and in TA458 in a second-line setting. The committee concluded that tucatinib meets the end of life criteria.\n\n# Cost-effectiveness results\n\n## Tucatinib with trastuzumab and capecitabine is likely to be cost effective\nBecause of confidential commercial arrangements for tucatinib, trastuzumab, eribulin and post-progression therapies, the ICERs cannot be reported here. The company addressed a number of the committee's concerns in its response to consultation, including:\nusing a random effects network meta-analysis (see section 3.7)\nexploring a treatment-modifying effect of brain metastases (see section 3.8 and section 3.9)\nextrapolating progression-free and overall survival directly from HER2CLIMB data ('within-trial' approach; see section 3.11)\nassuming different pre-progression utility values for tucatinib and its comparators (see section 3.13)\njustifying differences in post-progression utility values for tucatinib and its comparators (see section 3.14)\nadjusting utility values for ageing\nincluding drug wastage for trastuzumab and capecitabine (see section 3.16).However, the committee noted that the company's updated base case was not fully aligned with its preferences and instead considered ERG scenarios in its decision making that:\nused HER2CLIMB data to derive a treatment-modifying effect for tucatinib combination (see section 3.9)\nassumed 100% subcutaneous administration of trastuzumab (see section 3.15)\nassumed different post-progression utility values for tucatinib combination or assumed the same post-progression utility values for tucatinib combination (see section 3.14).Taking into account all of the confidential discounts, the committee concluded that, compared with chemotherapy, the cost-effectiveness estimates for tucatinib combination are likely to be within the range that NICE considers a cost-effective use of NHS resources.\n\n# Innovation\n\n## Tucatinib has a novel mechanism of action and not all of its benefits are captured in the model\nThe company and the clinical and patient experts considered tucatinib combination to be innovative. They explained this is because of its improved efficacy and tolerability in people with HER2‑positive metastatic breast cancer, including those with brain metastases, which are common at this stage of disease. The committee agreed that tucatinib combination has significant potential benefits. It acknowledged that not all of the potential benefits in relation to its effect on brain metastases were captured in the analyses (see section 3.9).\n\n# Conclusion\n\n## Tucatinib with trastuzumab and capecitabine is recommended for routine use\nHaving concluded that tucatinib combination is likely to be a cost-effective use of NHS resources, the committee recommended it for routine use.", "source": "nice", "question": "According to authoritative NICE guidance, discuss the clinical and economic considerations that should guide offering tucatinib with trastuzumab and capecitabine to an adult with HER2‑positive locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer after two or more prior anti‑HER2 regimens, including patient selection (prior therapies and the significance of brain metastases), the relevant comparators and why, the key strengths and uncertainties in the clinical evidence (HER2CLIMB and indirect comparisons, treatment‑modifying effects of brain metastases), assumptions affecting cost‑effectiveness (survival extrapolation, health‑state utilities, trastuzumab route and drug wastage), and the implications of the company’s commercial arrangement for NHS availability."}
{"guideline_text": "General anaesthesia\n\n# Overview\nIn modern medical practice, general anaesthesia (AmE: anesthesia) is a state of total unconsciousness resulting from general anaesthetic drugs. A variety of drugs are given to the patient that have different effects with the overall aim of ensuring unconsciousness, amnesia and analgesia. The anaesthetist (AmE: anesthesiologist) selects the optimal technique for any given patient and procedure.\nGeneral anaesthesia is a complex procedure involving:\n- Preanaesthetic assessment\n- Administration of general anaesthetic drugs\n- Cardiorespiratory monitoring\n- Analgesia\n- Airway management\n- Fluid management\n- Postoperative pain relief\n\n# Preanaesthetic evaluation\nPrior to surgery, the anaesthetist interviews the patient to determine the best combination and drugs and dosages and the degree of how much monitoring is required to ensure a safe and effective procedure.\nPertinent information is the  patient's age, weight, medical history, current medications, previous anaesthetics, and fasting time.  Usually, the patients are required to fill out this information on a separate form during the pre-operative evaluation.  Depending on the existing medical conditions reported, the anaesthetist will review this information with the patient either during his pre-operative evaluation or on the day of his or her surgery.\nTruthful and accurate answering of the questions is important so the anaesthetist can select the proper anaesthetics. For instance, a heavy drinker or drug user who does not disclose their chemical uses could be undermedicated, which could then lead to anesthesia awareness or dangerously high blood pressure.  Commonly used medications such as Viagra can interact with anaesthesia drugs; failure to disclose such usage can endanger the patient.\nAn important aspect of this assessment is that of the patient's airway, involving inspection of the mouth opening and visualisation of the soft tissues of the pharynx. The condition of teeth and location of dental crowns and caps are checked, neck flexibility and head extension observed. If an endotracheal tube is indicated and airway management is deemed difficult, then alternative placement methods such as fiberoptic intubation may be used.\n\n# Stages of anaesthesia\n\n## Stage 1\nStage 1 anaesthesia, also known as the \"induction,\" is the period between the initial administration of the induction medications and loss of consciousness. During this stage the patient progresses from analgesia without amnesia to analgesia with amnesia. Patients can carry on a conversation at the time.\n\n## Stage 2\nStage 2 anesthesia, also known as the \"excitement stage,\" is the period following loss of consciousness and marked by excited and delirious activity. During this stage, respirations and heart rate may become irregular. In addition, there may be uncontrolled movements, vomiting, breath holding, and pupillary dilation. Since the combination of spastic movements, vomiting, and irregular respirations may lead to airway compromise, rapidly acting drugs are used to minimize time in this stage and reach stage 3 as fast as possible.\n\n## Stage 3\nStage Three: Surgical Anesthesia. During this stage, the skeletal muscles relax, and the patient's breathing becomes regular. The gag reflex and corneal reflex are lost. Eye movements slow, then stop, and surgery can begin.\n\n## Stage 4\nStage 4 anaesthesia, also known as \"overdose,\" is the stage where too much medication has been given and the patient has severe brain stem or medullary depression.  This results in a cessation of respiration and potential cardiovascular collapse. This stage is lethal without cardiovascular and respiratory support.\n\n# Postoperative Analgesia\nThe anaesthesia concludes with a management plan for postoperative pain relief. This may be in the form of regional analgesia, oral, transdermal or parenteral medication. Minor surgical procedures are amenable to oral pain relief medications such as paracetamol and NSAIDS such as ibuprofen. Moderate levels of pain require the addition of mild opiates such as codeine.\nMajor surgical procedures may require a combination of modalities to confer adequate pain relief. Parenteral methods include Patient Controlled Analgesia System (PCAS) involving morphine, a strong opiate. Here, the patient presses  a button to activate a pump containing morphine. This administers a preset dose of the drug. As the pump is programmed not to exceed a safe amount of the drug, the patient cannot self administer a toxic dose.\n\n# Mortality rates\nOverall, the mortality rate for general anaesthesia is about five deaths per million anaesthetic administrations. Death during anaesthesia is most commonly related to surgical factors or pre-existing medical conditions. These include major haemorrhage, sepsis, and organ failure (eg. heart, lungs, kidneys, liver). Common causes of death directly related to anaesthesia include:\n- aspiration of stomach contents\n- suffocation (due to inadequate airway management)\n- allergic reactions to anaesthesia (specifically and not limited to anti-nausea agents) and other deadly genetic predispositions\n- human error\n- equipment failure\nIn the US, up until about 1980 anesthesia was a significant risk, with at least one death per 10,000 times administered. After becoming something of a public scandal, a careful effort was made to understand the causes and improve the results.  It is generally believed that anesthesia is now at least ten times safer than it was then.  However, there is some controversy about this.  In the US, the data is not made public (in fact, the data is not even collected), so the truth is uncertain.  The rate for dental anesthesia is reported to be one out of 350,000.", "source": "wikidoc", "question": "According to authoritative guidelines on general anaesthesia, outline your perioperative management for an adult patient who is a heavy alcohol user with limited neck extension and poor dentition scheduled for major abdominal surgery, addressing pre‑anaesthetic assessment, airway assessment and anaesthetic induction strategy (including how to minimise time in the “excitement” stage and alternatives for a difficult airway), intraoperative monitoring and fluid/airway management, postoperative analgesia planning for major surgery, and specific measures to reduce anaesthesia‑related mortality."}
{"guideline_text": "Withdrawal of consent\n\n# Overview\nThe official FDA guidelines for sponsors and clinical investigators state:\n\"If a subject withdraws from the interventional portion of the study and does not consent to continued follow-up of associated clinical outcome information, the investigator must not access for purposes related to the study the subject’s medical record or other confidential records requiring the subject’s consent. However an investigator may review study data related to the subject prior to the subject’s withdrawal from the study, and may consult public records, such as those establishing survival status.\"\n\n# Guidance for Sponsors, Clinical Investigators, and IRBs Regarding Data Retention When Subjects Withdraw from FDA-Regulated Clinical Trials\n\"Already-accrued data, relating to individuals who cease participating in a study, are to be maintained as part of the study data. This pertains to data from individuals who decide to discontinue participation in a study, who are withdrawn by their legally authorized representative, as applicable, or who are discontinued from participation by the clinical investigator. This policy is supported by the statutes and regulations administered by FDA as well as ethical and quality standards applicable to clinical research. Maintenance of these records includes, as with all study records, safeguarding the privacy and confidentiality of the subject’s information.\"\n\"A new drug application (NDA) must include a description and analysis of each clinical pharmacology study and controlled clinical study, a description of each uncontrolled trial, and an integrated summary of all available information about the safety of the drug product (21 CFR 314.50(d)(5)) and “copies of individual case report forms for each patient who died during a clinical study or who did not complete the study because of an adverse event, whether believed to be drug related or not, including patients receiving reference drugs or placebo” (21 CFR 314.50(f)(2)).\"\n\"Similarly, an application for premarket approval (PMA) for a device must include “safety and effectiveness data, adverse reactions and complications, patient discontinuation, patient complaints, device failures and replacements, tabulations of data from all individual subject report forms and copies of such forms for each subject who died during a clinical investigation or who did not complete the investigation” (21 CFR 814.20(b)(6)(ii)).\"\n1 USC 360j(g)(2)(B)(ii).\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\nFDA law and regulations require the collection and maintenance of complete clinical study data. This includes information on subjects who withdraw from a clinical investigation, whether the subject decides to discontinue participation in the clinical trial (21 CFR 50.25(a)(8)) or is discontinued by the investigator because the subject no longer qualifies under the protocol (for example, due to a significant adverse event or due to failure to cooperate with study requirements). FDA recognizes that a subject may withdraw from a study; however, the withdrawal does not extend to the data already obtained during the time the subject was enrolled. FDA’s longstanding policy has been that all data collected up to the point of withdrawal must be maintained in the database and included in subsequent analyses, as appropriate.4\nIII. DISCUSSION\nFDA law and regulations recognize that a complete and accurate risk/benefit profile of an investigational product depends upon the data from every subject’s experience in the clinical trial. For example, if a subject’s data could be withdrawn from a study, a sponsor would not have access to data on adverse events experienced by the subject and would be unable to evaluate whether changes to the protocol or the informed consent documents are needed to ensure the rights, safety, and welfare of other trial subjects.5\n4 FDA previously addressed the topic of data withdrawal in the preamble to the 1996 final rule providing an exception from informed consent requirements for emergency research, 21 CFR 50.24. In response to a comment that a subject’s legally authorized representative should be allowed to prevent the review of the subject’s data, FDA stated: “FDA regulations (see, for example, Sec. 312.62 and Sec. 812.140(a)(3)) require investigators to prepare and maintain adequate case histories recording all observations and other data pertinent to the investigation on each individual treated with the drug or exposed to the device. The agency needs all such data in order to be able to determine the safety and effectiveness of the drug or device. The fact of having been in an investigation cannot be taken back. Also, if a subject were able to control the use (inclusion and exclusion) of his or her data, and particularly if the clinical investigation were not blinded, the bias potential would be immense. Thus, the agency rejects this comment because it could prevent FDA from learning of an important effect of the product and significantly bias the results of the investigation” (”see comment 95, 61 Federal Register 51498, 51519, October 2, 1996). It should be appreciated that FDA’s response applies to the most potentially difficult situation, that is, studies involving an exception from the informed consent requirements in which subjects, due to a life threatening medical condition, are unable to provide informed consent to participate in the study. Subjects may subsequently withdraw from such studies, but the data collected up to withdrawal may not be removed.\n5 Such review of safety data by sponsors is required by 21 CFR 312.56 and 21 CFR 812.46.\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\nThe validity of a clinical study would also be compromised by the exclusion of data collected during the study. There is long-standing concern with the removal of data, particularly when removal is non-random, a situation called “informative censoring.” FDA has long advised “intent-to-treat” analyses (analyzing data related to all subjects the investigator intended to treat), and a variety of approaches for interpretation and imputation of missing data have been developed to maintain study validity.6 Complete removal of data, possibly in a non-random or informative way, raises great concerns about the validity of the study.\nThere is particular concern with a study’s reliability when subjects withdraw their data in a non-random way because they are unhappy with their experience, either because they failed to obtain a desired effect or suffered an adverse event. Loss of these subjects’ data could greatly distort effectiveness results and could hide important safety information (for example, toxicity) of a poorly tolerated treatment. Allowing subjects to withdraw data could even provide an opportunity for unscrupulous parties to “improve” study results by selectively encouraging certain subjects to withdraw from a study.\nThe importance of ensuring the scientific validity of clinical research is reflected not only in FDA’s regulations but in international documents and published literature as well. The International Conference on Harmonization of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH), in which FDA participates, identifies as a principle of good clinical practice that “clinical trials should be scientifically sound.\"7 Other international guidance documents include similar statements, such as the International Ethical Guidelines for Biomedical Research Involving Human Subjects, Guideline 1, which states “scientifically invalid research is unethical in that it exposes research subjects to risks without possible benefit …”8\nPublished literature on medical research ethics, dating back to the Nuremburg Code of 1947,9 also emphasizes the importance of scientific validity. As maintained by\n6 For a discussion of problems presented by missing data in the analysis of clinical trials, please see “Points to Consider on Missing Data” from the Committee for Proprietary Medicinal Products of the European Medicines Agency (EMEA), .\n7 . ICH E6 Guidance for Industry, “Good Clinical Practice: Consolidated Guidance,” adopted as official guidance by FDA, Section 2.5.\n8 . These guidelines are published by the Counsel of International Organizations for Medical Sciences (CIOMS). Guideline 11 reiterates this principle.\n9 The Nuremberg Code: \nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\nEmanuel, et. al., “For a clinical research protocol to be ethical, the methods must be valid and practically feasible: the research must have a clear scientific objective; be designed using accepted principles, methods, and reliable practices; have sufficient power to definitively test the objective; and offer a plausible data analysis plan.”10 The importance of scientific validity to ethical research is also underscored in modern ethical documents, such as the Declaration of Helsinki11 and the Belmont Report, issued in 1979 by the National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research.12\nIn summary, data collected on study subjects up to the time of withdrawal must remain in the trial database in order for the study to be scientifically valid. If a subject withdraws from a study, removal of already collected data would undermine the scientific, and therefore the ethical, integrity of the research. Such removal of data could also put enrolled subjects, future subjects, and eventual users of marketed products at an unreasonable risk. Finally, removal of data would fundamentally compromise FDA’s ability to perform its mission, to protect public health and safety by ensuring the safety and effectiveness of regulated products.\nIV. FDA POLICY\nFollowing are key points regarding FDA’s policy on the withdrawal of subjects from a clinical investigation, whether the subject elects to discontinue further interventions or the clinical investigator terminates the subject’s participation in further interventions:\n10 Emanuel, EJ, Wendler, D, and Grady, C., “What Makes Clinical Research Ethical?” JAMA 283:20 (May 24/31, 2000 2701-11).\n11 \"Medical research involving human subjects must conform to generally accepted scientific principles, be based on a thorough knowledge of the scientific literature, other relevant sources of information, and on adequate laboratory and, where appropriate, animal experimentation.\" The Declaration of Helsinki (2000) (as amended 2002, 2004) .\n12 The Belmont Report addresses the connection between scientific validity and ethics through the Principle of Beneficence. Beneficence has two complementary aspects: maximizing possible benefits and minimizing possible harms. The Report recognizes as one of the components of maximizing benefits, \"In the case of scientific research in general, members of the larger society are obliged to recognize the longer term benefits and risks that may result from the improvement of knowledge and from the development of novel medical, psychotherapeutic, and social procedures.\" \nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\nAccording to FDA regulations, when a subject withdraws from a study, the data collected on the subject to the point of withdrawal remains part of the study database and may not be removed.\nAn investigator may ask a subject who is withdrawing whether the subject wishes to provide continued follow-up and further data collection subsequent to their withdrawal from the interventional portion of the study. Under this circumstance, the discussion with the subject would distinguish between study-related interventions and continued follow-up of associated clinical outcome information, such as medical course or laboratory results obtained through non-invasive chart review, and address the maintenance of privacy and confidentiality of the subject’s information.\nIf a subject withdraws from the interventional portion of the study, but agrees to continued follow-up of associated clinical outcome information as described in the previous bullet, the investigator must obtain the subject’s informed consent for this limited participation in the study (assuming such a situation was not described in the original informed consent form). In accordance with FDA regulations, IRB approval of informed consent documents would be required (21 CFR 50.25, 56.109(b), 312.60, 312.66, 812.100).\nIf a subject withdraws from the interventional portion of a study and does not consent to continued follow-up of associated clinical outcome information, the investigator must not access for purposes related to the study the subject’s medical record or other confidential records requiring the subject’s consent. However, an investigator may review study data related to the subject collected prior to the subject’s withdrawal from the study, and may consult public records, such as those establishing survival status.", "source": "wikidoc", "question": "According to authoritative FDA guidance, discuss how investigators and sponsors should manage and use data when a subject withdraws from the interventional portion of a clinical trial, addressing (1) retention and inclusion of already‑accrued data in the study database, (2) circumstances and requirements for obtaining consent for continued non‑interventional follow‑up and necessary IRB approvals, (3) limits on accessing medical records if the subject declines follow‑up, and (4) the rationale and regulatory implications of these policies for study validity and regulatory submissions."}

He entered Harvard College at seventeen. After graduating cum laude three years later he entered Harvard Medical School. While he initially took an interest in obstetrics and orthopedic surgery, the discovery of insulin attracted him to internal medicine, specifically the study of metabolism. After his internship at Massachusetts General Hospital he embarked on a one-year programme of research with Joseph C. Aub, mainly into calcium metabolism and lead poisoning. He was subsequently assistant resident to Dr Warfield Longcope at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, where he performed numerous experiments (often without realising their significance), together with his friend John Eager Howard. Finally he spent a year in Vienna with pathologist Prof Jacob Erdheim.\nIn the early 1930s he returned to Boston, where he became a member of the staff of Massachusetts General Hospital. He married Claire Birge in 1933; they had two sons. At MGH he rapidly developed an endocrinology research group.\n\n# Work at MGH\nAlbright is credited with numerous discoveries in medicine. He described polyostotic fibrous dysplasia (later eponymically called McCune-Albright syndrome), the clinical and pathological features and different types of hyperparathyroidism (excessive production of parathyroid hormone by the parathyroid glands), the mechanism of Cushing's syndrome, renal tubular acidosis (inability of the kidneys to regulate the acid-base balance in the body), and recognised the importance of menopause on osteoporosis. He also delineated forms of congenital adrenal hyperplasia.\nHe was the president of the American Society for Clinical Investigation (1943-1944), the Association for the Study of Internal Secretions (1945-1946) and the Endocrine Society (1946-1947). In 1955 he was elected to the National Academy of the Sciences.\n\n# Illness and death\nHe developed Parkinson's disease in 1937. By 1956 his symptoms were so intractable that he underwent experimental brain surgery, chemical pallidectomy (obliteration of the globus pallidus by injection of alcohol).

{"guideline_text": "TRIM28\nTripartite motif-containing 28 (TRIM28), also known as transcriptional intermediary factor 1β (TIF1β) and KAP1 (KRAB-associated protein-1), is a protein that in humans is encoded by the TRIM28 gene.\n\n# Function\nThe protein encoded by this gene mediates transcriptional control by interaction with the Krüppel-associated box repression domain found in many transcription factors. The protein localizes to the nucleus and is thought to associate with specific chromatin regions. The protein is a member of the tripartite motif family. This tripartite motif includes three zinc-binding domains, a RING, a B-box type 1 and a B-box type 2, and a coiled-coil region.\nKAP1 is a ubiquitously expressed protein involved in many critical functions including: transcriptional regulation, cellular differentiation and proliferation, DNA damage repair, viral suppression, and apoptosis.(4)  Its functionality is dependent upon post-translational modifications.  Phosphorylation of KAP1 acts as a deactivator of the protein in many of its mechanisms while sumoylation acts as an activator.\n\n## Cellular differentiation and proliferation\nStudies have shown that deletion of KAP1 in mice before gastrulation results in death (implicating it as a necessary protein for proliferation) while deletion in adult mice results in increased anxiety and stress-induced alterations in learning and memory.  KAP1 has been shown to participate in the maintenance of pluripotency of embryonic stem cells and to promote and inhibit cellular differentiation of adult cell lines.  Increased levels of KAP1 have been found in liver, gastric, breast, lung, and prostate cancers as well, indicating that it may play an important role in tumor cell proliferation (possibly by inhibiting apoptosis).\n\n## Transcriptional regulation\nKAP1 can regulate genomic transcription through a variety of mechanisms, many of which remain somewhat unclear.  Studies have shown that KAP1 can repress transcription by binding directly to the genome (which can be sufficient in and of itself) or through the induction of heterochromatin formation via the Mi2α-SETB1-HP1 macromolecular complex.  KAP1 can also interact with histone methyltransferases and deacetylases via the C-terminal PHD and Bromodomain to control transcription epigenetically.\n\n## DNA damage repair response\nIt has been shown that ATM phosphorylates KAP1 upon the discovery of damaged or broken DNA.  Phosphorylated KAP1, along with many other DNA damage proteins, rapidly migrate to the site of the DNA damage.  Its exact involvement in this pathway is somewhat unclear, but it has been implicated in triggering cell arrest, allowing for the damaged DNA to be repaired.\n\n## Apoptosis\nKAP1 forms a complex with MDM2 (a ubiquitin E3 ligase) that binds to p53.  The complex marks the bound p53 for degradation.  p53 is a known precursor of apoptosis that facilitates the synthesis of proteins necessary for cell death so its degradation results in apoptosis inhibition.\n\n# Clinical significance\n\n## Role in the establishment of viral latency\nKAP1 facilitates the establishment of viral latency in certain cell types for Human Cytomegalovirus (HCMV) and other endogenous retroviruses\n.  KAP1 acts as a transcriptional corepressor of the viral genome.  The protein binds to the histones of the viral chromatin and then recruits Mi2α and SETB1.  SETB1 is a histone methyltransferase that recruits HP1, thus inducing heterochromatin formation.  This heterochromatin formation prevents the transcription of the viral genome.  mTOR has been implicated in the phosphorylation of KAP1 resulting in a switch from latency to the lytic cycle.\n\n## Manipulations and potential for future treatment\nAtaxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) is a kinase that (similar to mTOR) can phosphorylate KAP1 resulting in the switch from viral latency to the lytic cycle.  Chloroquine (an ATM) activator has been shown to result in increases in transcription of the HCMV genome.  This effect is augmented by the use of tumor necrosis factor    It has been proposed that this treatment (accompanied by antiretroviral treatment) has the potential to purge the virus from infected individuals.\n\n# Interactions\nTRIM28 has been shown to interact with:\n- CBX5,\n- CEBPB,\n- Glucocorticoid receptor,\n- SETDB1  and\n- ZNF10.", "source": "wikidoc", "question": "According to authoritative guidelines summarised above, discuss how TRIM28 (KAP1) modulates transcription, DNA damage response, apoptosis, and viral latency, and explain the mechanistic rationale and potential clinical implications for targeting TRIM28 in cancer and strategies aimed at purging latent viral infections."}
{"guideline_text": "Niraparib for maintenance treatment of advanced ovarian, fallopian tube and peritoneal cancer after response to first-line platinum-based chemotherapy\n\nEvidence-based recommendations on niraparib (Zejula) for maintenance treatment of advanced (FIGO stages 3 and 4) high-grade epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer after response to first-line platinum-based chemotherapy in adults.\n\n# Recommendations\nNiraparib is recommended for use within the Cancer Drugs Fund as an option for maintenance treatment for advanced (FIGO stages 3 and 4) high-grade epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer after response to first-line platinum-based chemotherapy in adults. It is recommended only if the conditions in the managed access agreement for niraparib are followed.\nThis recommendation is not intended to affect treatment with niraparib that was started in the NHS before this guidance was published. People having treatment outside this recommendation may continue without change to the funding arrangements in place for them before this guidance was published, until they and their NHS clinician consider it appropriate to stop.\nWhy the committee made these recommendations\nThere are no maintenance treatments routinely available for advanced ovarian, fallopian tube or peritoneal cancer that has responded to first-line platinum-based chemotherapy. For some people, maintenance treatment is available through the Cancer Drugs Fund.\nClinical evidence comes from PRIMA, an ongoing clinical trial, which shows that niraparib delays disease progression. But it has not shown whether people having niraparib live longer, because they have not been followed up for long enough.\nBecause of the clinical uncertainty, the cost-effectiveness estimates are very uncertain. They may be higher than what NICE normally considers an acceptable use of NHS resources. So, niraparib cannot be recommended for routine use in the NHS.\nLonger follow-up data from PRIMA could help address the uncertainty about the clinical effectiveness of niraparib in this population. Niraparib has the potential to be a cost-effective use of NHS resources. So, it is recommended for use in the Cancer Drugs Fund while more data from the trial are collected.# Information about niraparib\n\n# Marketing authorisation indication\nNiraparib (Zejula, GlaxoSmithKline) has a marketing authorisation in the UK 'as monotherapy for the maintenance treatment of adult patients with advanced epithelial (FIGO Stages 3 and 4) high-grade ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer who are in response (complete or partial) following completion of first-line platinum-based chemotherapy'.\n\n# Dosage in the marketing authorisation\nThe dosage schedule is available in the summary of product characteristics.\n\n# Price\nThe list price is £4,500 for 56 100‑mg tablets (excluding VAT; BNF online accessed November 2020). The company has a commercial arrangement. This makes niraparib available to the NHS with a discount. The size of the discount is commercial in confidence. It is the company's responsibility to let relevant NHS organisations know details of the discount.# Committee discussion\nThe appraisal committee considered evidence submitted by GlaxoSmithKline, a review of this submission by the evidence review group (ERG), NICE's technical report, and responses from stakeholders. See the committee papers for full details of the evidence.\nThe appraisal committee was aware that several issues were resolved during the technical engagement stage, and agreed that:\nthe first-line treatment response rates from the PRIMA trial were generalisable to rates seen in UK practice (issue 1, see technical report page 2)\nthe dose of niraparib included in the model for continued treatment after 3 years is appropriate (issue 1, see technical report page 2)\nnot including the long-term remission assumption in the model is appropriate (issue 7, see technical report page 11).\nAt technical engagement, the company accepted the ERG's revised costs for heart rate and blood pressure monitoring and the alternative resource-use estimates for progression-free survival in the routine surveillance arm.\nThe committee recognised that there were remaining areas of uncertainty associated with the analyses presented and took these into account in its decision making. It discussed the following issues (issues 1 to 6 and 8 to 12), which were outstanding after the technical engagement stage.\n\n# The condition\n\n## People with ovarian cancer would welcome a new effective maintenance therapy\nThe patient expert explained that advanced platinum-sensitive ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer is a devastating condition. Knowing that the disease can relapse is a major psychological burden for people with the disease and their families. For most people without a BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene mutation there are no first-line maintenance treatments available for disease that has responded to platinum-based chemotherapy, although bevacizumab is available for some people through the Cancer Drugs Fund. People who are not eligible for first-line maintenance treatment have routine surveillance until the disease relapses. The patient expert explained that taking a maintenance treatment has a psychological benefit and improves quality of life compared with being on routine surveillance, which can feel like waiting for the cancer to come back. The clinical experts agreed with the patient expert. The committee recognised the need for effective maintenance treatment options after first-line treatment for advanced disease. It concluded that people would welcome new maintenance treatment options.\n\n# Treatment pathway\n\n## There is an unmet need for maintenance treatments after first-line platinum-based chemotherapy\nFirst-line treatment for advanced ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer is surgery and platinum-based chemotherapy. Options for surgery are primary debulking surgery before first-line chemotherapy treatment, or interval debulking surgery between cycles of first-line chemotherapy. First-line maintenance treatment with a poly-ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitor is available through the Cancer Drugs Fund for people with a BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene mutation. For people without a BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene mutation, there are no first-line PARP inhibitor maintenance treatments. Routine surveillance is the only option for people who are not eligible for maintenance treatment. The clinical experts explained that there is a high unmet need for more maintenance treatment options after first-line treatment for advanced disease. They noted that there is a clear population that would benefit from niraparib maintenance therapy at this point in the treatment pathway. The committee concluded that there is an unmet need for new effective maintenance treatment options after first-line platinum-based chemotherapy.\n\n# Clinical evidence\n\n## The population covered by niraparib's marketing authorisation indication is broader than the population included in PRIMA\nPRIMA is a double-blind, randomised controlled trial comparing niraparib with placebo as maintenance treatment of advanced ovarian cancer. It included people with or without a BRCA gene mutation, who had advanced (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics  stages 3 and 4) high-grade ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer that was in response (complete or partial) to first-line platinum-based chemotherapy. The primary end point was progression-free survival based on blinded independent central review. PRIMA excluded people with stage 3 cancer who had no visible residual disease after primary debulking surgery. The rationale for excluding this group was that their prognosis was considered to be better than other groups with advanced ovarian cancer. However, niraparib's marketing authorisation includes all people with stage 3 or 4 high-grade ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer who are in response to first-line platinum-based chemotherapy. The committee concluded that the population covered by the marketing authorisation indication is broader than the population included in PRIMA.\n\n## Prognosis of stage 3 cancer is likely to be better when there is no visible residual disease after primary debulking surgery, compared with after interval debulking surgery\nThe ERG commented on the prognosis of stage 3 cancer after surgery. It suggested that the prognosis for no visible residual disease might be similar when achieved by primary debulking surgery and interval debulking surgery. But the clinical experts explained that the prognosis for no visible residual disease after primary debulking surgery might be better than after interval debulking surgery. This is based on evidence from the EORTC-NCIC trial, which compared the outcomes of people with ovarian cancer with no visible residual disease after either type of surgery. The group with the best prognosis in the EORTC-NCIC trial was people with no visible residual disease after primary debulking surgery. However, the clinical experts explained that there is still uncertainty around which type of surgery leads to the best outcomes, and that the biggest prognostic factor is having no visible residual disease. The committee concluded it is likely that the prognosis of stage 3 cancer is better when there is no visible residual disease after primary debulking surgery, compared with after interval debulking surgery.\n\n## The treatment effect of niraparib is likely to be similar irrespective of surgery type\nThe clinical experts explained that although prognosis is likely to be different after primary debulking surgery compared with interval debulking surgery, they would not expect there to be a difference in the treatment effect of niraparib after either type of surgery. They highlighted that niraparib has been shown to be effective as a first-line maintenance treatment (see section 3.10) and for maintenance treatment for relapsed disease. There is no reason to expect that the outcomes after niraparib treatment would differ because of the type of surgery that had been done, if there is no visible residual disease. The committee concluded that the treatment effect of niraparib is likely to be similar for stage 3 cancer that has no visible residual disease after either primary debulking surgery or interval debulking surgery.\n\n## The proportion of people with stage 3 cancer and no visible residual disease after surgery is highly uncertain\nThe clinical experts explained that there is variation in the rate of achieving no visible residual disease after surgery in clinical practice in England. They also explained that the rates of primary debulking surgery and interval debulking surgery vary, because neither is widely accepted as the standard of care. They estimated that about 25% to 50% of people with advanced ovarian cancer may have stage 3 cancer and no visible residual disease after primary debulking surgery. However, this estimate is not reliable because there is no evidence available to support it. The committee concluded that the proportion of people with stage 3 cancer and no visible residual disease after surgery is highly uncertain, and there is no robust estimate of the size of this population in clinical practice.\n\n## The PRIMA intention-to-treat analysis is appropriate for decision-making\nPRIMA did not include people with stage 3 cancer and no visible residual disease after primary debulking surgery. However, this population is included within the marketing authorisation indication (see section 3.3). Although the prognosis is likely to be different for no visible residual disease after primary debulking surgery compared with interval debulking surgery (see section 3.4), niraparib's treatment effect is unlikely to be different (see section 3.5). The company presented an analysis to adjust for the difference in prognosis between these groups. This used data from a clinical trial (PAOLA‑1) of olaparib (a different PARP inhibitor) to show the treatment effect for a simulated 'PRIMA intention-to-treat population', which excluded people with stage 3 cancer and no visible residual disease after primary debulking surgery, compared with a population that included only these people. The ERG explained that although there is a difference in prognosis between these groups, the effect of this cannot be reliably estimated. And the PAOLA-1 data are not generalisable to PRIMA because of differences in the treatments taken. It explained that even if the treatment effect could be reliably estimated, the proportion of people with stage 3 cancer and no visible residual disease after primary debulking surgery could not be reliably estimated (see section 3.6). The clinical experts agreed that there are no robust estimates of the proportion of people with stage 3 cancer and no visible residual disease irrespective of the type of surgery they had, so it is not possible to reliably adjust the PRIMA intention-to-treat data. The ERG explained that adjusting the PRIMA intention-to-treat data by reweighting the population with stage 3 cancer and no visible residual disease after interval debulking surgery would rely on having an estimate of the proportion of people with stage 3 cancer and no visible residual disease after primary debulking surgery. The committee acknowledged that PRIMA did not include people with stage 3 cancer and no visible residual disease after primary debulking surgery, and there was no reliable method to adjust the PRIMA data to account for this. It concluded that the population in PRIMA does not fully reflect the population who would likely be offered niraparib in clinical practice, but the PRIMA intention-to-treat analysis is appropriate for decision making.\n\n## PRIMA is generalisable to the dosage used in clinical practice\nBecause of a protocol change during the study, about two-thirds of people in PRIMA took a fixed dose of 300 mg of niraparib and around one-third took an individualised dose of niraparib based on weight and platelet count. The clinical experts explained that individualised dosing would be used in practice because of toxicity concerns, which is reflected in the summary of product characteristics. The company did subgroup analyses of fixed and individualised dosing in PRIMA. These suggested that niraparib increased progression-free survival compared with placebo, irrespective of the type of dosing. The ERG suggested that these analyses should be considered exploratory because they were done post hoc and were non-stratified. The committee agreed that the analyses were uncertain because the individualised dosing group had fewer participants and shorter follow up than the fixed-dose group. Also, PRIMA was not powered to show a difference between the dosing groups. The committee acknowledged that the progression-free survival benefit is more uncertain for the individualised dosing group, as shown by wider confidence intervals. It noted that the summary of product characteristics states that exploratory subgroup analyses of fixed and individualised dosing show comparable efficacy for them both. The clinical experts explained that based on the dose taken by participants in PRIMA, it was likely to be generalisable to clinical practice. They also noted that niraparib's efficacy using individualised dosing is supported by evidence from NOVA (a study of niraparib in relapsed disease). This suggested that a dose of less than 300 mg does not reduce efficacy. The committee concluded that the evidence in PRIMA is generalisable to the dose which will be used in clinical practice.\n\n## Subsequent treatments used in PRIMA are not fully representative of clinical practice, but data are generalisable to clinical practice\nOf the participants who had progressed disease in PRIMA, 85% of people on niraparib and 81% on routine surveillance had chemotherapy after progression. The clinical experts explained that this reflects clinical practice, because PRIMA excluded people with stage 3 cancer and no visible residual disease after primary debulking surgery. So, people in PRIMA had a poorer prognosis than the population who would be eligible for niraparib in the NHS. A small percentage of participants in PRIMA had a PARP inhibitor or immunotherapy after first-line niraparib maintenance treatment. The clinical experts explained that this is not representative of clinical practice in England. The committee acknowledged that PRIMA included a small proportion of people having subsequent treatments that are not available in the NHS but concluded that the PRIMA data are generalisable to clinical practice.\n\n# Clinical effectiveness\n\n## Niraparib improves progression-free survival compared with placebo\nMedian progression-free survival in PRIMA was 13.8 months with niraparib and 8.2 months with placebo. The difference in median progression-free survival was 5.6 months (hazard ratio 0.62, 95% confidence interval 0.50 to 0.76; p<0.001). Subgroup analyses indicated that niraparib increases median progression-free survival compared with placebo for people with or without a BRCA gene mutation. The committee concluded that niraparib improves progression-free survival for people with ovarian cancer that has completely or partially responded to first-line platinum-based chemotherapy.\n\n## PRIMA data on overall survival and time to second progression are immature\nOverall survival was a secondary end point in PRIMA. Less than 11% of participants in PRIMA had died at the latest analysis (9.9% in the niraparib arm and 12.6% in the placebo arm). The difference in overall survival was not statistically significant (hazard ratio for death 0.70, 95% confidence interval 0.44 to 1.11) and it is not yet clear whether niraparib will improve overall survival. The clinical experts acknowledged the uncertainty in the results but suggested that niraparib might improve overall survival and may lead to cure in some people. Time from randomisation to disease progression on the next anti-cancer therapy (PFS2) was also a secondary end point in PRIMA. The PFS2 event rate (20%) was low and there was no statistically significant difference between niraparib and placebo (hazard ratio 0.81, 95% confidence interval 0.58 to 1.14). The committee concluded that the data for overall survival and PFS2 for niraparib after first-line treatment are immature and the survival benefit is uncertain.\n\n# The company's economic model\n\n## The company's model structure is appropriate for decision making\nThe company presented a 3‑state partitioned survival model to estimate the cost effectiveness of niraparib compared with routine surveillance. The 3 health states were progression-free, progressed disease and death. The committee noted that PFS2 data are available in PRIMA. These could have been used to inform a 4‑state model to capture the effect of second progression on quality of life and related costs. The company suggested that using a 4‑state model would add additional uncertainty because the PFS2 data are immature (see section 3.11). The committee concluded that although there are uncertainties with the company's 3‑state model, it is robust enough for decision making.\n\n## The overall-survival estimates in the company's model are highly uncertain\nA key driver of the results in the model is the way in which overall-survival estimates for niraparib are derived. The company estimated overall survival for the routine surveillance arm by fitting a log-logistic accelerated failure time model to the observed overall-survival data from PRIMA. The estimates were validated against overall-survival data for people on routine surveillance over 15 years from the University of Edinburgh Ovarian Cancer Database. The company estimated overall survival in the niraparib arm using a hazard ratio derived from assuming a 1:2 ratio for progression-free survival gain to overall-survival gain, and applied this to the log-logistic routine surveillance overall-survival curve. This ratio is based on an assumption that a 1‑month gain in progression-free survival leads to a 2‑month gain in overall survival. The ratio was chosen based on the relationship between progression-free survival and overall survival in a study of olaparib compared with routine surveillance as second-line maintenance treatment (Study 19), which has long-term follow-up data. The ERG considered that there was not sufficient evidence to support the use of a progression-free survival to overall-survival ratio or to determine what ratio would be most appropriate. It explained that the hazard ratio derived from the 1:2 ratio used in the company's model did not reflect the hazard ratio observed for overall survival in PRIMA (see section 3.11). The ERG also explained that it is methodologically inappropriate to apply a hazard ratio to a log-logistic accelerated failure time model, which does not assume proportional hazards. Also, using a hazard ratio assumes a constant treatment effect over time and there is no evidence to support this assumption. The company highlighted that in other studies of olaparib maintenance such as Study 19, overall survival improved for olaparib compared with routine surveillance as more data accumulated during follow up. The committee acknowledged that the PRIMA overall-survival data are very immature. So, it is not known if the long-term results will show improvement in overall survival of a similar magnitude for niraparib as that seen with olaparib in Study 19. The clinical experts considered that the company's assumption that overall-survival benefit is twice the progression-free survival benefit is plausible. But they stated that the overall-survival data from PRIMA are too immature to reliably quantify the overall-survival benefit. Overall-survival data for niraparib are available in PRIMA. The company could have extrapolated long-term overall survival for niraparib, as it did for the routine surveillance arm. The committee was disappointed that these data had not been included in the company's model. The company did not consider it appropriate to extrapolate the overall-survival data from PRIMA, because there were no real-world data that could be used to validate the curve for the treatment arm. The ERG highlighted that any estimation of overall survival should be validated, as should the use of a ratio for progression-free survival gain to overall-survival gain. The committee acknowledged that extrapolated overall-survival from PRIMA data would be uncertain, but the ratio of progression-free survival to overall-survival is also uncertain. It concluded that overall-survival gain may be at least equivalent to progression-free survival gain. But it is highly uncertain whether the overall-survival gain will exceed the progression-free survival gain, or by how much. It concluded that further overall-survival data will reduce the uncertainty.\n\n# Assumptions in the economic model\n\n## Time to treatment discontinuation is modelled appropriately by the company\nThe summary of product characteristics for niraparib recommends that treatment should be continued until disease progression or toxicity. It does not include a time-limited stopping rule. The company included a stopping rule in its model, which assumed that 15% of people who had not stopped treatment at 3 years would continue to have niraparib. A 3‑year stopping rule was included in PRIMA, but some people took niraparib for longer than 3 years. The ERG noted that the proportion of people who continued taking niraparib after 3 years is unknown, so the ERG's base case did not include treatment discontinuation at 3 years. The clinical experts explained that most people would stop treatment with niraparib at 3 years unless there was evidence of stable, persistent disease. They considered that the proportion of people assumed to stop niraparib at 3 years in the company's model is appropriate. The committee concluded that the company's approach, which assumed a proportion of people stopping treatment at 3 years, is appropriate.\n\n## Age-related utility decrements should be included in the model\nThe company did not include age-related utility decrements in its base-case analysis. It suggested that this is appropriate because the quality of life measured in PRIMA was consistent across age groups and did not change considerably over a 56‑week period. The ERG explained that the company's approach overestimates both the utility of people as they age and the cost effectiveness of niraparib. The ERG included age-related utility decrements in its analyses. The committee agreed it is reasonable to assume that people's quality of life decreases as they age, which should be reflected in the model. The committee did not consider the company's justification for not including age-related utility decrements to be valid. It concluded that age-related utility decrements should be included in the model.\n\n## Subsequent treatments are modelled appropriately, but data are immature\nThe ERG noted that the PRIMA data are not mature enough to understand which second-line, third-line and maintenance treatments will be offered to people whose disease relapses. It highlighted the importance of interpreting overall-survival data alongside data on subsequent treatments after disease progression. This may be possible when more mature data becomes available from PRIMA. Because the subsequent treatments in the immature PRIMA data were not wholly representative of the treatment options in clinical practice (see section 3.9), the company obtained the costs for subsequent treatments from key opinion leaders and used these in its model. The committee concluded that the data on subsequent treatments in PRIMA are immature, but the company appropriately included subsequent treatments that are reflective of clinical practice in its model.\n\n# Cost-effectiveness results\n\n## None of the analyses reflect the committee's preferred assumptions\nBecause of confidential commercial arrangements for subsequent treatments in relapsed disease, none of the cost-effectiveness results are reported here. But none of the company's or ERG's analyses reflected the committee's preferences, which are as follows:\nuse the PRIMA intention-to-treat population (see section 3.7)\nuse a progression-free survival gain to overall-survival gain ratio of 1:1 (see section 3.13)\ndo not include a long-term remission assumption or costs in the progression-free survival health state after 10 years, which was agreed at technical engagement\ninclude the stopping rule with 15% of people still on niraparib at 3 years continuing treatment (see section 3.14)\ninclude age-related utility decrements (see section 3.15)\ninclude the revised costs of monitoring heart rate and blood pressure, which was accepted by the company at technical engagement\ninclude the alternative resource-use estimates for routine surveillance during progression-free survival, which was accepted by the company at technical engagement.\n\n## Niraparib is not recommended for routine use in the NHS\nThe committee acknowledged that the company's incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were within the range usually considered a cost-effective use of NHS resources. But the committee's preferred ICER was not within the range usually considered a cost-effective use of NHS resources. It noted that the biggest driver of cost effectiveness was the niraparib overall-survival estimate and that this was highly uncertain. Therefore, the committee concluded that the ICER for niraparib compared with routine surveillance was very uncertain, and that it could not recommend niraparib maintenance treatment for routine NHS use in adults with advanced ovarian, fallopian tube and peritoneal cancer after response to first-line platinum-based chemotherapy.\n\n# Cancer Drugs Fund\n\n## Niraparib meets the Cancer Drugs Fund criteria\nHaving concluded that niraparib could not be recommended for routine use, the committee then considered if it could be recommended as maintenance treatment for advanced ovarian cancer after response to first-line platinum-based chemotherapy within the Cancer Drugs Fund. The committee discussed the arrangements for the Cancer Drugs Fund agreed by NICE and NHS England in 2016, noting NICE's Cancer Drugs Fund methods guide (addendum). It noted that:\nThe company expressed an interest in niraparib being considered for the Cancer Drugs Fund.\nData from PRIMA are immature and median overall survival was not reached in the placebo arm.\nPRIMA is still ongoing and further data could help reduce uncertainties about long-term progression-free survival, overall survival and time to second progression.\nOverall survival was a key driver of the cost-effectiveness results.\nThe Systemic Anti-Cancer Therapy dataset could provide data on stage 3 cancer with no visible residual disease after primary debulking surgery, the proportion of people having subsequent treatment and the treatments used.\nThe company's price for niraparib, including a commercial arrangement, means that it has plausible potential to be cost effective.The committee concluded that niraparib met the criteria to be considered for inclusion in the Cancer Drugs Fund. It recommended niraparib for use within the Cancer Drugs Fund as an option for people with advanced (FIGO stages 3 and 4) high-grade epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer after response to first-line platinum-based chemotherapy if the conditions in the managed access agreement are followed. When the guidance is next reviewed the company should use the committee's preferred assumptions as set out in section 3.17, unless new evidence indicates otherwise.\n\n# Innovation\n\n## The model is adequate to capture the benefits of niraparib\nThe company considered niraparib to be innovative. It explained that there are no PARP inhibitors available as first-line maintenance treatment for people who do not have a BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene mutation. It noted that niraparib will be the first treatment to offer the benefit of maintenance therapy to people with advanced ovarian cancer, irrespective of BRCA mutation status. The clinical experts agreed that niraparib would be a step-change in the first-line treatment of advanced ovarian cancer for people without a BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene mutation. The committee considered that the model included all health-related quality-of-life benefits. It concluded that it had not been presented with evidence of any additional benefits from maintenance treatment with niraparib that had not already been included.\n\n# Other factors\nNo equality or social value judgements issues were identified.\nNICE's advice about life-extending treatments for people with a short life expectancy did not apply.", "source": "nice", "question": "According to NICE guidance, discuss the committee's rationale for recommending niraparib for use within the Cancer Drugs Fund (rather than for routine NHS use) as first‑line maintenance treatment for adults with advanced (FIGO stages 3–4) high‑grade epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer after response to platinum‑based chemotherapy, addressing: the key clinical trial evidence (PRIMA) and what it shows and does not show; the principal uncertainties that drove the cost‑effectiveness decision (including overall survival, population generalisability and subsequent treatments); the committee’s preferred assumptions for economic modelling; and how these considerations support managed access and further data collection under the Cancer Drugs Fund."}
{"guideline_text": "Dydrogesterone\nDydrogesterone is a progestogen hormone. The brand name is Duphaston and manufactured by Solvay Pharmaceuticals.\nDydrogesterone was first introduced to the market in 1961, and is currently approved in over 100 countries world-wide. It has an estimated cumulative exposure of more than 28 million patients.\nDydrogesterone is a potent, orally active progestogen indicated in a wide variety of gynaecological conditions. Although similar in molecular structure and pharmacological effects to endogenous progesterone. It is orally active at far lower doses. Its freedom from oestrogenic, androgenic, anabolic, corticoid and other undesirable hormonal effects gives it additional benefits over most other synthetic progestogens.\nThe therapeutic use of dydrogesterone is closely related to its physiological action on the neuro-endocrine control of ovarian function, as well as on the endometrium. As such, it is indicated in all cases of relative or absolute endogeneous progesterone deficiency.\nDydrogesterone has proven effective in the following conditions:\n- menstrual disorders\n- infertility\n- threatened and habitual abortion\n- endometriosis\n- premenstrual syndrome\nDydrogesterone has also been registered as hormone replacement therapy (HRT) to counteract the negative effects of unopposed oestrogen on the endometrium. Dydrogesterone is safe and well-tolerated. The incidence of side-effects is remarkably low.\n\n# Indications\nDydrogesterone In Menstrual Disorders\nDysmenorrhoea\nPrimary or essential dysmenorrhoea is one of the most common gynaecological complaints of women during their reproductive years. Dydrogesterone relieves the pain associated with incapacitating dysmenorrhoea, decreases the need for analgesics and reduces absenteeism from work.\nSecondary amenorrhoea\nSecondary amenorrhoea is a symptom rather than a specific disease. Dydrogesterone adequately induces bleeding when the endometrium is sufficiently primed with oestrogens. When oestradiol levels are low, dydrogesterone treatment should be supplemented with oestrogens.\nDysfunctional uterine bleeding and irregular cycles\nOf the wide range of medications used to reduce heavy menstrual bleeding in patients with ovulatory cycles, oral progestogens like dydrogesterone are the most commonly prescribed. It prevents heavy bleeding.\nDydrogesterone in Infertility and Threatend and Habitual Abortion\nLuteal insufficiency\nLuteal insufficiency leads to inadequate ovarian progesterone production, which in turn results in an incomplete secretory endometrium and ineffective ovum implantation. Dydrogesterone almost doubles pregnancy rates compared to placebo.\nThreatened and habitual abortion\nThe incidence of spontaneous abortion is about 15% of all clinically recognised pregnancies. Progestogens are commonly used in threatened and habitual abortion. They are thought to exert their effect in two ways. Firstly, by restoring luteal function, thereby decreasing the incidence of first trimester abortions. Secondly, through relaxation of the smooth musculature of the uterus. More recently, the evidence indicates that modulation of the maternal immune response during early pregnancy also contributes to the anti-abortive effects of dydrogesterone. In clinical practise, dydrogesterone achieved success rates of 70% or higher.\nDydrogesterone is recommended in the treatment of infertility for several reasons:\n- it has no inhibitory effect on ovulation\n- it does not alter the normal pattern of secretory transformation of the endometrium\n- it does not inhibit the formation of progesterone in the human placenta during early pregnancy\n- it does not cause masculinisation of the female foetus.\nDydrogesterone in Endometriosis\nEndometriosis is a chronic disease which can cause severe, progressive, and at times, incapacitating dysmenorrhoea, pelvic pain, dyspareunia and infertility. Dydrogesterone relieves pain without inhibiting ovulation, so that patients are able to become pregnant during treatment. The efficacy of dydrogesterone on the lesions of endometriosis is less clear, but their number and severity does not seem to correlate with the severity of symptoms.\nDydrogesterone in Premenstrual Syndrome\nPremenstrual syndrome (PMS) is characterised by a range of mood swings and physical symptoms.\nDydrogesterone effectively relieves a number of these and is especially indicated when:\n- PMS is associated with hypermenorrhoea and dysmenorrhoea\n- other treatments such as oral contraceptives for ovulation suppression, or psychotropic medication are contraindicated.\nDydrogesterone in Hormone Replacement Therapy\nThe principle behind HRT is twofold:\n- to actively increase the circulating levels of oestrogens to control hot flushes\n- to prevent the long-term effects of the menopause, such as bone resorption and unfavourable changes in blood lipids\nThe administration of 17β-oestradiol halts, or reverses atrophic changes that occur due to the loss of endogenous oestradiol during the menopause.\nOestrogens stimulate the growth of endometrial cells. In postmenopausal women with an intact uterus, oestrogen monotherapy results in continued endometrial proliferation without the physiological secretory transformation normally induced by progesterone. This process is associated with an increased incidence of endometrial hyperplasia and carcinoma. Additional protection with progestogens is therefore mandatory in patients with an intact uterus who receive oestrogen replacement therapy.\nDydrogesterone opposes the proliferative effect of oestrogens on the endometrium and ensures conversion to a secretory patern and cyclical shedding of the endometrium in sequential HRT regimens. As such dydrogesterone effectively guards against the development of endometrial hyperplasia. Unlike androgenic progestogens, dydrogesterone does not reverse the beneficial effects of 17β-oestradiol on lipid profiles and carbohydrate metabolism. This make it a progestogen of choice, as illustrated by its excellent cycle control in sequential combined HRT. In a continuous combined HRT regimen, dydrogesterone inhibits the proliferation of the endometrium so that it remains atrophic or inactive. The majority of patients become amenorhhoeic after 6 months of treatment.\n\n# Chemistry\nDydrogesterone (9Β, 10α-pregna-4, 6-diene-3, 20-dione) was first synthesised by Duphar in the 1950s. Although its molecular structure is almost identical to that of natural progesterone, its unique design makes it a potent, orally active progestogen. In the dydrogesterone molecule, the hydrogen atom at carbon 9 is in the beta position and the methyl group at carbon 10 is in the alpha position - a reverse of the progesterone structure, hence the term 'retro' progesterone. Furthermore, it has a second double bond between carbon 6 and carbon 7 (the 4, 6-diene-3-one configuration). These small differences in chemical structure account for the improved oral activitity, metabolic stability, and the lack of oestrogenic, androgenic and mineralo-corticoid properties of dydrogesterone.HE..HE..\n\n# Pharmacokinetics\nDydrogesterone is readily absorbed after oral administration. Tmax values vary between 0.5 and 2.5 hours.\nMetabolisation of dydrogesterone is virtually complete. The main metabolic reaction is hydrogenation of the 20-keto group, resulting in 20-dihydrodydrogesterone (DHD), another potent progestogen. The levels of the main active metabolite DHD also peak about 1.5 hours after dosing.\nAfter oral administration, plasma concentrations of DHD are substantially higher than those of the parent drug. The ratios of DHD/Dydrogesterone for AUC and Cmax are in the order of 40 and 25, respectively. Absolute bio-availability is on average 28%.\nAll the metabolites of dydrogesterone retain the 4, 6-diene-3-one structure, and are metabolically stable. As such, dydrogesterone does not undergo aromatisation, which is consistent with its absence of oestrogenic effects. Furthermore, dydrogesterone does not undergo 17α-hydroxylation, which explains its lack of androgenic effects.\nDydrogesterone has predictable pharmacokinetics. The single-dose kinetics are linear in the oral dose range of 5-20mg. The pharmacokinetics do not change during repeated administration of up to 20mg dydrogesterone once daily. Steady state is attained after 3 days of treatment.\nDydrogesterone and its metabolites are excreted predominantly in urine. About 85% of an oral dose is excreted within 24 hours. The mean terminal half-lives od dydrogesterone and DHD vary between 5-7 and 14-17 hours, respectively.\nIn HRT, dydrogesterone is administered together with an oestrogen. Therefore, the interaction between dydrogesterone and oestrogens has been assessed, and no clinically significant interaction has been observed.\n\n# Pharmacology\nDydrogesterone has superior pharmacological properties compared to endogenous progesterone:\n- it is orally active at low dosages\n- it has selective progestogenic properties without any traditional hormonal activity\nDydrogesterone is characterised by progestational and anti-oestrogenic activity. This is demonstrated by its ability to induce a secretory transformation in the endometrium of immature or ovariectomised animals after they have been primed with oestrogens (cf. the Clauberg test). The oral progestogenic potency of dydrogesterone is 20 times higher than that of progesterone.\nThe progestational efficacy and potency of dydrogesterone was confirmed by standard test (i.e. delay of menses and induction of withdrawal bleeding). The benefits of oestrogen or other target organs are not compromised by dydrogesterone.\nUnlike other synthetic progestogens, dydrogesterone is not chemically related to testosterone. Its low affinity for the androgen receptor explains why it has no unwanted androgenic or anti-androgenic effects even at high doses and after prolonged treatment:\n- no virilisation (acne, voice changes, hirsutism) of the adult female\n- no virilising effects on the genital tract of the female foetus\n- no effect on the fertility of the offspring.\nDydrogesterone is not converted into oestrogen, and has no adverse oestrogenic effects on fertility or sexual development.\nAt recommended doses, dydrogesterone has no effect on ovulation in healthy women:\n- the biphasic pattern of the basal body temperature is maintained\n- normal ovulatory rise in oestrogen and pregnanediol\n- normal premenstrual biopsy\n- no modification of vaginal cytology\n- cytological evidence of ovulation\n- the formation of the corpus luteum has been confirmed by laparotomy\nThese beneficial results are of particular relevance to the use of dydrogesterone in women who wish to become pregnant.\nDydrogesterone is free from adverse effects on carbohydrate metabolism. It does not cause changes in body weight, blood pressure, glucose tolerance or blood lipid ratios. No significant effects on blood coagulation or liver function tests have been reported. These favourable results are crucial in long-term therapy, e.g. postmenopausal HRT.\n\n# Toxicology\nNo serious or unexpected toxicity has been observed with dydrogesterone. In acute toxicity studies, the LD50 doses in rats exceeded 4,640mg/kg for the oral route.\nThere was no evidence of mutagenic potential in the Ames test.\n\n# Adverse Reaction\nBreakthrough bleeding (increase dose), altered liver function with asthenia or malaise, jaundice & abdominal pain.

{"guideline_text": "Cardiac electrophysiology\n\n# Overview\n- Cardiac electrophysiology (also referred to as clinical cardiac electrophysiology , or electrophysiology) is the science of the mechanisms, functions, and performance of the electrical activities of specific regions of the heart.\n- The normal electrical conduction in the heart allows the impulse that is generated by the sinoatrial node (SA node) of the heart to be propagated to (and stimulate) the myocardium (Cardiac muscle).  The myocardium contracts after stimulation.  It is the ordered stimulation of the myocardium that allows efficient contraction of the heart, thereby allowing blood to be pumped throughout the body.\n\n# Cardiac Conduction System\n- Proper cardiac function heavily depends on the ability of the cardiomyocytes to receive and propagate an electrical impulse allowing the heart to contract.\n- These impulses, known as action potentials,  originate and travel through the cardiac conduction system.\n- A time-ordered propagation of the electrical impulse through the myocardium allows efficient contraction of all four chambers of the heart, starting with the atria pumping the blood toward the ventricles, followed by the ventricles which contribute to the pulmonary and systemic circulation.\n\n### The Components of the Cardiac Conduction System:\n- The sinus (sinoatrial) node\n- The internodal tracts\n- The atrioventricular (AV) node\n- The His/AV bundle\n- The right and left bundle branches,\n- The Purkinje fibers.\n\n### The Direction of Propagation of the Action Potential:\n- The initial cardiac impulse, produced by pacemaker cells, originates in the sinoatrial (SA) node at the intersection of the right atrium and the superior vena cava.\n- This action potential is the trigger of every cardiac cycle, initiating the atrial then ventricular contractions; it is henceforth responsible for the rhythmic beating of the heart.\n- This action potential then propagates as a wave of depolarization through the internodal tracts initiating atrial contraction and then converging at the AV node.\nThe convergence occurs because, in a normal heart, the AV node is the only electrical connection between the atria and the ventricles.\nThe conduction of this potential is delayed at the AV node mainly due to the slower depolarization in these cells.\nThis delay is represented as the PR interval of the ECG.\n- The convergence occurs because, in a normal heart, the AV node is the only electrical connection between the atria and the ventricles.\n- The conduction of this potential is delayed at the AV node mainly due to the slower depolarization in these cells.\n- This delay is represented as the PR interval of the ECG.\n- The electrical impulse then moves to the ventricles by means of the AV or His bundle located in the superior portion of the interventricular septum.\n- It then continues moving apically and propagating through both ]ventricles via the right and left bundle branches, and the Purkinje fibers.\n- Section of the heart showing the ventricular septum.\n- Schematic representation of the atrioventricular bundle of His.\n\n# Normal Cardiac Action Potential\n- Similarly to skeletal muscle cells which are also striated muscles, the cardiomyocytes contract in response to a rapid alteration in the cell membrane’s potential.\n- However, the cardiomyocytes differ from skeletal muscle cells by three important variations that are essential for cardiac function:\n1) They can self-generate a change in cell membrane potential.\n2) The action potential can be transmitted directly from cell to cell.\n3) The action potentials have a significantly longer duration.\n- 1) They can self-generate a change in cell membrane potential.\n- 2) The action potential can be transmitted directly from cell to cell.\n- 3) The action potentials have a significantly longer duration.\n\n## The Resting Membrane Potential\n- All cells including cardiomyocytes have a resting membrane potential that is maintained assuming there is no electrical charge crossing the membrane from the intracellular towards the extracellular milieu or vice versa.\n- This potential is estimated to be –80 to –90 mV.\n- The most crucial ions that determine this resting potential are:\nSodium (Na+)\nCalcium (Ca2+)\nPotassium (K+)\n- Sodium (Na+)\n- Calcium (Ca2+)\n- Potassium (K+)\n- Sodium (Na+) and calcium (Ca2+) are most present in the interstitial fluid, while potassium (K+) is more present in intracellularly.\n- These ions are lipid insoluble which prevents them from crossing the lipid bilayer or the cell membrane.\n- Alternatively, ions cross via specific protein structures in the cell membrane that may be either: ion channels, ion pumps, or ion exchangers.\n- These transmembrane proteins are highly specific and allow only one type of ion to pass through which allows good maintenance of the membrane potential.\n- Ion channels can be opened, inactivated or closed depending on complex factors that modulate their activity.\n\n## The Cardiac Action Potential\n- The cardiac contraction action potential is divided into 5 phases.\n\n### Phase 0: Depolarization\n- The initial rapid increase in the transmembrane potential from -80mV to approximately +30mV constitutes the Phase 0 or the depolarization phase.\n- This depolarization results from a rapid increase in the membrane permeability to Na+ ions via opening of voltage-dependent fast Na+ channels allowing Na+ ions to move intracellularly according to their electrochemical gradient.\n- Following the conduction of an action potential, a recovery phase is attained where a large number of Na+ channels are inactivated, preventing the conduction of a second action potential.\n- When the membrane is fully repolarized, these channels are reactivated and allow the conduction of the following action potential.\n\n### Phase I: Initial Repolarization\n- The phase I of the action potential, known as the initial rapid repolarization ensues, resulting from K+ and Cl- ion flux across the membrane.\n- This forms the notch seen in the action potential following the depolarization.\n\n### Phase II: Plateau\n- Phase II, almost exclusive to cardiomyocytes, represents a plateau in the membrane potential as an outcome of the equilibrium between Ca2+ influx and K+ outflow.\n- The channels responsible for this Ca2+ influx are known as the L-type calcium channels, which are activated rapidly when the membrane potential reaches -50mV, but are slowly inactivated thereafter.\n- Throughout this plateau phase, few Na+ channels also remain active.\n- These are Na+/Ca2+ exchangers that allow 1 ion of calcium to move outside the cell for every 3 molecules of sodium moving inside the cell.\n\n### Phase III: Repolarization\n- The third phase, also known as rapid repolarization, depicts the restoration of a resting membrane potential.\n- It is initiated by inactivation of the L-type calcium channels and an increase in K+ outflow.\n- This change in potassium across the membrane is related to 3 K+ currents:\n1) Inwardly rectifying K+ current (IK1) à Produces the resting membrane potential\n2) Transient outward K+ current (ITO) à Accounts for initial part of repolarization\n3) Delayed outward K+ current (IK) à Responsible for final part of repolarization\n- 1) Inwardly rectifying K+ current (IK1) à Produces the resting membrane potential\n- 2) Transient outward K+ current (ITO) à Accounts for initial part of repolarization\n- 3) Delayed outward K+ current (IK) à Responsible for final part of repolarization\n- After repolarization has occurred, intracellular Na+ and extracellular K+ are rearranged via the Na+/K+ ATPase pump.\nThe ATPase moves 3 sodium ions out for every 2 potassium ions moved intracellularly.\n- The ATPase moves 3 sodium ions out for every 2 potassium ions moved intracellularly.\n- Equilibrium of ions across the membrane is also achieved via the Na+/Ca2+ exchangers.\n\n### Phase IV: Diastolic depolarization\n- The phase IV of the action potential is characterized by a diastolic depolarization that is both spontaneous and slow.\n- This phase provides cardiac cells with features of automaticity.\n- In a normal functioning heart, only the sinoatrial node is able to reach a threshold potential during phase IV making it the pacemaker of the heart.\n- Nevertheless other cells including those in the AV node, the His bundle, and the Purkinje fibers are able to reach a threshold and fire automatically if they are not suppressed by the SA node, which is true in some disease entities.\n- Inward Ca2+ current\n- Delayed outward K+ current\n- IF Currents – Inward sodium-potassium currents activated if membrane repolarizes below the If threshold\n- T-type Ca2+ channel – Releases calcium from internal stores\n- 1) The slope of diastolic depolarization\n- 2) The maximal diastolic potential\n- 3) The threshold potential\n- All these factors are controlled by the autonomic nervous system allowing for the modulation of the rate of SA node firing and subsequently the heart rate.\n\n# Electrophysiology Studies and Therapeutic Modalities\n\n## Overview\n- An electrophysiologic study is a term used to describe a number of invasive (intracardiac) and non-invasive recording of spontaneous electrical activity as well as of cardiac responses to programmed electrical stimulation.\n- These studies are performed to assess arrhythmias, elucidate symptoms, evaluate abnormal electrocardiograms, assess risk of developing arrhythmias in the future, and design treatment.\n- These procedures increasingly include therapeutic methods (typically radiofrequency ablation) in addition to diagnostic and prognostic procedures.\n- Other therapeutic modalities employed in this field include antiarrhythmic drug therapy and implantation of pacemakers and implantable cardioverter-defibrillators.\n- A specialist in cardiac electrophysiology is known as a cardiac electrophysiologist, or (more commonly) simply an electrophysiologist. Cardiac electrophysiology is considered a subspecialty of cardiology, and in most countries requires two or more years of fellowship training beyond a general cardiology fellowship. They are trained to perform interventional cardiac EP procedures as well as surgical device implantations.\n\n## Diagnostic Testing\n- Ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring (Holter recording and interpretation; loop recording and interpretation)\n- Tilt table testing\n- Signal-averaged electrocardiogram (SAECG) interpretation, also referred to as \"late potentials\" reading\n- Electrophysiologic study (EPS)\nPacing and recording electrodes are inserted either in the esophagus (intra-esophageal EPS) or, through blood vessels, directly into the heart chambers (intra-cardiac EPS) in order to measure electrical properties of the heart. In addition, intra-cardiac EPS electrically stimulates the heart and induces arrhythmias for diagnostic purposes (\"programmed electrical stimulation\").\n- Pacing and recording electrodes are inserted either in the esophagus (intra-esophageal EPS) or, through blood vessels, directly into the heart chambers (intra-cardiac EPS) in order to measure electrical properties of the heart. In addition, intra-cardiac EPS electrically stimulates the heart and induces arrhythmias for diagnostic purposes (\"programmed electrical stimulation\").\n\n## Medical Treatment\nElectrophysiologists play a role in:\n- The initial administration and monitoring of the effect of drugs for treatment of heart rhythm disorders\n- The management of severe or life threatening arrhythmias\n- The management of arrythmias requiring multiple drugs use\n\n## Catheter Ablation\n- Ablation therapy is the catheter based creation of lesions in the heart with radiofrequency energy, cryotherapy (destructive freezing), or ultrasound energy in order to cure or control arrhythmias (see radiofrequency ablation). Ablation is usually performed during the same procedure as the electrophysiology study which induces and confirms the diagnosis of the arrhythmia for which ablation therapy is sought.\n\n### Non-complex ablation\n- It includes ablation for arrhythmias such as: AV nodal reentrant tachycardia, accessory pathway mediated tachycardia and  atrial flutter.\n- This procedure is usually performed using intracardiac catheters , fluoroscopy (a real-time X-ray camera), and electrical recordings from the inside of the heart.\n\n### Complex ablation\n- It includes ablation for arrhythmias such as: multifocal atrial tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, and ventricular tachycardia.\n- In addition to the apparatus used for a \"non-complex\" ablation, these procedures often make use of sophisticated computer mapping systems to localize the source of the abnormal rhythm and to direct delivery of ablation lesions.\n\n## Surgical Procedures: Pacemaker and Defibrillator Implantation and Follow Up\n- Implantation of single and dual chamber pacemakers and defibrillators\n- Implantation of \"biventricular\" pacemakers and defibrillators for patients with congestive heart failure\n- Implantation of loop recorders (implanted ECG recorders for long term monitoring of ECG to allow for diagnosis of an arrhythmia)\n- Clinical follow up and reprogramming of implanted devices\n\n# Abnormalities in Cardiac Electrophysiology\n- Mechanism of Arrhythmias\n- Diseases of the Conduction System and Bradyarrhythmias\n- Narrow Complex Tachycardias\nAtrial Flutter\nAtrial Fibrillation\nAtrial Tachycardia\nAV Nodal Reentrant Tachycardia\nCircus Movement Tachycardia\n- Atrial Flutter\n- Atrial Fibrillation\n- Atrial Tachycardia\n- AV Nodal Reentrant Tachycardia\n- Circus Movement Tachycardia\n- Wide Complex Tachycardias\nWPW Syndrome\nVentricular Tachycardia\nVentricular Tachyarrhythmias in Structurally Normal Hearts\nBrugada Syndrome\nLong QT Syndrome\n- WPW Syndrome\n- Ventricular Tachycardia\nVentricular Tachyarrhythmias in Structurally Normal Hearts\n- Ventricular Tachyarrhythmias in Structurally Normal Hearts\n- Brugada Syndrome\n- Long QT Syndrome\n- Ventricular Tachyarrhythmias, Cardiac Arrest and Sudden Cardiac Death\n- Arrhythmias in Pregnancy\n\n# Treatment Modalities for Arrhythmia\n- Antiarrhythmic Medications\n- Indications for Pacemakers\n- Indications for an ICD\n- Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy\n- Catheter ablation", "source": "wikidoc", "question": "According to an authoritative guideline, discuss the role of electrophysiologic study (EPS) in the investigation and management of arrhythmias and outline how findings from EPS should guide the choice between medical therapy, catheter ablation (distinguishing non‑complex from complex ablation), and device therapy (pacemaker, ICD, or cardiac resynchronization), using clinical scenarios to illustrate decision-making."}

{"guideline_text": "Atovaquone clinical pharmacology\n\n# Clinical Pharmacology\n\n### Pharmacokinetics\nAtovaquone is a highly lipophilic compound with low aqueous solubility. The bioavailability of atovaquone is highly dependent on formulation and diet. The suspension formulation provides an approximately 2-fold increase in atovaquone bioavailability in the fasting or fed state compared to the previously marketed tablet formulation. The absolute bioavailability of a 750-mg dose of MEPRON Suspension administered under fed conditions in 9 HIV-infected (CD4 >100 cells/mm3) volunteers was 47% ± 15%. In the same study, the bioavailability of a 750-mg dose of the previously marketed tablet formulation was 23% ± 11%.\nAdministering atovaquone with food enhances its absorption by approximately 2 fold. In one study, 16 healthy volunteers received a single dose of 750 mg MEPRON Suspension after an overnight fast and following a standard breakfast (23 g fat: 610 kCal). The mean (±SD) area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) values were 324 ± 115 and 801 ± 320 hr●mcg/mL under fasting and fed conditions, respectively, representing a 2.6 ± 1.0-fold increase. The effect of food (23 g fat: 400 kCal) on plasma atovaquone concentrations was also evaluated in a multiple-dose, randomized, crossover study in 19 HIV-infected volunteers (CD4 <200 cells/mm3) receiving daily doses of 500 mg MEPRON Suspension. AUC was 280 ± 114 hr●mcg/mL when atovaquone was administered with food as compared to 169 ± 77 hr●mcg/mL under fasting conditions. Maximum plasma atovaquone concentration (Cmax) was 15.1 ± 6.1 and 8.8 ± 3.7 mcg/mL when atovaquone was administered with food and under fasting conditions, respectively.\nPlasma atovaquone concentrations do not increase proportionally with dose. When MEPRON Suspension was administered with food at dosage regimens of 500 mg once daily, 750 mg once daily, and 1,000 mg once daily, average steady-state plasma atovaquone concentrations were 11.7 ± 4.8, 12.5 ± 5.8, and 13.5 ± 5.1 mcg/mL, respectively. The corresponding Cmax concentrations were 15.1 ± 6.1, 15.3 ± 7.6, and 16.8 ± 6.4 mcg/mL. When MEPRON Suspension was administered to 5 HIV-infected volunteers at a dose of 750 mg twice daily, the average steady-state plasma atovaquone concentration was 21.0 ± 4.9 mcg/mL and Cmax was 24.0 ± 5.7 mcg/mL. The minimum plasma atovaquone concentration (Cmin) associated with the 750-mg twice-daily regimen was 16.7 ± 4.6 mcg/mL.\nFollowing the intravenous administration of atovaquone, the volume of distribution at steady state (Vdss) was 0.60 ± 0.17 L/kg (n = 9). Atovaquone is extensively bound to plasma proteins (99.9%) over the concentration range of 1 to 90 mcg/mL. In 3 HIV-infected children who received 750 mg atovaquone as the tablet formulation 4 times daily for 2 weeks, the cerebrospinal fluid concentrations of atovaquone were 0.04, 0.14, and 0.26 mcg/mL, representing less than 1% of the plasma concentration.\nThe plasma clearance of atovaquone following intravenous (IV) administration in 9 HIV-infected volunteers was 10.4 ± 5.5 mL/min (0.15 ± 0.09 mL/min/kg). The half-life of atovaquone was 62.5 ± 35.3 hours after IV administration and ranged from 67.0 ± 33.4 to 77.6 ± 23.1 hours across studies following administration of MEPRON Suspension. The half-life of atovaquone is long due to presumed enterohepatic cycling and eventual fecal elimination. In a study where 14C-labelled atovaquone was administered to healthy volunteers, greater than 94% of the dose was recovered as unchanged atovaquone in the feces over 21 days. There was little or no excretion of atovaquone in the urine (less than 0.6%). There is indirect evidence that atovaquone may undergo limited metabolism; however, a specific metabolite has not been identified.\nPediatrics\nIn a study of MEPRON Suspension in 27 HIV-infected, asymptomatic infants and children between 1 month and 13 years of age, the pharmacokinetics of atovaquone were age dependent. These patients were dosed once daily with food for 12 days. The average steady-state plasma atovaquone concentrations in the 24 patients with available concentration data are shown in Table 1.\nHepatic/Renal Impairment\nThe pharmacokinetics of atovaquone have not been studied in patients with hepatic or renal impairment.\n\n### Relationship Between Plasma Atovaquone Concentration and Clinical Outcome\nIn a comparative study of atovaquone tablets with TMP-SMX for oral treatment of mild-to-moderate PCP (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE), where AIDS patients received 750 mg atovaquone tablets 3 times daily for 21 days, the mean steady-state atovaquone concentration was 13.9 ± 6.9 mcg/mL (n = 133). Analysis of these data established a relationship between plasma atovaquone concentration and successful treatment. This is shown in Table 2.\nA dosing regimen of MEPRON Suspension for the treatment of mild-to-moderate PCP has been selected to achieve average plasma atovaquone concentrations of approximately 20 mcg/mL, because this plasma concentration was previously shown to be well tolerated and associated with the highest treatment success rates (Table 2). In an open-label PCP treatment study with MEPRON Suspension, dosing regimens of 1,000 mg once daily, 750 mg twice daily, 1,500 mg once daily, and 1,000 mg twice daily were explored. The average steady-state plasma atovaquone concentration achieved at the 750-mg twice-daily dose given with meals was 22.0 ± 10.1 mcg/mL (n = 18).", "source": "wikidoc", "question": "According to authoritative guidelines (wikidoc clinical pharmacology on atovaquone), discuss how you would select formulation, dose and administration advice for an adult with mild-to-moderate Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia to achieve the target plasma atovaquone concentration of ~20 mcg/mL, including the rationale based on bioavailability, the influence of food, choice between once- and twice-daily regimens, expected steady‑state levels, and important limitations or monitoring considerations."}
{"guideline_text": "Allopurinol (patient information)\n\n# Why this medication is prescribed\nAllopurinol is used to treat gout, high levels of uric acid in the body caused by certain cancer medications, and kidney stones. Allopurinol is in a class of medications called xanthine oxidase inhibitors. It works by reducing the production of uric acid in the body. High levels of uric acid may cause gout attacks or kidney stones. Allopurinol is used to prevent gout attacks, not to treat them once they occur.\n\n# How this medication should be used\nAllopurinol comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken once or twice a day, preferably after a meal. To help you remember to take allopurinol, take it around the same time every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take allopurinol exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\nYour doctor will probably start you on a low dose of allopurinol and gradually increase your dose, not more than once a week.\nIt may take several months or longer before you feel the full benefit of allopurinol. Allopurinol may increase the number of gout attacks during the first few months that you take it, although it will eventually prevent attacks. Your doctor may prescribe another medication such as colchicine to prevent gout attacks for the first few months you take allopurinol. Continue to take allopurinol even if you feel well. Do not stop taking allopurinol without talking to your doctor.\n\n# Other uses for this medicine\nAllopurinol is also sometimes used to treat seizures, pain caused by pancreas disease, and certain infections. It is also sometimes used to improve survival after bypass surgery, to reduce ulcer relapses, and to prevent rejection of kidney transplants. Talk to your doctor about the possible risks of using this medication for your condition.\nThis medication may be prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.\n\n# Special Precautions\nBefore taking allopurinol:\n- tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to allopurinol or any other medications.\n- tell your doctor and pharmacist what prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking. Be sure to mention any of the following: amoxicillin (Amoxil, Trimox); ampicillin (Polycillin, Principen); anticoagulants ('blood thinners') such as warfarin (Coumadin); cancer chemotherapy drugs such as cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan) and mercaptopurine (Purinethol); chlorpropamide (Diabinese); diuretics ('water pills'); medications that suppress the immune system such as azathioprine (Imuran) and cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune); other medications for gout such as probenecid (Benemid) and sulfinpyrazone (Anturane); and tolbutamide (Orinase). Your doctor may need to change the doses of your medications or monitor you carefully for side effects.\n- tell your doctor if you have or have ever had kidney or liver disease or heart failure.\n- tell your doctor if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breast-feeding. If you become pregnant while taking allopurinol, call your doctor.\n- you should know that allopurinol may make you drowsy. Do not drive a car or operate machinery until you know how this medication affects you.\n- ask your doctor about the safe use of alcoholic beverages while you are taking allopurinol. Alcohol may decrease the effectiveness of allopurinol.\n\n# Special dietary instructions\nDrink at least eight glasses of water or other fluids each day while taking allopurinol unless directed to do otherwise by your doctor.\n\n# What to do if you forget a dose\nTake the missed dose as soon as you remember it. However, if it is almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and continue your regular dosing schedule. Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed one.\n\n# Side Effects\n\n## Minor Side Effects\nAllopurinol may cause side effects. Tell your doctor if any of these symptoms are severe or do not go away:\n- upset stomach\n- diarrhea\n- drowsiness\n\n## Severe Side Effects\nSome side effects can be serious. The following symptoms are uncommon, but if you experience any of them, call your doctor immediately:\n- skin rash\n- painful urination\n- blood in the urine\n- irritation of the eyes\n- swelling of the lips or mouth\n- fever, sore throat, chills, and other signs of infection\n- loss of appetite\n- unexpected weight loss\n- itching\nAllopurinol may cause other side effects. Call your doctor if you have any unusual problems while taking this medication.\nIf you experience a serious side effect, you or your doctor may send a report to the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) MedWatch Adverse Event Reporting program online  or by phone .\n\n# Storage conditions needed for this medication\nKeep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). Throw away any medication that is outdated or no longer needed. Talk to your pharmacist about the proper disposal of your medication.\n\n# Other information\nKeep all appointments with your doctor and the laboratory. Your doctor will order certain lab tests to check your body's response to allopurinol.\nDo not let anyone else take your medication. Ask your pharmacist any questions you have about refilling your prescription.\n\n# Brand names\n- Aloprim®\n- Zyloprim®", "source": "wikidoc", "question": "According to authoritative patient-information guidelines, discuss how you would evaluate, initiate and manage allopurinol therapy in an adult with gout — including the indications for starting treatment, initial dosing and up-titration strategy, need for short‑term prophylaxis against gout flares, key drug interactions and comorbid conditions that alter management, essential monitoring and actions for minor versus severe adverse effects (including when to stop treatment and report events), and the specific patient counselling points you would provide about dosing, missed doses, fluid intake, pregnancy/breastfeeding, driving, alcohol, storage, and follow‑up."}

It may also be a finding in malignancy with the non-bacterial non-thrombotic involvement of the valves, most commonly the aortic and mitral valve. The most common complications include embolic phenomenon like cerebrovascular disease and infective endocarditis with valvular insufficeincy. The disease activity and titer of the antibodies in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus can be linked to Libman-sack Endocarditis.\n\n## HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVES:\nLibman and Sack in 1924, first coined this term for the sterile verrucous vegetations of the mitral and aortic valves in four patients in New York.\n\n## PATHOPHYSIOLOGY:\nEndothelial dysfunction and hypercoagulable state are the two most important events in the process of non-thrombotic non-bacterial endocarditis (NTBE), that lead to vegetation formation on the valves . In Systemic Lupus erythematosus and other autoimmune conditions, the formation of autoantibodies may damage he native valves creating a nidus for the formation of vegetation the vegetations can be small (less than 1mm), histopathologically consisting of fibrin, platelets thrombi, mono-nuclear cells and immune complexes.\n\n## ETIOLOGY:\nThe major phenomenon involved in the etiology of Lib-man sack endocarditis are Systemic Lupus Erythematosus, Malignancy and Antiphospholipid syndrome. The prevalence of NTBE in malignancy is reported to be 1.25% as compared to 0.25% in general population, among which 2.7% is accounted for by the solid organ malignancies. About 33% prevalence is recorded in patients with either primary or secondary anti-phospholipid syndrome. A significant correlation of 6% to 11% exists between lupus findings and NTBE.\n\n# Reference\n- ↑ Carrillo-Esper R, Carrillo-Córdova JR, Carrillo-Córdova LD, Carrillo-Córdova CA (2010). \"\".

The term embraces the imperfect fungi of the genera Epidermophyton, Microsporum and Trichophyton.\nDermatophytes (name based on the Greek for 'skin plants') are a common label for a group of three types of fungus that commonly causes skin disease in animals and humans. These anamorphic (asexual or imperfect) genera are: Microsporum, Epidermophyton and Trichophyton.  There are about 40 species in these three genera.  Species capable of reproducing sexually belong in the teleomorphic genus, Arthroderma, of the Ascomycota.  (See Teleomorph, anamorph and holomorph for more information on this type of fungal life cycle).\nDermatophytes cause infections of the skin, hair and nails due to their ability to obtain nutrients from keratinized material. The organisms colonize the keratin tissues and inflammation is caused by host response to metabolic by-products. They are usually restricted to the nonliving cornified layer of the epidermis because of their inability to penetrate viable tissue of an immunocompetent host.  Invasion does elicit a host response ranging from mild to severe. Acid proteinases, elastase, keratinases, and other proteinases reportedly act as virulence factors. The development of cell-mediated immunity correlated with delayed hypersensitivity and an inflammatory response is associated with clinical cure, whereas the lack of or a defective cell-mediated immunity predisposes the host to chronic or recurrent dermatophyte infection.\nSome of these infections are known as ringworm or tinea. Toe- and fingernail infection are referred to as onychomycosis. Dermatophytes usually do not invade living tissues, but colonize the outer layer of the skin. Occasionally the organisms do invade subcutaneous tissues, resulting in kerion development.\n\n# Identification\nMicroscopic morphology of the micro and macroconidia is the most reliable identification character, but a good slide preparation is needed, and also needed is the stimulation of sporulation in some strains.  Culture characteristics such as surface texture, topography and pigmentation are variable so they are the least reliable criteria for identification.  Clinical information such as the appearance of the lesion, site, geographic location, travel history, animal contacts and race is also important, especially in identifying rare non-sporulating species like Trichophyton concentricum, Microsporum audouinii and Trichophyton schoenleinii.\n\n# Transmission\nDermatophytes are transmitted by direct contact with infected host (human or animal) or by direct or indirect contact with infected exfoliated skin or hair in clothing, combs, hair brushes, theatre seats, caps, furniture, bed linens, towels, hotel rugs, and locker room floors.  Depending on the species the organism may be viable in the environment for up to 15 months. There is an increased susceptibility to infection when there is a preexisting injury to the skin such as scars, burns, excessive temperature and humidity.  Adaptation to growth o­n humans by most geophilic species resulted in diminished loss of sporulation, sexuality, and other soil-associated characteristics.\n\n# Classification\nDermatophytes are classified as anthropophilic (humans), zoophilic (animals) or geophilic (soil) according to their normal habitat.\n- Anthropophilic dermatophytes are restricted to human hosts and produce a mild, chronic inflammation.\n- Zoophilic organisms are found primarily in animals and cause marked inflammatory reactions in humans who have contact with infected cats, dogs, cattle, horses, birds, or other animals. This is followed by a rapid termination of the infection.\n- Geophilic species are usually recovered from the soil but occasionally infect humans and animals. They cause a marked inflammatory reaction, which limits the spread of the infection and may lead to a spontaneous cure but may also leave scars.\n\n# Classification\n- About 58% of the dermatophyte species isolated are Trichophyton rubrum\n- 27% are T. mentagrophytes\n- 7% are T. verrucosum\n- 3% are T. tonsurans\n- Infrequently isolated (less than 1%) are Epidermophyton floccosum, Microsporum audouinii, M. canis, M. equinum, M. nanum, M. versicolor, Trichophyton equinum, T. kanei, T. raubitschekii, and T. violaceum.\n\n# Medications\n- Lamisil\n- Tea tree oil", "source": "wikidoc", "question": "According to an authoritative guideline, discuss how you would diagnose, classify, and manage a suspected dermatophyte infection in an adult patient, addressing: (a) the clinical and laboratory methods to identify the organism and their relative reliability; (b) how species classification (anthropophilic, zoophilic, geophilic) and host immune response influence prognosis and expected inflammatory pattern; (c) practical measures to prevent transmission in the patient and household; and (d) first‑line treatment options and factors that would guide your choice between them."}
{"guideline_text": "Dixmont State Hospital\nDixmont State Hospital (originally the Department of the Insane in the Western Pennsylvania Hospital of Pittsburgh) was a hospital located northwest of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Construction Began in 1859, and Opened in 1862 and was in fact not named in honour of Dorothea Dix but Dix allowed the name only as a memory to her grandfather. It closed in 1984. The Western Pennsylvania Hospital at Pittsburgh ended its first year of operation in 1853, and it was evident that there were a greater amount of patients in jails and almshouses than could be provided for in the 26 beds designated for that express purpose at the hospital. Managers of the hospital used a $10,000 appropriation from the state to purchase a large amount of farmland, on a hill overlooking the Ohio River, to the south of Pittsburgh. The land lay in what is now the Kilbuck/ Emsworth Twp areas. They originally wanted to build the institution in the city, but this idea was rejected by Dorothea Dix. The facility was named Dixmont, but Dix allowed the name only as a memory to her grandfather, not in honor of herself.\nA grand ceremony took place on July 19, 1859, when the cornerstone of the Dixmont Kirkbride building was lain in the foundation. A glass jar was placed in the cornerstone, containing numerous objects, papers, and a letter from Dorothea Dix herself. Also contained was a copy of her 1845 \"Memorial\", the 55 page county by county study of the conditions for the mentally ill in Pennsylvania, which had a great part in jump starting early mental health care reform in Pennsylvania. Unfortunately, the time capsule was recently recovered, only to find it had broken, and most of the contents were unrecognizable.\nThe Kirkbride building at Dixmont was typical of other Kirkbride facilities with the exception that the outermost wings swept forward instead of to the rear in the typical V-shape. This was to afford a better view of the river valley, and better airflow, which was said to be more calming to the patients, in keeping with the want of a serene setting. It had gas lighting, a central hot air system for heat, and more than ample supply of water from the Ohio River. Construction of the west wing was not complete until 1868, at which time construction of the east wing began. It was named Reed Hall, after the first superintendent of Dixmont, Dr Joseph A. Reed. Behind the Reed Hall, was the Dietary Building. This building contained the main kitchen at Dixmont, the large freezers, and storage areas where food was kept. Also part of this building were the loading docks, cleaning supplies, and upstairs were the auditorium, and the cafeteria. To the right of Reed Hall, was the Mens Annex, which housed many of the patients who were trusted with work details in he further reaches of the property, which would reach a size of approx. 407 acres. To the left of Reed Hall was the gym.\nOther buildings on the property included the Hutchinson Building, which was the infirmary of the hospital. In this building you could find intensive care, x-ray facilities, a small cafeteria, a barber shop, isolation units, physical therapy areas, and observation rooms, instrument sterilization equipment. Each floor had patient rooms on the ends of the building, surrounding a nurses pod, all separated by half glass walls so the nurses could easily observe all of the patients easily. Also in this building, were the morgue, laboratory, and autopsy. This building is where electroshock therapy, lobotomies, and other medical procedures. The Cammarrata Building was built in the early 1950's. This building was the geriatric center of Dixmont. This building has been renovated and is currently home (yet again coincidentally) to the a foundation for the disabled (The Verland Foundation) a private school, (The Glen Montessori School) and offices for the construction company owned by the family that purchased the property\nDixmont State Hospital was originally named the Department of the Insane in the Western Pennsylvania Hospital of Pittsburgh. The original patient population of the hospital was a meager 113 patients, who were transferred from the Western Pennsylvania Hospital in Pittsburgh. Before the 1800's were out, somewhere between 1,200 and 1,500 patients called the hospital home. In 1907, the facility was individually incorporated as the Dixmont Hospital for the Insane after separating from the Western Pennsylvania Hospital system. Dixmont was completely self sustained from the beginning. It had it's own farmlands, livestock, rail station, and post office. Also part of the facility was a water treatment plant, a sewage treatment plant, and electricity generating facilities. They had their own butchers, bakers, farmhands, electricians, laborers, pipe fitters, botanists, chefs, and even a barber and a dentist.Time and many fires (one that completely gutted the Administration Building) had left the crumbling building useless, and demolition began 2005. Walmart had bought the land, and planned to build on it, until a landslide caused by excavation, ended up covering PA Route 65 and railroad tracks on the otherside, shutting them both down for weeks.  After numerous complaints by Kilbuck Township residents for fear of another collapse, due to the unstability of the \"rebuilt\" landslide, Wal-mart decided not to build on the property on September 26, 2007.", "source": "wikidoc", "question": "According to the authoritative guideline provided on Dixmont State Hospital, discuss how the hospital’s architectural features, staffing model and self-sustaining services (including the Kirkbride layout and wing orientation, emphasis on airflow and river views, nurses’ pods and half-glass observation walls, work annexes and occupational roles, and on-site infirmary and treatment facilities) were intended to support psychiatric patient care and rehabilitation, and analyze the likely advantages and disadvantages of these design elements for patient observation, treatment delivery, and long-term outcomes."}

{"guideline_text": "Gamma-Linolenic acid\n\n# Overview\nGamma-linolenic acid or GLA (γ-Linolenic acid), (INN and USAN gamolenic acid) is a fatty acid found primarily in vegetable oils.  It is sold as a dietary supplement for a variety of human health problems, although there is little or no evidence of its effectiveness. However when acting on GLA, 5-lipoxygenase produces no leukotrienes and the conversion by the enzyme of arachidonic acid to leukotrienes is inhibited.\n\n# Chemistry\nGLA is categorized as an n−6 (also called ω−6 or omega-6) fatty acid, meaning that the first double bond on the methyl end (designated with n or ω) is the sixth bond. In physiological literature, GLA is designated as 18:3 (n−6). GLA is a carboxylic acid with an 18-carbon chain and three cis double bonds. It is an isomer of α-linolenic acid, which is a polyunsaturated n−3 (omega-3) fatty acid, found in rapeseed canola oil, soy beans, walnuts, flax seed (linseed oil), perilla, chia, and hemp seed.\n\n# History\nGLA was first isolated from the seed oil of evening primrose.  This herbal plant was grown by Native Americans to treat swelling in the body.\nIn the 17th century, it was introduced to Europe and became a popular folk remedy, earning the name king's cure-all.\nin 1919, Heiduschka and Lüft extracted the oil from evening primrose seeds and described an unusual linolenic acid, which they name γ-.\nLater, the exact chemical structure was characterized by Riley.\nAlthough there are α- and γ- forms of linolenic acid, there is no β- form.  One was once identified, but it turned out to be an artifact of the original analytical process.\n\n# Dietary sources\nGLA is obtained from vegetable oils such as evening primrose (Oenothera biennis) oil (EPO), blackcurrant seed oil, borage seed oil, and hemp seed oil. GLA is also found in varying amounts in edible hemp seeds, oats, barley, and  spirulina. Normal safflower (Carthamus tinctorius) oil does not contain GLA, but a genetically modified GLA safflower oil available in commercial quantities since 2011 contains 40% GLA. Borage oil contains 20% GLA, evening primrose oil ranges from 8% to 10% GLA, and black-currant oil contains 15-20%.\nThe human body produces GLA from linoleic acid (LA). This reaction is catalyzed by Δ6-desaturase (D6D), an enzyme that allows the creation of a double bond on the sixth carbon counting from the carboxyl terminus.  LA is consumed sufficiently in most diets, from such abundant sources as cooking oils and meats. However, a lack of GLA can occur when there is a reduction of the efficiency of the D6D conversion (for instance, as people grow older or when there are specific dietary deficiencies) or in disease states wherein there is excessive consumption of GLA metabolites.\n\n# Source of eicosanoids\nFrom GLA, the body forms dihomo-γ-linolenic acid (DGLA). This is one of the body's three sources of eicosanoids (along with AA and EPA.) DGLA is the precursor of the prostaglandin PGH1, which in turn forms PGE1 and the thromboxane TXA1. Both PGE11 and TXA1 are anti-inflammatory; thromboxane TXA1, unlike its series-2 variant, induces vasodilation, and inhibits platelet consequently, TXA1 modulates (reduces) the pro-inflammatory properties of the thromboxane TXA2. PGE1 has a role in regulation of immune system function and is used as the medicine alprostadil.\nUnlike AA and EPA, DGLA cannot yield leukotrienes.  However it can inhibit the formation of pro-inflammatory leukotrienes from AA.\nAlthough GLA is an n−6 fatty acid, a type of acid that is, in general, pro-inflammatory, it has anti-inflammatory properties. (See discussion at Essential fatty acid interactions: The paradox of dietary GLA.)\n\n# Health and medicine\nGLA has been promoted as medication for a variety of ailments including breast pain and eczema, in particular by David Horrobin (1939 – 2003), whose marketing of evening primrose oil was described by the British Medical Journal (BMJ) as ethically dubious – the substance was likely to be remembered as \"a remedy for which there is no disease\". \nIn 2002 the UK's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency withdrew marketing authorisations for evening primrose oil as an eczema remedy. The BMJ commented in 2003 that it had taken 20 years to demonstrate that the substance was of no use in atopic dermatitis, and called for more transparency in the research on which drug licensing decisions were taken.\nGLA is also sometimes promoted as an anti-cancer agent. According to the American Cancer Society there is very little evidence for its effectiveness, and \"neither GLA nor other GLA-rich supplements (such as evening primrose oil) have been convincingly shown to be useful in preventing or treating any other health conditions.\"\n\n## Side effects\nMeta-analysis by the Cochrane Collaboration reported some evidence of mild and temporary side-effects for trial participants with either product or placebo, including temporary headache and upset stomach or diarrhea. With evening primrose oil (EPO) there was an anticoagulant (blood-thinning) effect. There is a warning with the blood thinner warfarin that taking EPO can increase bleeding. One report warns that if EPO is taken for more than one year there is a potential risk of inflammation, thrombosis, and immunosuppression due to slow accumulation of EPO in the tissues. Another report involves a single case in which EPO was thought to have produced harm, but no clinical evidence of such harm was found in short-term trials.\n\n# Notes and references\n- ↑ Jump up to: 1.0 1.1 Cochrane Collaboration meta-analysis: Oral evening primrose oil and borage oil for eczema.

{"guideline_text": "Aspergillus clavatus\n\n# Overview\nAspergillus clavatus is a species of Aspergillus with conidia dimensions 3-4.5 x 2.5-4.5 micrometres. It is found in soil and animal manure.\nCan produce the toxin patulin which may be associated with disease in humans and animals.\nThis species is only occasionally pathogenic. This agent has been implicated in Hypersensitivity pneumonitis.\nHypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) is not a single disease but is a complex syndrome of varying intensity, clinical presentation, and natural history.\nThe syndrome was first described in Iceland in 1874 and termed heykatarr. The syndrome is caused by sensitization to repeated inhalation of dusts containing one of 300 organic antigens. These organic dusts come from a wide variety of sources but most commonly include:\n- Dairy and grain products\n- Animal dander and protein\n- Wood bark\n- Water reservoir vaporizers\nThe two most common antigens are:\n- Thermophilic actinomycetes and\n- Avian proteins\nAs a rseult of exposure to thee antigens, the two most common causes (i.e. diseases) are:\n- Farmer's lung and\n- Bird fancier's lung\nPathologically, the HP syndrome is associated with diffuse inflammation of lung parenchyma and airways.\nBased on the length and intensity of exposure and subsequent duration of illness, there are 3 clinical presentations of HP:\n- Acute\n- Subacute (intermittent)\n- Chronic progressive\nSynonyms and related keywords: hypersensitivity pneumonitis, HP, bird fancier's lung, extrinsic allergic alveolitis, farmer's lung, Saccharopolyspora rectivirgula, S rectivirgula, Micropolyspora faeni, M faeni, Thermoactinomyces sacchari, T sacchari, Thermoactinomyces vulgaris, T vulgaris, Penicillium casei, P casei, Aspergillus clavatus, A clavatus, Mucor stolonifer, M stolonifer, Sitophilus granarius, S granarius, Cladosporium, heykatarr, bagassosis, grain handler's lung, humidifier lung, air-conditioner lung, bird breeder's lung, cheese worker's lung, malt worker's lung, paprika splitter's lung, mollusk shell hypersensitivity, chemical worker's lung, pulmonary disease, lung disease.\n\n# Epidemiology and Demographics\n- The prevalence of HP varies significantly by region, climate, occupation/exposure and farming practices.\n- Farmers:\nUS: 8-540 cases per 100,000 persons per year among those at risk\nUK: 420-3000 cases per 100,000 persons per year among those at risk\nFrance: 4370 cases per 100,000 persons per year among those at risk\nFinland: 1400-1700 cases per 100,000 persons per year among those at risk\n- US: 8-540 cases per 100,000 persons per year among those at risk\n- UK: 420-3000 cases per 100,000 persons per year among those at risk\n- France: 4370 cases per 100,000 persons per year among those at risk\n- Finland: 1400-1700 cases per 100,000 persons per year among those at risk\n- Pigeon Breeders: 6000-21,000 cases per 100,000 persons per year\n- Bird Fanciers: 20-20,000 cases per 100,000 persons per year\n- Attack rates vary considerably, but can be high in sporadic outbreaks. For example a large proportion (52%) of office workers exposed to an infected humidifier were affected in one outbreak, and in another outbreak 27% of workers at a molding plant for polyurethane foam parts were affected.\n- The male to female ratio is approximately 1.2:1.\n- The mean age of the patients with HP is 61 ± 0.7 years (epidemiologic data from Spain).\n\n# Risk Factors\nThe following is a partial list of occupations and major causative antigens that put a patient at risk of HP:\n- Farmers and cattle workers: These workers develop the most common form of HP which is caused by the antigen thermophilic actinomycetes.  It is important to note that while Farmer's lung is the most common cause of HP, it still must be distinguished from febrile toxic reactions to inhaled mold dusts (organic dust toxic syndrome, a nonimmunologic reaction) which occurs 30-50 times more often than HP.\n- Poultry and other bird handlers: These workers are exposed to droppings, feathers, and serum proteins of pigeons and other birds.\n- Ventilation workers and those exposed to water-related contamination: These workers may be exposed to microorganisms thatcolonize humidifiers, forced-air systems, hot tubs, whirlpools, and spas. The putative antigens are derived from Thermoactinomyces or Cladosporium.\n- Veterinarians and animal handlers: These workers obviously have daily contact with a large variety of animals and organic antigens.\n- Grain and flour processors and loaders: These workers are exposed to grain. Grain can become colonized with a variety of microorganisms and their antigens.\n- Lumber mill workers and paper and wallboard manufacturers: These workers are exposed to wood which can become colonized with molds and then becomes aerosolized.\n- Plastic manufacturers, painters, and electronics industry workers: These workers can be exposed to  diphenylmethane diisocyanate or toluene diisocyanate.\n- Textile workers: These workers do develop lung injury but this is not a true form of HP. The injury is characterized by diffuse alveolar damage or airway dysfunction and includes diseases such as byssinosis and nylon worker's lung.\n\n# Pathophysiology & Etiology\n\n## Pathologic Findings\n\n### Acute HP\nThere are noncaseating interstitial granulomas and mononuclear cell infiltration in a peribronchial distribution. Giant cells are prominent.\n\n### Subacute or intermittent HP\nThe noncaseating granulomas are more well formed.  There is bronchiolitis with or without organizing pneumonia. Interstitial fibrosis is present.\n\n### Chronic HP\nThere is chronic interstitial inflammation and alveolar destruction (honeycombing). There is dense fibrosis.  The pathologic findings of chronic HP that are often associated with a poorer prognosis include the following 3 patterns of fibrosis:\n- Predominantly peripheral fibrosis: in a patchy pattern with architectural distortion and fibroblast foci similar to usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP)\n- Homogeneous linear fibrosis: similar to fibrotic nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP)\n- Irregular predominantly peribronchiolar fibrosis\n\n## Pathophysiology of Immune Response\nExposure results in the development of circulating immunoglobulin G antibodies that are specific for the offending antigen. This antibody that forms is called the precipitating antibody, and it reacts with the specific putative antigen to form a precipitant.  Initially the disease process was thought to be immunecomplex-mediated. However, subsequent studies have demonstrated that cell-mediated immunity is more important.\nIn the acute phase, there is a local increase in neutrophils in the alveoli and small airways. This is followed by an influx of mononuclear cells which release proteolytic enzymes, prostaglandins, and leukotrienes.\n\n# Natural History\n- In general, the majority of patients recover completely after the inciting exposure ceases.\n- The prognosis of Bird Fancier's Disease is worse than Farmer's Lung.\n- Other varieties of HP have more variable outcomes.\n\n# Diagnosis\n\n## The 6 Diagnostic Criteria for Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis (HP)\nWhen combined with the appropriate epidemiologic data and in areas of high prevalence, these criteria can establish the diagnosis of HP without the need for bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) or biopsy (Lacasse, 2003).\n- Exposure to a known offending antigen\n- Positive precipitating antibodies to the offending antigen\n- Recurrent episodes of symptoms\n- Inspiratory crackles on physical examination\n- Symptoms occurring 4-8 hours after exposure\n- Weight loss\n\n## Conditions That Can Mimic HP\nOther diseases that are secondary to inhalation of organic agents but are not true forms of HP are as follows:\n- Inhalation fever: Patients present with fever, chills, headache, and myalgias however there are not pulmonary findings (although mild dyspnea may occur). Onset is 4-8 hours following exposure.  There are no long-term sequelae occur.\n- Organic dust toxic syndrome: This syndrome is the result of exposure to bioaerosols contaminated with toxin-producing fungi (mycotoxins). Patients present with fever, chills, and myalgias 4-6 hours after exposure. In contrast to inhalation fever, the chest X ray may show diffuse opacities. Bronchiolitis or diffuse alveolar damage may be present on lung biopsy specimens. This is not a true form of HP because no prior sensitization is required.\n- Chronic bronchitis: This can result from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, which is the most common respiratory syndrome among agricultural workers. The prevalence of chronic bronchitis is much higher  at 10%, compared with 1.4% for HP.\n- Exposure to aerosolized Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC): A hypersensitivity pneumonitis like syndrome has been described in patients exposed to aerosolized Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC). Hot tub lung is a term used to describe these hypersensitivity pneumonitis-like cases because they have generally been associated with hot tub use. The syndrome has been linked to the high levels of infectious aerosols containing MAC organisms found in the water. Whether this syndrome represents a true MAC infection or classic HP remains controversial (Marras, 2005).\n\n## Differential Diagnosis\nBy frequency of Interstitial Lung Diseases (Xaubet, 2004):\n- Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (38.6%)\n- Sarcoidosis (14.9%)\n- Cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (10.4%)\n- Interstitial lung disease associated with collagen vascular diseases (9.9%)\n- Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis (HP) (6.6%)\n- Unclassified (5.1%)\nIn alphabetical order:\nAir-conditioner lung\nAspergillus clavatus\nBagassosis\nBird breeder's lung\nBird fancier's lung\nCheese worker's lung\nChemical worker's lung\nCladosporium\nFarmer's lung\nGrain handler's lung\nHumidifier lung\nMalt worker's lung\nMicropolyspora faeni\nMollusk shell hypersensitivity\nMucor stolonifer\nPaprika splitter's lung\nPenicillium casei\nSaccharopolyspora rectivirgula\nSitophilus granarius\nThermoactinomyces sacchari\nThermoactinomyces vulgaris\n\n## History and Symptoms\nHistory: The clinical presentation of HP is categorized as acute, subacute, or chronic, according to duration of illness.\n\n### Acute HP\n- Symptoms develop 4-6 hours following exposure to the inciting agent and then generally resolve spontaneously within 12 hours to several days upon removal of the inciting agent.\n- Symptoms include the abrupt development of\nfever\nchills\nmalaise\ncough\nchest tightness\ndyspnea\nheadache\nmalaise.\n- fever\n- chills\n- malaise\n- cough\n- chest tightness\n- dyspnea\n- headache\n- malaise.\n\n### Subacute or Iintermittent HP\n- Symptoms include the gradual development of\nproductive cough\ndyspnea\nfatigue\nanorexia\nweight loss\n- productive cough\n- dyspnea\n- fatigue\n- anorexia\n- weight loss\n- The same symptoms may be present in patients who experience acute attacks on multiple occasions.\nPatients with subacute HP present similarly to patients with acute disease, but symptoms are less severe and last longer.\n\n### Chronic HP\nPatients often lack a history of acute episodes.\nThey have an insidious onset of cough, progressive dyspnea, fatigue, and weight loss.\nRemoving exposure results in only partial improvement.\n\n## Physical Examination\nIn general, the signs of acute, subacute and chronic forms of the disease are similar except patients with the chronic form may have clubbing, weight loss and muscle wasting.\n\n### Appearance of the Patient\nWeight loss is present in the chronic form of the syndrome.\n\n### Vital Signs\nFever and tachypnea are often present.\n\n### Lungs\nDiffuse fine bibasilar crackles\n\n### Extremities\nClubbing is observed in 50% of patients with the chronic form of the syndrome.\nMuscle wasting is also observed in the chronic form of the syndrome.\n\n## Laboratory Findings\n\n### Chest X Ray\n\n### Other Imaging Findings\n\n## Other Diagnostic Studies\nA test to assess for precipitating antibodies to the offending antigen will be positive.\n\n# Risk Stratification and Prognosis\n- In general, the majority of patients recover completely after the inciting exposure ceases.\n- The prognosis of Bird Fancier's Disease is worse than Farmer's Lung.\n- Other varieties of HP have more variable outcomes.\n\n# Treatment\n\n## Pharmacotherapy\n\n### Acute Pharmacotherapies\n\n### Chronic Pharmacotherapies\n\n## Primary Prevention\n\n## Secondary Prevention", "source": "wikidoc", "question": "According to authoritative guidelines, discuss the diagnostic evaluation and differentiation of hypersensitivity pneumonitis due to Aspergillus clavatus, addressing: the key exposure history and timing of symptoms, the six diagnostic criteria and their application without BAL/biopsy, the role of precipitating antibodies, the typical clinical and pathological features of acute, subacute and chronic presentations, and how to distinguish this condition from inhalation fever, organic dust toxic syndrome and other common mimics."}
{"guideline_text": "kappa Opioid receptor\nThe κ-Opioid receptors are a class of opioid receptors with dynorphins as the primary endogenous ligands, and ketazocine as a potent selective exogenous ligand. There are three variants: κ1, κ2, and κ3. The κ-opioid receptor mediates the action of the dissociative hallucinogenic drug and highly selective agonist salvinorin A and the hallucinogenic side effects of opioids such as pentazocine.\n\n# Effects\nIt has long been believed that kappa-opioid receptor agonists are dysphoric. This misconception traces back to early articles in the 1980s about human tests with κ-opioid receptor agonists. It was stated that:\n\"Both doses of ketocyclazocine substantially elevated scores on the LSD subscale of the ARCI as did the high dose of cyclazocine (fig. 2C). Morphine failed to increase scores significantly on this scale which measures dysphoria.\"\nIt is now widely accepted that κ-opioid receptor (partial) agonists have hallucinogenic (\"psychotomimetic\") effects, as exemplified by salvinorin A. These effects are generally undesirable in medicinal drugs and could have had frightening or disturbing effects in the tested humans, but they are not per se dysphoric. It is thought that the hallucinogenic effects of drugs such as butorphanol, nalbuphine, and pentazocine serve to limit their opiate abuse potential. In the case of salvinorin A, a structurally novel neoclerodane diterpene κ-opioid receptor agonist, these hallucinogenic effects are sought after.  While salvinorin A is considered a hallucinogen, its effects are qualitatively different than those produced by the classical psychedelic hallucinogens such as LSD or mescaline.\nActivation of the κ-opioid receptor appears to antagonize many of the effects of the μ opioid receptor.\nKappa ligands are also known for their characteristic diuretic effects, due to their negative regulation of antidiuretic hormone (ADH).\nKappa agonism is neuroprotective against hypoxia/ischemia; as such, kappa receptors may represent a novel therapeutic target.\n\n# Location\nκ receptors are located in the periphery by pain neurons, in the spinal cord and in the brain.\n\n# Reversal\nNon-specific opioid receptor antagonists (e.g., naloxone) as well as the mixed opioid agonist/antagonist buprenorphine can be used to reverse the effects of kappa agonists.", "source": "wikidoc", "question": "According to authoritative guidelines, discuss the pharmacologic profile of κ-opioid receptor agonists (including endogenous ligands, location, characteristic physiological effects such as psychotomimetic/hallucinogenic phenomena, diuresis, antagonism of μ-opioid effects, and potential neuroprotective actions), and explain how these properties should inform clinical decision-making about therapeutic use, patient selection, monitoring for adverse effects, and the acute management and reversal of kappa agonist toxicity."}

In some cases, measurements completed as part of the acceptance procedures may also serve as components in establishing the routine quality assurance program. The vendor must demonstrate acceptable system performance.\n\n## 4.b | commissioning\nTo determine the scope of SRS-SBRT commissioning, the QMP must understand the scope of procedures/services to be offered. Commissioning encompasses the overall process of validating the planning and delivery system for the services to be offered, and developing appropriate QC and technical procedures to support these services.\nThe scope of commissioning must therefore be commensurate with the scope of clinical services to be offered.\n\n## 4.b.1 | equipment commissioning\nCommissioning of a linac-based treatment delivery system is performed after acceptance testing. Commissioning tests should be developed by the institution's medical physics team to explore in detail every aspect of the system with the goal of developing a comprehensive baseline characterization of the performance of the system, identifying any limitations relative to clinical use, and developing procedures for QA and clinical use. 10,11 A variety of task group reports are referenced in this document to provide guidance on best practice for performing commissioning and QA of delivery devices. However, SRS-SBRT intent requires special consideration.\nEach SRS-SBRT system is highly specialized with fixed cones and/or multileaf collimators (MLCs). Specific validation should be considered based on manufacturer recommendations and the determined scope of the practice. Commissioning of such systems includes, but is not limited to, a safety and geometric accuracy evaluation of the treatment and imaging components, comprehensive small-field data measurement with appropriate stereotactic detectors and careful equipment setup, evaluation of treatment planning system capabilities including multimodality image processing and calculation accuracy for small fields, and the development of a comprehensive QA program for each of the following critical components:\n1.

An important characteristic of any detector used for commissioning is that the detector's active area be of a small size compared to the field size range to be characterized.

The following section is consistent with the TG 101 recommendations, providing additional details deemed relevant to a clinical SRS-SBRT program.\n\n## Treatment planning system\n\n## Standard operating procedures\nSite-specific SOPs should address the components essential to the patient review, simulation, planning, treatment, and follow-up (see the Appendix for a sample SOP document). Patient safety should be the primary consideration when developing any SOP. c. The SOP should establish certain process expectations for safe implementation such as appropriate time intervals from simulation to treatment with critical points along the path allowing for reconsideration or rescheduling.\nd. Every team member has the right and responsibility to halt a case and/or a particular procedure based on safety imperatives.\n\n## Patient selection\na.

Where possible, a multidisciplinary review or a peer review of proposed cases should be completed prior to simulation.\nIf the patient is enrolled in a clinical trial, the rules and guidelines of the clinical trial must be followed. e. In cases of re-irradiation, the cumulative dose should be evaluated by the treating physician. A description of the method used and the outcome of the evaluation should be documented.\nf. The use of an isotropic calculation grid size of 2 mm or finer is recommended. The use of a grid size >3 mm is discouraged.

Target dose coverage, dose fall-off beyond the target, dose conformity metrics, and compliance with critical structure dose objectives 32 should be clearly reported and signed by the radiation oncologist to confirm that the chosen treatment technique is clinically acceptable.\nh. An independent dose calculation check must be performed prior to treatment. b. The SOP should clearly describe the professional supervision requirements for each SRS-SBRT treatment type.

If motion management is used, the SOP should clearly describe the process, tolerances, and professional supervision.\n\n## Treatment delivery\n\n## End-to-end (e2e) testing\nTo assess the clinical team's readiness and to validate the SOP, the team should conduct \"dry runs\" of the entire process, observe and take notes, edit the SOP as needed, and repeat the E2E testing until the process is clear to all participants. The pre-implementation E2E tests and findings should be described in the commissioning report.\nEach step in the E2E testing should be performed by the staff member who will perform the step when the program is clinically implemented. E2E process \"dry runs\" should be performed for each category of SRS-SBRT service, and when a key aspect of the process is changed.\nWhen developing the E2E tests, all aspects of the treatment process should be considered, including immobilization, simulation, respiratory management, treatment planning, and treatment delivery using a clinically relevant image guidance method.\n\n## | quality assurance\n\n# 5.a | introduction\nA comprehensive QA program for SRS-SBRT is critical to ensure the correct dose is delivered to the target, given the very small target volumes and rapid dose fall-off associated with SRS-SBRT. QA processes and procedures related to SRS-SBRT should be designed to cover the follow-ing aspects of the SRS-SBRT program: equipment-specific QA, patientspecific QA, and procedure-specific QA. Safety and QA recommendations have been extensively described in several publications. [bib_ref] Stereotactic body radiation therapy: the report of AAPM Task Group 101, Benedict [/bib_ref] When equipment performance is found to be out of tolerance, the affected module(s) of the delivery system should be promptly adjusted, and the QMP should verify proper performance before clinical SRS-SBRT services resume. In the event of a significant service interruption, the QMP should coordinate closely with treating physicians to evaluate the impact on patients' treatment schedules given the importance of completing SRS-SBRT treatment courses in a short overall time interval (generally 14 days or less).Patient safety should be the primary consideration in determining when to resume clinical services.\n\n## 5.b | minimum equipment-specific qa\nThe AAPM has published task group reports with recommendations for QA related to SRS-SBRT. TG-142 describes the linear accelerator QA for both conventional radiation therapy procedures and for SRS-SBRT procedures. 36 MPPG 2.a provides recommendations for commissioning and quality assurance of X-ray-based image-guided radiotherapy systems. [bib_ref] AAPM medical physics practice guideline 2.a: commissioning and quality assurance of X-ray-based..., Fontenot [/bib_ref] TG-135 provides specific guidance for QA of robotic radiosurgery systems, [bib_ref] Report No. 135 -Report of AAPM TG 135: quality assurance for robotic..., Dieterich [/bib_ref] and TG-148 provides specific guidance for QA of helical tomotherapy systems. [bib_ref] QA for helical tomotherapy: report of the AAPM Task Group 148, Langen [/bib_ref] \n\n## 5.c.3 | instrumentation for psqa\nThe QMP determines the instrumentation appropriate to the SRS-SBRT technique to be verified. Common instrumentation includes radiochromic film, small-volume ion chamber (for relatively larger treatment fields), diode detector, portal imaging device calibrated for dose response, detector arrays, and, less commonly, polymer gel dosimetry. The institution must provide appropriate instrumentation to conduct PSQA as deemed necessary by the QMP. The clinical service should not be initiated if appropriate instrumentation is not available for the QMP's use.\n\n## 5.d | procedure-specific qa\nProcedure-specific QA addresses issues related to operational tasks, such as checking whether:\n1. The workflows to perform SRS-SBRT as defined in the SOP documents are consistently followed.\n\n## 2.\nStaffing level is appropriate.\n\n## Frequency\nTest Tolerance\n\n## Daily\nLaser localizationonly if using SRS techniques relying on lasers for target localization (e.g., frame-based SRS without X-ray IGRT) Ongoing competency assessment is necessary given the rapid evolution of technology and treatment methods for SRS-SBRT.\nThese activities should be properly documented.\n\n## 5.e | qa program supervision\nThe QA program should be designed by a QMP who has specific training in SRS-SBRT, and should be reviewed by another QMP with SRS-SBRT experience. The daily QA procedure can be performed by a physicist or radiation therapist and be reviewed by the QMP prior to any SRS-SBRT treatment. Other routine QA or patient-specific QA may be performed by an appropriately trained medical physicist, and reviewed and co-signed by the QMP.\n\n## 5.f | qa program review\nWhen the SRS-SBRT program is in its initial phase, the QA program should be reviewed bi-annually as the clinical practice and utilization evolves. The frequency can be reduced to annual reviews once the clinical practice and utilization stabilizes.\n\n## N o t e s\na SRS and SRT using helical tomotherapy were excluded from the scope of this document due to the infrequent use of this technology for SRS and SRT. Exclusion from the scope of this document does not imply any AAPM position regarding the appropriateness of delivering such treatments using helical tomotherapy. b All treatments must occur under supervision of a QMP. In addition, a QMP must provide personal supervision at the first treatment, and as needed for subsequent treatments. The personal supervision should include participation in a time-out checklist, assessment of patient immobilization, assessment of adequate imaging parameters, accuracy of respiratory management (if applicable), consultation on excessive or unusual patient shift requirements during treatment not clearly caused by patient motion on the treatment couch, as well as other patient-or plan-specific needs.\nT A B L E 3 Minimum SBRT relevant equipment QA and tolerances for helical tomotherapy systems.\n\n## Frequency\nTest Tolerance\n[fig] 6: Stereotactic Radiosurgery (SRS)as defined in the American College of Radiology-the American Society for Radiation Oncology (ACR-ASTRO) Practice Parameter for the Performance of Stereotactic Radiosurgery: 3 \"For the purpose of this document, SRS is strictly defined as radiation therapy delivered via stereotactic guidance with approximately 1 mm targeting accuracy to intracranial targets in 1-5 fractions.\" 7.

{"guideline_text": "Paracentesis\n\n# Overview\n\n# Paracentesis\nFor detailed approaching on performing paracentesis watch the video below;\n\n# Overview\nParacentesis is a medical procedure used for a number of reasons:\n- to relieve abdominal pressure from ascites\n- to diagnose spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and other infections (e.g. abdominal TB)\n- to diagnose metastatic cancer\n- to diagnose blood in peritoneal space in trauma\n- to puncture tympanic membrane for eg. to take bacterial swab from middle ear\n\n# Paracentesis for Ascites\nThe procedure is often done in doctors office or an out-patient clinic. In an expert's hands, it is very safe, although there is a very small risk of introducing an infection, causing excessive bleeding or perforating a loop of bowel.\nDuring the procedure, patients are asked to lie down and expose their abdomen. After cleaning the side of abdomen with an antiseptic solution, physicians will numb a small area of skin and then insert a fairly large-bore needle (along with a plastic sheath) 2 to 5 cm to reach the peritoneal (ascitic) fluid. The needle is then removed, leaving the plastic sheath behind to allow drainage of the fluid. The fluid can be drained by gravity or by connection to a vacuum bottle. Up to 10 litres of fluid may be drained during the procedure. If fluid drainage is more than 5 litres, patients may receive intravenous serum albumin (25% albumin, 8g/L) to prevent hypotension (low blood pressure).\nThe procedure generally is not painful; patients require no sedation. As long as they are not very dizzy and maintain their blood pressure after the procedure, they can go home afterwards.\n\n# Ascitic fluid analysis\nThe serum-ascities albumin gradient can help determine the cause of the ascites.\nThe ascitic white blood cell count can help determine if the ascites is infected.\n\n# Contraindications\nMild hematologic abnormalities do not increase the risk of bleeding.

{"guideline_text": "Spinal manipulation\n\n# Definition\nSpinal manipulation is manipulation of synovial joints in the spinal column. The most commonly cited of these are the zygapophysial joints. However, the occipitoatlantal, sacroiliac, costotransverse and costovertebral joints are also synovial joints of the spine that may be manipulated.\n\n# Terminology\nManipulation is known by several other names. Chiropractors refer to manipulation of a spinal joint as an 'adjustment'. Following the labelling system developed by Geoffery Maitland,  manipulation is synonymous with Grade V mobilization. Because of its distinct biomechanics (see section below), the term high velocity low amplitude (HVLA) thrust is often used interchangably with manipulation.\n\n# Biomechanics of spinal manipulation\nSpinal manipulation can be distinguished from from other manual therapy interventions such as  mobilization by its biomechanics, both kinetics and kinematics.\n\n## Kinetics\nUntil recently, force-time histories measured during spinal manipulation were described as consisting of three distinct phases: the preload (or prethrust) phase, the thrust phase, and the resolution phase. Evans and Breen  added a fourth ‘orientation’ phase to describe the period during which the patient is orientated into the appropriate position in preparation for the prethrust phase\n\n## Kinematics\nSection on spine motion segment kinematics only - needs expanding.\nThe kinematics of a complete spinal motion segment, when one of its constituent spinal joints is manipulated, are much more complex than the kinematics that occur during manipulation of an independent peripheral synovial joint.\n\n# Practice of spinal manipulation\nIn the context of healthcare, spinal manipulation is performed by several professional groups. In North America, it is most commonly performed by chiropractors, osteopaths, and physical therapists.\n\n# Mechanisms of action and clinical effects\nThe effects of spinal manipulation have been shown to include:\n- Temporary relief of musculoskeletal pain.\n- Shortened time to recover from acute back pain (RAND).\n- Temporary increase in passive range of motion (ROM).\n- Physiological effects on the central nervous system, probably at the segmental level.\n- No alteration of the position of the sacroiliac joint.\n\n# Effectiveness\nSpinal manipulation may help lumbalgia according to a systematic review of studies\nMore recent trails have conflicting results with one trial showing some benefit and a second trial suggesting a placebo response.\"The results of this study indicate attenuation of pain sensitivity is greater in response to SMT than the expectation of receiving an SMT\". \n\n# Safety issues\nAs with all interventions, there are risks associated with spinal manipulation. Common side effects of spinal manipulation are characterized as mild to moderate and may include: local discomfort, headache, tiredness, or radiating discomfort.  Infrequent, but potentially serious side effects, include: vertebrobasilar accidents (VBA), strokes, spinal disc herniation, vertebral and rib fractures, and cauda equina syndrome.\nIn a 1993 study, J.D. Cassidy, DC, and co-workers concluded that the treatment of lumbar intervertebral disk herniation by side posture manipulation is \"both safe and effective.\"\n\n## Risks of upper cervical manipulation\nThe degree of serious risks associated with manipulation of the cervical spine is uncertain, with widely differing results being published.\nA 1996 Danish chiropractic study confirmed the risk of stroke to be low, and determined that the greatest risk is with manipulation of the first two vertebra of the cervical spine, particularly passive rotation of the neck, known as the \"master cervical\" or \"rotary break.\"\nSerious complications after manipulation of the cervical spine are estimated to be 1 in 4 million manipulations or fewer. A RAND Corporation extensive review estimated \"one in a million.\" Dvorak, in a survey of 203 practitioners of manual medicine in Switzerland, found a rate of one serious complication per 400,000 cervical manipulations, without any reported deaths, among an estimated 1.5 million cervical manipulations. Jaskoviak reported approximately 5 million cervical manipulations from 1965 to 1980 at The National College of Chiropractic Clinic in Chicago, without a single case of vertebral artery stroke or serious injury. Henderson and Cassidy performed a survey at the Canadian Memorial Chiropractic College outpatient clinic where more than a half-million treatments were given over a nine-year period, again without serious incident. Eder offered a report of 168,000 cervical manipulations over a 28 year period, again without a single significant complication. After an extensive literature review performed to formulate practice guidelines, the authors concurred that \"the risk of serious neurological complications (from cervical manipulation) is extremely low, and is approximately one or two per million cervical manipulations.\"\nIn comparison, there is a 3-4% rate of complications for cervical spinal surgery, and 4,000-10,000 deaths per million neck surgeries.\nUnderstandably, vascular accidents are responsible for the major criticism of spinal manipulative therapy. However, it has been pointed out that \"critics of manipulative therapy emphasize the possibility of serious injury, especially at the brain stem, due to arterial trauma after cervical manipulation. It has required only the very rare reporting of these accidents to malign a therapeutic procedure that, in experienced hands, gives beneficial results with few adverse side effects\". In very rare instances, the manipulative adjustment to the cervical spine of a vulnerable patient becomes the final intrusive act which results in a very serious consequence.\nEdzard Ernst has written:\nIn a 2007 followup report in the Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine, Ernst concluded: \"Spinal manipulation, particularly when performed on the upper spine, is frequently associated with mild to moderate adverse effects. It can also result in serious complications such as vertebral artery dissection followed by stroke. Currently, the incidence of such events is not known. In the interest of patient safety we should reconsider our policy towards the routine use of spinal manipulation.\"\n\n## Potential for incident underreporting\nStatistics on the reliability of incident reporting for injuries related to manipulation of the cervical spine vary. The RAND study assumed that only 1 in 10 cases would have been reported. However, Prof Ernst surveyed neurologists in Britain for cases of serious neurological complications occurring within 24 hours of cervical spinal manipulation by various types of practitioners; 35 cases had been seen by the 24 neurologists who responded, but none of the cases had been reported. He concluded that underreporting was close to 100%, rendering estimates \"nonsensical.\" He therefore suggested that \"clinicians might tell their patients to adopt a cautious approach and avoid the type of spinal manipulation for which the risk seems greatest: forceful manipulation of the upper spine with a rotational element.\"  The NHS Centre for Reviews and Dissemination stated that the survey had methodological problems with data collection.  Both NHS and Ernst noted that bias is a problem with the survey method of data collection.\nA 2001 study in the journal Stroke found that vertebrobasilar accidents (VBAs) were five times more likely in those aged less than 45 years who had visited a chiropractor in the preceding week, compared to controls who had not visited a chiropractor. No significant associations were found for those over 45 years. The authors concluded: \"While our analysis is consistent with a positive association in young adults... The rarity of VBAs makes this association difficult to study despite high volumes of chiropractic treatment.\" The NHS notes that this study collected data objectively by using administrative data, involving less recall bias than survey studies, but the data were collected retrospectively and probably contained inaccuracies.\nIn 1996, Coulter et al. had a multidisciplinary group of 4 MDs, 4 DCs and 1 MD/DC look at 736 conditions where it was used. Their job was to evaluate the appropriateness of manipulation or mobilization of the cervical spine in those cases (including a few cases not performed by chiropractors).\n\"According to the report ... 57.6% of reported indications for cervical manipulation was considered inappropriate, with 31.3% uncertain. Only 11.1% could be labeled appropriate. A panel of chiropractors and medical practitioners concluded that '. . . much additional scientific data about the efficacy of cervical spine manipulation are needed.'\"\n\n## Misattribution problems\nStudies of stroke and manipulation do not always clearly identify what professional has performed the manipulation. In some cases this has led to confusion and improper placement of blame. In a 1995 study, chiropractic researcher Allan Terrett, DC, pointed to this problem:\nThis error was taken into account in a 1999 review of the scientific literature on the risks and benefits of manipulation of the cervical spine (MCS). Special care was taken, whenever possible, to correctly identify all the professions involved, as well as the type of manipulation responsible for any injuries and/or deaths. It analyzed 177 cases that were reported in 116 articles published between 1925 and 1997, and summarized:\nIn Figure 1 in the review, the types of injuries attributed to manipulation of the cervical spine are shown, and Figure 2 shows the type of practitioner involved in the resulting injury.  For the purpose of comparison, the type of practitioner was adjusted according to the findings by Terrett. \nThe review concluded:\n\n# Emergency medicine\nIn emergency medicine joint manipulation can also refer to the process of bringing fragments of fractured bone or dislocated joints into normal anatomical alignment (otherwise known as 'reducing' the fracture or dislocation). These procedures have no relation to the HVLA thrust procedure.", "source": "wikidoc", "question": "According to authoritative guidelines, discuss the clinical indications, demonstrated effectiveness, proposed mechanisms of action, and the key safety considerations (including population risks, upper‑cervical specific hazards, estimates of complication rates and issues of underreporting), that should guide a clinician’s decision to offer or avoid spinal manipulation and inform patient consent."}
{"guideline_text": "Sandbox: TMNG\n\n# Pathophysiology\n- Toxic Multinodular Goiter (TMNG) is the result of hyperfunctioning thyroid follicles that are producing excess of thyroid hormones.\n- TMNG develops on top of hypertrophied thyroid from prolonged (due to iodine deficiency or any cause of primary hypothyroidism). Low T3 and T4 levels cause prolonged TSH stimulation which causes hypertrophy of the thyroid gland and the development of focal or diffuse hyperplasia.\n- Some of the nodules might develop hyperplasia and autonomous activity while others might degenerate, bleed and calcify.\n- After the gland has undergone global activation and hyperplasia. Thyrotoxicity develops due to focal epithelial cell proliferation and thyroxine secretion.\n- Hyperplastic gland is more likely to develop toxic goiter due to the following factors:\n- With high proliferation rate in the hyperplastic gland, there might be transcription errors that go unchecked. This gives rise to a variety of mutations including mutations leading to activation of cAMP such as TSH-R and Gsα mutations.\n- The process of synthesis of  thyroxines involves the production of H2O2  and other free radicals, increasing the chance of developing mutations.\n- A thyroid gland under the stress of over proliferation (in response to a state of hypothyroidism and excessive TSH stimulation) has increased growth factor expression. After resolution of the stimulus, the proliferating follicles continue to produce thyroxines even after the TSH stimulus ceases. Moreover, cells having the mutations will continue to produce cells having the same mutations.\n\n# Historical perspective\n- Goiter was first seen in the inhabitants of Alps.

Pioneer surgeons, such as John Kirklin, Francis Fontan, Euryclides Zerbini, Adib Jatene, and Denton Cooley were part of our lives and we were able to study their papers, witness their presentations and participate in professional discussions. They are passing away one after another but their work, techniques, experience and wisdom stays with us as their legacy. The impact of their methods profoundly changed the lives of our DOI: 10.21470/1678-9741-2018-0347 are in discussion with the Federal Councils regarding ways for this activity to be uniformly recognized by the Professions and subsequently legalized with a federal law regulating perfusion activities. Brazilian perfusionists must have the education, tools and authority to perform their job and to become active and respected members of the multidisciplinary cardiac surgery team. Several limitations currently exist which impair the advancement of perfusion practice, including educational gaps, a lack of case ownership, and a lack of tools to assess the adequacy of perfusion in real time during surgery. This is a vicious cycle which impacts outcomes and patient safety.\nOn a positive note, it is important to highlight the progress made by the Brazilian Society of Extracorporeal Circulation. Supported and stimulated by their society, a significant number of Brazilian perfusionists have had the opportunity to attend symposium-based perfusion related courses, exchange experiences with more advanced international programs and to discuss current techniques of extracorporeal circulation with local perfusionists and those from abroad.\nIn more developed countries, perfusionists have the freedom to choose perfusion products according their performance, their patient population's needs, and the information available in the literature. Each component is selected via an independent decision with the ideal components used to build the circuit. Alternatively, in Brazilian perfusion practice, it is difficult to be objective since product decisions are almost exclusively based on price and subjective preferences due to the lack of scientific publications comparing Brazilian perfusion products with those available in other markets. In our country, oxygenator manufacturers typically provide complimentary HLMs with an agreement that their oxygenator can only be guaranteed on their HLM. There is an obvious conflict of interest with such an agreement. This implied agreement has no scientific basis and, to our knowledge, is not practiced elsewhere which speaks to the need for change in Brazilian cardiac surgery. Again, our culture needs to adapt to end such practices for the benefit of our patients. This is even more of a concern when one notes that the majority of HLMs made and used in Brazil do not have servoregulating safety devices incorporated for arterial flow, cardioplegia delivery, level sensing, and bubble detectors. Servoregulation for HLM functions is not enough. Perfusionists must also be trained to operate the devices. Standards for perfusion practice, including the use of safety devices, must be established and adhered to.\n\n## Why are clinical perfusion standards so important?\nThe Gritten Report published by the University Hospitals of Bristol National Health Service (NHS) Foundation Trust of Great Britain described the death of a five-month-old infant undergoing complex cardiac surgery and was released May 25, 2005. The Root Cause Analysis (RCA) report was led by Mark Gritten, an independent and nationally known NHS senior professional. A police investigation and coroner's inquest labeled the case 'unlawful killing' . In English law, unlawful killing means that the killing was made without lawful excuse and in violation of criminal law including murder, manslaughter, and infanticide. The finding of unlawful killing must be beyond reasonable doubt; that is, the evidence must be overwhelmingly patients with congenital heart defects, giving them the chance of enjoying a better quality of life. Now, the pioneering era of cardiac surgery has essentially ended in Brazil.\nCongenital cardiac surgery is markedly changing and surgeon-centered outcomes are being replaced by teambased efforts with new paradigms requiring an adaptive work environment in institutions where cardiac surgery is performed.\nAs William Norwood aptly put in his paper, Our Roots, Our Future , \"Institutions are not what they are by historical prerogative: the people walking the halls are responsible for maintaining the legacy and creating new vistas. \" That being said, we need to continue the initial work of our pioneers and press on upgrading their achievements to ever higher standards. The era we have now entered is no longer about quantity, it is about achieving excellent whole-patient quality outcomes including optimized neurologic outcomes. We must dig deep into issues that impact the quality of outcomes, teamwork and overall transparency in our respective professions.\n\n## Reviewing perfusion practice: time to stop living in the past\nBrazil has a strong history of innovation that extends back to the earliest days of cardiac surgery when our centers pioneered advances in heart-lung machines (HLMs), cardiac valves, conduit implants, and surgical techniques. Brazil started to produce their own HLMs in 1959 and indeed used one of them to perform the first heart transplantation in South America. These innovations highlighted the teamwork primarily of surgeons and biomedical engineers. This was natural since surgeons and other physicians were the first 'perfusionists' . Additionally, perfusion products, including a series of oxygenators, were developed and manufactured domestically. While we fondly remember these great achievements, we also need to focus on the future. Unfortunately, there are still people living in the past and not adapting to evolving cardiac surgery and perfusion practices. We continue to blame our economic burden for the stagnation of our practice while paying little to no attention to the need for cultural change in the operating room.\nFurthermore, clinical perfusion has not been recognized by the government as a distinctive profession until quite recently. Currently, only five professional councils recognize Perfusion as a specialty for their undergraduates: Biology, Biomedicine, Nursing, Pharmacy, and Physiotherapy. These professions do not have a standardized perfusion-specific curriculum. Consequently, perfusionist education and training is heterogenous. Furthermore, it is still the case in Brazil that perfusionists must follow the instructions of surgeons and anesthesiologists. In fact, the conduct of perfusion is only considered a medical act once the perfusion record is signed by the surgeon. This practice risks perfusionists not taking full ownership for the conduct of CPB and that raises serious safety concerns since the surgeon and anesthesiologist have much to attend to during cardiac surgery and the perfusionist is the individual who can best manage extracorporeal support with all of its nuances. These facts support the outdated paradigm whereby perfusionists are essentially asked to follow the instructions of surgeons and anesthesiologists during CPB instead of working collaboratively within a famework of well-developed perfusion practice guidelines. Currently, the SBCEC and the SBCCV Considering our context, the effort of publishing this document by the societies SBCCV and SBCEC should be considered as one of most important steps for the future of cardiopulmonary bypass practice in Brazil.\nThe \"holy trinity\" for the cardiac surgey patient-perfusionist, surgeon and anesthesist-is a critical issue for optimal outcomes in cardiac surgery. Therefore, publication in Brazil of the Standards and Guidelines for Perfusion Practice aims not only to improve CPB but also to improve overall surgical outcomes as an important quality improvment initiative.\n\n## Perfusion and the pediatric cardiac surgery:\nIn the early 1950s, the pioneers of congenital cardiac surgery, among them-Bigelow, Lewis, Kirklin, Gibbon and others-realized that the time available with hypothermia and inflow occlusion would not be sufficient to safely perform lenghty intracardiac operations and that an extracorporeal support system would be needed. In 1954, Lillehei introduced the technique of controlled cross-circulation, in which a patient's parent functioned as the extracorporeal pump and oxygenator-a system that put both the parent and the child at risk. Therefore, the development of mechanical cardiopulmonary bypass circuits in the late 1950s was an important step for the progress of congenital cardiac surgery. Since then, extracorporeal perfusion circuits have come a long way to the current low prime membrane oxygenators, the use of centrifugal pumps, vacuumassisted venous drainage, electronic gas blenders, in-line oxygen analyzers and other important devices.\nThe array and complexity of the equipment, the perfusion techniques to manage a wide variety of patient's age and size along with the broad spectrum of surgical procedures are real challenges that require properly trained and knowledgeable perfusionists.\nBecause one size does not fit all, the need for a standalone Standards and Guidelines document to perform perfusion for congenital heart surgery is unquestionable and it will in many ways be unique as compared to the one used for the correction of acquired heart disease in adults.\nProviding cardiopulmonary support for repair of congenital heart lesions has become a specialty standing on its own. This context should determine the strategies and processes to address these issues; the professionals, administrators, and professional societies should be engaged in planning, setting and articulating the goals of robust pediatric perfusion standards and guidelines to improve the outcomes in pediatric cardiac surgery.\nThe Brazilian Society for Cardiovascular Surgery (SBCCV) and the Brazilian Society for Extracorporeal Circulation (SBCEC) Standards and Guidelines for Perfusion Practice address perfusion in general. We believe that developing a specific Brazilian Pediatric Perfusion Standards and Guidelines document is essential and that it should be published in the near future to complement this document.\n\n## Development of this document\nThe Standards and Guidelines for Perfusion Practice will serve as a useful guide for Brazilian cardiac surgical teams to develop obvious that death would result from the act when all factors are taken into account. Otherwise, a verdict of accidental death or death by misadventure would apply. The death was the result of a calcium overdose by a perfusionist that caused irreversible brain damage and subsequent death the day after surgery. The hospital put safeguards into place immediately to minimize any similar incidents happening again. Also, the National Society of Perfusionists perhaps carried some responsibility for this incident because it does not appear to have disseminated other perfusion incidents between its members.\nThe report concluded that this was a unique but avoidable incident that resulted in an indictment not just to the perfusionist involved in the accident, but to all perfusionists and the perfusion profession as a whole in Great Britain. Had a similar incident happened in São Paulo or Rio or elsewhere in Brazil, would the SBCEC or SBCCV also be held responsible?\nPerfusion practice during cardiovascular surgery is recognized in the international literature as a critical component to successful patient outcomes. Therefore, as medical societies, we have the responsibility to change our culture, our commercial practices, legislation, regulations and whatever else which involves our specialty which can improve patient outcomes . The intent of our proposed standards and guidelines document is to provide a modern framework for the practice of cardiopulmonary bypass in Brazil that can maximize patient safety and outcomes.\nThe standards and guidelines document we developed for perfusion practice in Brazil is based on publications from AmSECT . It focuses on the role of written institutional protocols to dictate clinical practice. We worked on four main subjects:\na. empowerment of perfusion as profession with a focus on professional qualification and education standards b. standardization of perfusion practices c. mandatory safety devices d. importance of non-technical skills and patient centered team work\n\n## Professional constraints:\nAlthough perfusion is considered a medical act, Perfusion as a profession is still not fully regulated in Brazil. Consequently, the legal responsibility for what happens at the pump is unclear. The surgeon's knowledge of what is actually happening on the pump at all times during an operation depends upon their communications with the perfusionist. The surgeon's signature on the perfusion record is a formality which does not ensure proper care during CPB. This practice jeopardizes the development of a new generation of perfusionists who should be taking ownership for their individual perfusion cases and, of course, introducing the necessary changes to modernize existing clinical practices. The Perfusionist must be responsible for the whole procedure of extracorporeal circulation and be an active member of the cardiac surgery team, as is the case with most enters abroad.\nAccording to the SBCEC, perfusionists are expected to have: a. Dedication to the patient b. Full integration with the team in which they work c. Professional competence d. Personal ethical and professional conduct, as well as being zealous, affable, aware and observant.\naccept this document as an official position for the Standards and Guidelines for Perfusion Practice in Brazil. Both documents are included in this manuscript. The SBCCV and SBCEC endorse this comprehensive report and strongly recommend implementation.\n\n## Minimum standards for perfusion practice in brazil:\nSeven standards were identified as the minimum recomendation for perfusion practice. The SBCCV and SBCEC considers these seven standards as mandatory for all cardiac surgical centers (Appendix 1).\n\n## Sbccv/sbcec comprehensive standards and guidelines for perfusion practice in brazil:\nThe Perfusion Standards listed in Appendix 2 have been modified and adapted to the Brazilian regulatoy agencies' policies and recommendations, by taking The American Society of ExtraCorporeal Technology (AmSECT) Standards and Guidelines as a model and translated to Portuguese. The final document consists of 15 areas of practice including 50 Standards and 38 Guidelines (Appendix 1) with the first standard focusing on the development of institutional protocols to support their implementation and use. Each institution must commit to working towards implementing all standards for patients undergoing cardiovascular surgery.\n\n## Terminology\nThe SBCCV and SBCEC would like to point out that cardiac surgery clinicians must understand the terminology used in this report. The meanings of these words, as described in the AmSECT publications, are listed below in order to facilitate understanding and adoption of the Standards and Guidelines :\nStandards: practices, technology, and/or conduct of care that institutions shall meet to fulfill the minimum requirements for cardiopulmonary bypass Guidelines: recommendation that should be considered and may assist in the development and implementation of protocols Protocols: an institution-specific written document, derived from professional standards and guidelines, which contains decision and treatment algorithms\nIn this document, the word shall is used to indicate a mandatory requirement In this document, the word should is used to indicate a recommendation In this document, the term surgical care team is used to indicate the components of the system: surgeon, anesthesiologist, perfusionist, nurse, and technicians\n\n# Conclusion\nThe SBCCV and SBCEC both recognize the vital need for cultural and clinical changes in the application of cardiopulmonary bypass in Brazil. Cardiac surgery centers must adopt the Minimum institution-specific protocols aimed at improving the reliability, safety, and effectiveness of cardiopulmonary bypass. We are aware that the development of a Standards and Guidelines for Perfusion document alone will not change patient care or outcomes. Safe, reliable, and effective care will be best served through the implementation of institutional protocols based on these standards. SBCCV/SBCEC's Standards and Guidelines for Perfusion Practice reflect the changing landscape for perfusion leading to the safe and optimal provision of cardiopulmonary bypass for our patients as well as a working team-based environment that is supportive of these policies.\nWe preferred to name this document \"Standards and Guidelines for Perfusion Practice\" because this terminology is contemporary and coincides with the language used by other professional medical societies, including AmSECT .\nThe SBCCV/SBCEC Standards and Guidelines for Perfusion Practice: 2018 is primarily based on a previous document developed by AmSECT, through its Perfusion Quality Committee. Initially, AmSECT developed a draft standard for perfusion entitled the \"Essentials for Perfusion Practice, Clinical Function: Conduct of Extracorporeal Circulation, \" which was originally endorsed by the membership in 1993 , and then reviewed and revised on a number of occasions . In 2011, the AmSECT Board of Directors (BOD) asked the International Consortium for Evidence-Based Perfusion (ICEBP) subcommittee to review and update the \"Essentials and Guidelines\" document. The ICEBP conducted a careful review and critique of the document as well as its relevance and purpose, given the focus on patient safety and surgical outcomes. This initiative resulted in a revised joint document entitled, the Report from AmSECT's, International Consortium for Evidence-Based Perfusion American Society of ExtraCorporeal Technology Standards and Guidelines for Perfusion Practice: 2013 . It was developed as an outgrowth of marrying evidence-based practices from the literature with an understanding of the context in which care is currently provided. Quite notably at the same time, the Minimum Standards for Perfusion Practice in Brazil document was developed as an outgrowth of ongoing collaboration with the International Quality Improvement Collaborative for Congenital Heart Surgery (IQIC) which is managed from Boston Children's Hospital and overseen by an international steering committee. Adoption of the Minimum Standards for Perfusion Practice in Brazil document will empower perfusionists to effect change at their institution by working towards practice standards endorsed by their national organizations including minimum safety devices for all cardiopulmonary bypass cases, monitoring devices to help assess the adequacy of perfusion, and promotion of a teambased appoach for the care of cardiac surgical patients. Our vision to improve perfusion practice, and thus patient outcomes, is for the minimum standards to be adopted as soon as possible by Brazilian cardiac surgery teams with the comprehensive list of AmSECT standards phased in as soon as practial given the constraints discussed previously.\nFollowing translation to Portuguese and critical review by colleagues, this final document was presented to the SBCCV and SBCEC for their steering commitiee aproval. A majority of the members of the steering commities of both societies voted to Standards For Perfusion Practice in Brazil as soon as possible and work towards adopting the Comprehensive Standards and Guidelines for Perfusion Practice in Brazil moving forward. Ultimately, a team-based approach utilizing nationally endorsed standards will help ensure safe and optimal cardiopulmonary bypass for all our patients and improve outcomes for the complex population we serve.\n\n## Acknowlegdements\nThe DECAM/SBCCV and SBCEC would like to thank AmSECT for graciously allowing us to use their pioneering efforts as we work to improve perfusion practice in Brazil.

{"guideline_text": "Tonic-clonic seizure\n\n# Overview\nTonic-clonic seizures (also known as Grand Mal Seizures, though this term is now discouraged and rarely used in a clinical setting) are a type of generalised seizure affecting the whole brain. Tonic-clonic seizures are the seizure type most commonly associated with epilepsy and seizures in general, though it is a misconception that they are the only type. (See seizure types)\nTonic-clonic seizures are induced deliberately in Electroconvulsive therapy.\n\n# Pathophysiology\nThe vast majority of generalised seizures are idiopathic.  However, some generalised seizures start as a smaller seizure such as a simple partial seizure or a complex partial seizure and then spread to both hemispheres of the brain. This is called a secondary generalisation.  In the case of idiopathic epilepsy, it is not certain what is the cause of the seizures. However, it is believed that factors could include chemical and neurotransmitter imbalances, and a genetically determined seizure threshold, which have both been implicated. The seizure threshold can be altered by fatigue, malnutrition, lack of sleep or rest, hypertension, stress, diabetes, the presence of neon or laser flashes or lights, rapid motion or flight,\nblood sugar imbalances, anxiety and other factors. \nIn the case of symptomatic epilepsy, it is often determined by MRI or other neuroimaging techniques that there is some degree of damage to a large number of neurons. The lesions (scar tissue) caused by the loss of these neurons can result in groups of neurons episodically firing abnormally, creating a seizure.\n\n# Phases\nThe seizures are divided into two phases, the tonic phase and the clonic phase, hence the name of the seizure, though a tonic-clonic seizure will often be preceded by an aura.\n- In the aura, the person may feel a sense of strong deja vu, lightheadedness and/or dizziness, unusual (and possibly inappropriate) emotions, altered vision and hearing (which may or may not include hallucinations), and sometimes other symptoms. This is actually a simple partial seizure. Sometimes, the person will lose complete awareness and start making odd or pointless movements (such as picking at clothes) towards the end of the aura, at which point the seizure has progressed to become a complex partial seizure. The aura stage is due to the fact that tonic-clonic seizures often start in an isolated area of the brain, and gradually progress to the whole brain, at which point it becomes a tonic-clonic seizure. An aura may last as little as a few seconds up to several minutes, depending on the person, and some people with epilepsy do not experience auras at all. It should also be noted that in many individuals, not all auras result in a tonic-clonic seizure.\n- In the tonic phase, the person will fall unconscious, and the person's muscles will suddenly tense up, often causing the extremities to either be pulled towards the body or rigidly pushed away from it, which will cause the person to fall to the ground if they are standing. The tonic phase is usually the shortest part of the seizure, usually lasting only a few seconds. The person may also express vocalisations sounding like a loud moan during the tonic stage, though this is not always the case.\n- In the clonic phase, the person's muscles will start to contract and relax rapidly, causing convulsions. These may range from exaggerated twitches of the arms and legs to violent shaking or vibrating of the stiffened extremities. The person may roll and stretch as the seizure spreads. The eyes typically roll back, the tongue is often bitten, and incontinence is seen in some cases.  Post-ictal sleep invariably follows a tonic-clonic seizure.  Confusion and amnesia upon awakening is usually experienced.\n\n# First aid\nMany people who experience tonic-clonic seizures will be aware of an oncoming seizure for up to several minutes before the full seizure begins. This is called an aura and is typically a simple partial seizure or a complex partial seizure which has spread to the whole brain. However, many people who have epilepsy do not experience auras. If a person reports they believe they are about to have a seizure, their safety should be ensured. This can be done by laying them into the recovery position, and removing any objects which may pose a danger to the person during the seizure. If the person does not experience an aura, and goes directly into a seizure, they should be gently eased to the ground if possible.\nOnce the convulsions have begun, the seizure must simply run its course. No attempt to restrain the person should be made because this risks injury to either party, instead it should be ensured that they do not injure themselves by placing something soft under their head, and ensuring their limbs and body don't bump into walls or other objects. If the person vomits, the person's head should be placed to the side to allow the vomit to run out of the mouth without blocking the airway. Nothing should ever be placed into the person's mouth, as this can cause the person to bite their tongue or choke, (or injure the one placing the object into their mouth). Despite popular belief, it is not possible for someone having a seizure to swallow their tongue. The frenulum of the tongue prevents this.\nOnce the seizure ends, the person will stop convulsing, the limbs will go limp, and the person will be completely unconscious for a while. Once they start to come to, they will usually be tired, disoriented, and unaware they have had a seizure. A person having a seizure should never be left unattended until they are fully recovered.\nIf the person is known to have epilepsy, it is not usually necessary to call an ambulance. However, if the person is not known to have epilepsy, the seizure lasts four to five minutes or longer, the person has a second seizure before regaining consciousness, or the person injures themselves or stops breathing (apnea) during or after the seizure, medical attention is needed.", "source": "wikidoc", "question": "According to authoritative guidelines on tonic‑clonic seizures, discuss your immediate first‑aid management for an adult who is having a tonic‑clonic seizure—covering what to do if an aura is reported, what to do once convulsions begin (including airway and safety measures), what actions must be avoided and why, and the specific criteria that should prompt emergent medical attention."}
{"guideline_text": "Infusion set\nAn infusion set is used with an insulin pump as part of intensive insulin therapy.  The purpose of an infusion set is to deliver insulin under the skin.  It is a complete tubing system to connect an insulin pump to the pump user:  it includes a subcutaneous cannula, adhesive mount, quick-disconnect, and a pump cartridge connector.\n\n# Using an infusion set\nFirstly, the user must attach a reservoir of insulin to the set and connect it to the pump. The set is then \"primed\" - the pump pushes insulin quickly through the tubing and the cannula to ensure no air is in the system before insertion. Note that it is vital that the infusion set is not inserted into the skin when the set is being primed (as this could result in the accidental delivery of a large dose of insulin). The user then peels off the paper protecting the adhesive pad and carefully inserts the needle beneath the skin.\nThe cannula is usually made of flexible plastic, which allows it to move without causing discomfort to the patient.  The needle is pushed into the layer of fat below the skin, taking the plastic cannula with it. The needle is then removed, leaving the cannula in place. Insertion should be done in a fairly swift movement to avoid the cannula \"bunching up\" around the needle. The needle is then removed, leaving the cannula below the skin.\nA few pump users prefer an infusion set with a steel needle instead of a cannula.  The cannula surrounds a steel needle similar to that found on a hypodermic syringe.\n\n## Insertion devices\nSome pump users prefer to use an insertion device to insert their sets, rather than pushing the needle in by hand. These are spring-loaded and are designed to push the needle into the skin quickly and (usually) painlessly. The user simply loads the primed set into the insertion device, peels off the paper protecting the adhesive pad, places the device against the skin and presses a button. This may be an advantage for those with needle phobia.\n\n## Sites for infusion sets\nMany pump users site their infusion sets on the abdomen, in a roughly semicircular area around and below the navel. Other sites include the upper leg, upper buttocks, hips, upper arms and lower back. Insulin absorption may vary from site to site, so it is important that patients are advised of the most effective sites to use by their diabetes adviser.\n\n## Rotation of sites\nThe infusion set must be replaced regularly, usually every 2-3 days. Insulin absorption becomes less effective the longer the set is left in place, leading to poorer control of blood glucose. For this reason, the site of the infusion set is moved when the set is changed.  Often a number of favorite sites for the infusion set are used on a rotation basis.\n\n## Disconnecting the set\nThe set can be disconnected from the pump and tubing with a quick-release that leaves the cannula and adhesive pad in place.  This is convenient when swimming or showering (since most pumps are not fully waterproof), or when engaging in any activity when it is not desirable to be attached to the pump.\n\n# Types of infusion set\nThere are several types, styles, and sizes of infusion sets available to allow an insulin pump user a choice to customize what works best for them. These vary in cannula length, cannula entry angle and in the length of tube connecting the cannula to the pump. For instance, an individual with little body fat may choose to use a set with a short cannula that enters the skin at a shallow angle, whereas an individual with more body fat may find that a longer cannula entering at right angles to the skin works best. Most infusion sets have a standard Luer Lock connector so that they will mate to most insulin pumps.  However, this is not always the case:  some pump manufactures use a proprietary connector, and so their customers must buy only their infusion sets.\n\n# For additional information\nFor help choosing an appropriate infusion set, pump users may contact their certified diabetes educator or one of the following support groups for insulin pumpers:\nFor more information, see the manufacturers websites:\n:30/article/DCM_general_article_295.htm\nVarious infusion sets at a glance:\nChose the right infusion set for you:", "source": "wikidoc", "question": "According to authoritative guidelines, discuss how you would counsel an adult insulin pump user on choosing and using an infusion set—covering selection of cannula type and length, priming and safe insertion (including use of insertion devices), preferred sites and rotation strategy, recommended replacement interval, procedures for temporary disconnection, and the rationale behind each recommendation to optimize insulin absorption and minimize complications."}
{"guideline_text": "Kallmann syndrome\n\n# Overview\nKallmann syndrome is an example of hypogonadism (decreased functioning of the sex hormone-producing glands) caused by a deficiency of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), which is created by the hypothalamus. Kallmann syndrome is also known as hypothalamic hypogonadism, familial hypogonadism with anosmia, or hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, reflecting its disease mechanism.\nKallmann syndrome is a form of secondary hypogonadism reflecting the fact the primary cause of the defect in sex hormone production lies within the pituitary and hypothalamus rather than a physical defect of the testes or ovaries themselves.\nKallmann syndrome was described in 1944 by Franz Josef Kallmann, a German-American geneticist. However, others - such as the Spanish doctor Aureliano Maestre de San Juan - had noticed a correlation between anosmia and hypogonadism in 1856.\nThe most well known person who has Kallmann syndrome in modern times is the jazz vocalist Jimmy Scott. In 2004, Canadian writer Brian Brett published a memoir, Uproar's Your Only Music, about growing up with Kallmann syndrome.\n\n# Epidemiology\nKallmann syndrome occurs at a rate of 1 in 10,000 male births and 1 in 50,000 female births. It may be inherited as an X-linked condition, an autosomal dominant condition or as an autosomal recessive condition. Statistics are sparse, but it seems that autosomal dominant is the most common form of heredity.\nOne recent paper  quoted an incidence in males of 0.025%, or 1 in 4,000, with the female incidence being 3 to 5 times less.\nEven though mutations in the KAL-1 gene on the X chromosome can cause Kallmann syndrome, only 11-14% of patients with Kallmann syndrome have detectable KAL-1 mutations.\nAutosomal dominant mutations have been described with the FGFR-1 (8p12) gene, sometimes referred to as the KAL-2 gene.  This is thought to cause about 10% of cases.\nAutosomal recessive mutations of the GnRH receptor gene (4q13.2) have also been reported. This defect appears to produce a wider spectrum of physical symptoms than with the other gene defects, and the defect lies in the ability of the pituitary gland to recognise GnRH, rather than the ability of the hypothalamus to produce GnRH. It is debatable as to whether this is in fact Kallmann syndrome since the GnRH receptor development is not related to anosmia.\nThere may also be no obvious family history of inheritance (sporadic cases). However, it is possible for Kallmann syndrome genes to be passed on to children of a sporadic case.\n\n# Pathophysiology\nUnder normal conditions, GnRH travels from the hypothalamus to the pituitary gland via the hypophyseal portal system, where it triggers production and release of gonadotropins (LH and FSH) from the gonadotropes.  When GnRH is low, the pituitary does not create the normal amount of gonadotropins. The gonadotropins normally increase the production of gonadal steroids, so when they are low, these steroids will be low as well.\nIn Kallmann syndrome, the GnRH neurons do not migrate properly from the olfactory placode to the hypothalamus during development.  The olfactory bulbs also fail to form or have hypoplasia, leading to anosmia or hyposmia.\nKallmann syndrome can be inherited as an X-linked recessive trait, in which case there is a defect in the KAL1 gene, which maps to chromosome Xp22.3. KAL encodes a neural cell adhesion molecule, anosmin-1. Anosmin-1 is normally expressed in the brain, facial mesenchyme, mesonephros and metanephros. It is required to promote migration of GnRH neurons into the hypothalamus. It also allows migration of olfactory neurons from the olfactory bulbs to the hypothalamus.\nAn autosomal dominant gene on chromosome 8 {8p12} (KAL-2 or FGFR-1 (fibroblast growth factor receptor 1)) is thought to cause about 10% of cases. There is some recent evidence to suggest a degree of linkage between the KAL-1 and FGFR-1 genes.\nAn additional autosomal cause of Kallmann syndrome has been reported by a mutations in the prokineticin receptor-2 gene (PROKR2)(KAL-3) at position 20p13 and its ligand prokineticin 2 (PROK2)(KAL-4) at position 3p21.1. It was noted that mutations in these genes brought about various degrees of olfactory and reproductive dysfunction, but not the other symptoms seen in KAL-1 and KAL-2 forms of Kallmann Syndrome. The authors of the paper suggested that up to 30% of all Kallmann Syndrome cases can be linked to known genetic mutations.\n\n# Features\nKallmann syndrome is characterized by:\n- Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (a lack of the pituitary hormones LH and FSH)\n- Congenital (present from birth) anosmia (complete inability to smell) or hyposmia (decreased ability to smell)\nIt can occasionally be associated with optic problems, such as colour blindness or optic atrophy, nerve deafness, cleft palate, cryptorchidism, renal agenesis, and mirror movement disorder. However, it is not clear at this time how or if these other problems have the same cause as the hypogonadism and anosmia. These problems are more often present in those without Kallmann syndrome.\nMales present with delayed puberty and may have micropenis (although congenital micropenis is not present in the majority of male KS cases).\nFemales present with delayed puberty (i.e. primary amenorrhea) and lack of secondary sex characteristics, such as breast development.\n\n# Diagnosis\nThe diagnosis is often one of exclusion found during the workup of delayed puberty. The presence of anosmia together with micropenis in boys should suggest Kallmann syndrome (although micropenis alone may have other causes).\n\n# Treatment\nTreatment is directed at restoring the deficient hormones -- known as hormone replacement therapy (HRT). Males are administered human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) or testosterone. Females are treated with oestrogen and progestins.\nTo induce fertility in males or females, GnRH (aka LHRH) is administered by an infusion pump, or hCG/hMG/FSH/LH combinations are administered through regular injections. Fertility is only maintained whilst actually being treated with these hormones.  Once fertility treatment stops it is necessary to revert to the normal HRT of testosterone for men and oestrogen + progestins for women.\nThe main health risk, for both men and women, of untreated Kallmann Syndrome is osteoporosis. Therefore, regular bone density scans (every 2 years or so) are advisable, even if being treated with HRT. Additional medication specifically for osteoporosis is necessary in some cases.\n\n# Differential Diagnosis\nKallmann's Syndrome should be differentiated from other causes of gonadotropin (FSH/LH) deficiency. The following table outlines the major differentials:", "source": "wikidoc", "question": "According to authoritative guidelines, outline a structured approach to the adolescent male who presents with delayed puberty and anosmia suspicious for Kallmann syndrome, including the key diagnostic steps and differential considerations, the initial and long‑term hormone replacement and fertility‑induction treatment options, relevant genetic counselling points, and recommended monitoring to reduce long‑term risks such as osteoporosis."}
{"guideline_text": "Carbon disulfide\nCarbon disulfide is a colorless, volatile liquid with the formula CS2. The compound is used frequently as a building block in organic chemistry as well as an industrial and chemical non-polar solvent.  It has an \"ether-like\" odor, but commercial samples are typically contaminated with foul-smelling impurities.\n\n# Occurrence and manufacture\nSmall amounts of carbon disulfide are released by volcanic eruptions and marshes.  CS2 once was manufactured by combining carbon (or coke) and sulfur at high temperatures.  A lower temperature reaction, requiring only 600 °C utilizes natural gas as the carbon source in the presence of silica gel or alumina catalysts:\nThe reaction is analogous to the combustion of methane.  Although it is isoelectronic to carbon dioxide, CS2 is highly flammable:\n\n# Reactions\nCompared to CO2, CS2 is more reactive toward nucleophiles and more easily reduced. These differences in reactivity can be attributed to the weaker π donor-ability of the sulfido centers, which renders the carbon more electrophilic.  It is widely used in the synthesis of organosulfur compounds such as Metham sodium, a soil fumigant.\n\n## Addition of nucleophiles\nNucleophiles such as amines afford dithiocarbamates:\nXanthates form similarly from alkoxides:\nThis reaction is the basis of the manufacture of regenerated cellulose, the main ingredient of viscose, rayon and cellophane.  Both xanthates and the related thioxanthates (derived from treatment of CS2 with sodium thiolates) are used as flotation agents in mineral processing.\nSodium sulfide affords trithiocarbonate:\n\n## Reduction\nSodium reduces CS2 to give the heterocycle \"dmit2-\":\nDirect electrochemical reduction affords the tetrathiooxalate anion:\n\n## Chlorination\nChlorination of CS2 is the principal route to carbon tetrachloride:\nThis conversion proceeds via the intermediacy of thiophosgene, CSCl2.\n\n## Coordination chemistry\nCS2 is a ligand for many metal complexes, forming pi complexes.  One example is CpCo(η2-CS2)(PMe3).\n\n# Commercial Availability\nCS2, being highly flammable and having one of the lowest autoignition temperatures, cannot be transported easily using commercial means. Worldwide exports of this chemical are negligible.\n\n## Pressurized Liquid Nitrogen Based Sample\nJohnson Matthey's sister company Alfa Aesar was the first company to introduce carbon disulfide in the form of pressurized bottle containing a solution of pressurized nitrogen, coupling agent, stablizer, and carbon disulfide, with an active carbon disulfide content of 85%. Dilution with nitrogen rendered contents nonflammable.  In 2007 Alfa Aesar stopped selling carbon disulfide samples.\n\n# Health effects\nAt very high levels, carbon disulfide may be life-threatening because it affects the nervous system.

{"guideline_text": "Loop diuretic\nLoop diuretics are diuretics that act on the ascending loop of Henle in the kidney. They are primarily used in medicine to treat hypertension and edema often due to congestive heart failure or renal insufficiency.\n\n# Mechanism of action\nLoop diuretics act on the Na+-K+-2Cl- symporter (cotransporter) in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle to inhibit sodium and chloride reabsorption. This is achieved by competing for the Cl- binding site. Because magnesium and calcium reabsorption in the thick ascending limb is dependent on sodium and chloride concentrations, loop diuretics also inhibit their reabsorption. By disrupting the reabsorption of these ions, loop diuretics prevent the urine from becoming concentrated and disrupt the generation of a hypertonic renal medulla. Without such a concentrated medulla, water has less of an osmotic driving force to leave the collecting duct system, ultimately resulting in increased urine production. This diuresis leaves less water to be reabsorbed into the blood, resulting in a decrease in blood volume.\nLoop diuretics also cause vasodilation of the veins and of the kidney's blood vessels, mechanically causing a decrease in blood pressure.\nThe collective effects of decreased blood volume and vasodilation decrease blood pressure and ameliorate edema.\n\n# Clinical use\nLoop diuretics are principally used in the following indications (Rossi, 2004):\n- edema associated with heart failure, hepatic cirrhosis, renal impairment, nephrotic syndrome\n- hypertension\n- adjunct in cerebral/pulmonary edema where rapid diuresis is required (IV injection)\nThey are also sometimes used in the management of severe hypercalcemia in combination with adequate rehydration (Rossi, 2004).\n\n# Loop diuretic resistance\nRenal insufficiency causes decreased bloodflow to the kidneys, which decreases the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and reduces the ability of loop diuretics to reach their target organ, the loop of Henle. Similarly, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs also decrease GFR with comparable results. In patients with reduced GFR, ceiling dosages of loop diuretics are increased proportional to the decrease in GFR. Simultaneous treatment with a thiazide diuretic such as hydrochlorothiazide (to inhibit sodium reabsorption at multiple sites in the nephron) is often successful.\nPatients with congestive heart failure tend to retain sodium, also necessitating an increase in dosage. The same is true for patients with increased sodium intake.\n\n# Adverse effects\nThe most common adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are dose-related and relate to the effect of loop diuretics on diuresis and electrolyte balance.\nCommon ADRs include: hyponatremia, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, dehydration, hyperuricemia, gout, dizziness, postural hypotension, syncope (Rossi, 2004).\nInfrequent ADRs include: dyslipidemia, increased serum creatinine concentration, hypocalcemia, rash (Rossi, 2004).\nOtotoxicity (damage to the ear) is a serious, but rare ADR associated with use of loop diuretics. This may be limited to tinnitus and vertigo, but may result in deafness in serious cases.\nLoop diuretics may also precipitate renal failure in patients concomitantly taking an NSAID and an ACE inhibitor -- the so-called \"triple whammy\" effect (Thomas, 2000).\n\n# Examples of loop diuretics\n- Furosemide\n- Bumetanide\n- Ethacrynic acid\n- Torsemide", "source": "wikidoc", "question": "According to authoritative guidelines, outline your approach to evaluating and managing a patient with acute decompensated heart failure who demonstrates poor response to loop diuretics, including the likely mechanistic causes of resistance, appropriate investigations, stepwise therapeutic strategies (dose adjustments in reduced GFR, route and agent selection, use of combination diuretics such as thiazides), measures to address reversible contributors (NSAID use, high sodium intake), monitoring for and preventing key adverse effects (electrolyte disturbances, ototoxicity, and the “triple‑whammy” risk), and the physiological rationale for each intervention."}

Do NOT use alirocumab if it has been at room temperature  for 24 hours or longer.\n- Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. If the solution is discolored or contains visible particulate matter, the solution should not be used.\n- Follow aseptic injection technique every time alirocumab is administered.\n- Administer alirocumab by subcutaneous injection into the thigh, abdomen, or upper arm using a single-dose pre-filled pen or single-dose pre-filled syringe.\n- Rotate the injection site with each injection.\n- Do NOT inject alirocumab into areas of active skin disease or injury such as sunburns, skin rashes, inflammation, or skin infections.\n- Do NOT co-administer alirocumab with other injectable drugs at the same injection site.\n\n# Dosage Forms and Strengths\nAlirocumab is a clear, colorless to pale yellow solution available as follows:\nInjection: Single-dose pre-filled pen\n- 75 mg/mL\n- 150 mg/mL\nInjection: Single-dose pre-filled syringe\n- 75 mg/mL\n- 150 mg/mL\n\n# Contraindications\nAlirocumab is contraindicated in patients with a history of a serious hypersensitivity reaction to alirocumab. Reactions have included hypersensitivity vasculitis and hypersensitivity reactions requiring hospitalization.\n\n# Warnings and Precautions\n\n## Allergic Reactions\nHypersensitivity reactions (e.g., pruritus, rash, urticaria), including some serious events (e.g., hypersensitivity vasculitis and hypersensitivity reactions requiring hospitalization), have been reported with alirocumab treatment. If signs or symptoms of serious allergic reactions occur, discontinue treatment with alirocumab, treat according to the standard of care, and monitor until signs and symptoms resolve.\n\n# Adverse Reactions\n\n## Clinical Trials Experience\n- Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.\n- The safety of alirocumab was evaluated in 9 placebo-controlled trials that included 2476 patients treated with alirocumab, including 2135 exposed for 6 months and 1999 exposed for more than 1 year (median treatment duration of 65 weeks). The mean age of the population was 59 years, 40% of the population were women, 90% were Caucasians, 4% were Black or African American, and 3% were Asians. At baseline, 37% of patients had a diagnosis of heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia and 66% had clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.\n- Adverse reactions reported in at least 2% of alirocumab-treated patients, and more frequently than in placebo-treated patients, are shown in the table below:\nAdverse reactions led to discontinuation of treatment in 5.3% of patients treated with alirocumab and 5.1% of patients treated with placebo. The most common adverse reactions leading to treatment discontinuation in patients treated with alirocumab were allergic reactions (0.6% versus 0.2% for alirocumab and placebo, respectively) and elevated liver enzymes (0.3% versus <0.1%).\n- Local Injection Site Reactions\nLocal injection site reactions including erythema/redness, itching, swelling, and pain/tenderness were reported more frequently in patients treated with alirocumab (7.2% versus 5.1% for alirocumab and placebo, respectively). Few patients discontinued treatment because of these reactions (0.2% versus 0.4% for alirocumab and placebo, respectively), but patients receiving alirocumab had a greater number of injection site reactions, had more reports of associated symptoms, and had reactions of longer average duration than patients receiving placebo.\n- Allergic Reactions\nAllergic reactions were reported more frequently in patients treated with alirocumab than in those treated with placebo (8.6% versus 7.8%). The proportion of patients who discontinued treatment due to allergic reactions was higher among those treated with alirocumab (0.6% versus 0.2% ). Serious allergic reactions, such as hypersensitivity, nummular eczema, and hypersensitivity vasculitis were reported in patients using alirocumab in controlled clinical trials .\n- Neurocognitive Events\nNeurocognitive events were reported in 0.8% of patients treated with alirocumab and 0.7% of patients treated with placebo. Confusion or memory impairment were reported more frequently by those treated with alirocumab (0.2% for each) than in those treated with placebo (<0.1% for each).\n- Liver Enzyme Abnormalities\nLiver-related disorders (primarily related to abnormalities in liver enzymes) were reported in 2.5% of patients treated with alirocumab and 1.8% of patients treated with placebo, leading to treatment discontinuation in 0.4% and 0.2% of patients, respectively. Increases in serum transaminases to greater than 3 times the upper limit of normal occurred in 1.7% of patients treated with alirocumab and 1.4% of patients treated with placebo.\n- Low LDL-C Values\nIn a pool of both placebo- and active-controlled clinical trials, 796 alirocumab-treated patients had two consecutive calculated LDL-C values <25 mg/dL, and 288 had two consecutive calculated LDL-C values <15 mg/dL. Changes to background lipid-altering therapy (e.g., maximally tolerated statins) were not made in response to low LDL-C values, and alirocumab dosing was not modified or interrupted on this basis. Although adverse consequences of very low LDL-C were not identified in these trials, the long-term effects of very low levels of LDL-C induced by alirocumab are unknown.\n\n## Immunogenicity\n- As with all therapeutic proteins, there is a potential for immunogenicity with alirocumab. In a pool of ten placebo- and active-controlled trials, 4.8% of patients treated with alirocumab had anti-drug antibodies (ADA) newly detected after initiating treatment as compared with 0.6% of patients treated with control.\n- Patients who developed ADA had a higher incidence of injection site reactions compared with patients who did not develop ADA (10.2% vs 5.9%).\n- A total of 1.2% of patients treated with alirocumab developed neutralizing antibodies (NAb) on at least one occasion as compared with no patients treated with control, and 0.3% of patients both tested positive for NAb and exhibited transient or prolonged loss of efficacy. The long-term consequences of continuing alirocumab treatment in the presence of persistent NAb are unknown.\n- Immunogenicity data are highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay as well as other factors. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors, including sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to alirocumab with the incidence of antibodies to other products may be misleading.\n\n# Use in Specific Populations\n\n## Pregnancy\nRisk Summary\nThere are no available data on use of alirocumab in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk. In animal reproduction studies, there were no effects on embryo-fetal development when rats were subcutaneously administered alirocumab during organogenesis at dose exposures up to 12-fold the exposure at the maximum recommended human dose of 150 mg every two weeks. In monkeys, suppression of the humoral immune response was observed in infant monkeys when alirocumab was dosed during organogenesis to parturition at dose exposures 13-fold the exposure at the maximum recommended human dose of 150 mg every two weeks. No additional effects on pregnancy or neonatal/infant development were observed at dose exposures up to 81-fold the maximum recommended human dose of 150 mg every two weeks. Measurable alirocumab serum concentrations were observed in the infant monkeys at birth at comparable levels to maternal serum, indicating that alirocumab, like other IgG antibodies, crosses the placental barrier. FDA's experience with monoclonal antibodies in humans indicates that they are unlikely to cross the placenta in the first trimester; however, they are likely to cross the placenta in increasing amounts in the second and third trimester. Consider the benefits and risks of alirocumab and possible risks to the fetus before prescribing alirocumab to pregnant women.\nIn the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2–4% and 15–20%, respectively.\nData\nAnimal Data\nIn Sprague Dawley rats, no effects on embryo-fetal development were observed when alirocumab was dosed at up to 75 mg/kg/dose by the subcutaneous route on gestation days 6 and 12 at exposures 12-fold the maximum recommended human dose of 150 mg every two weeks, based on serum AUC.\nIn cynomolgus monkeys, suppression of the humoral immune response to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) antigen was observed in infant monkeys at 4 to 6 months of age when alirocumab was dosed during organogenesis to parturition at 15 mg/kg/week and 75 mg/kg/week by the subcutaneous route, corresponding to 13- and 81-fold the human exposure at the maximum recommended human dose of 150 mg every two weeks, based on serum AUC. The lowest dose tested in the monkey resulted in humoral immune suppression; therefore it is unknown if this effect would be observed at clinical exposure. No study designed to challenge the immune system of infant monkeys was conducted. No additional embryo-fetal, prenatal or postnatal effects were observed in infant monkeys, and no maternal effects were observed, when alirocumab was dosed at up to 75 mg/kg/week by the subcutaneous route, corresponding to maternal exposure of 81-fold the exposure at the maximum recommended human dose of 150 mg every two weeks, based on serum AUC.\n\n## Lactation\nRisk Summary\nThere is no information regarding the presence of alirocumab in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. The development and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for alirocumab and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from alirocumab or from the underlying maternal condition. Human IgG is present in human milk, but published data suggest that breastmilk IgG antibodies do not enter the neonatal and infant circulation in substantial amounts.\n\n## Pediatric Use\nSafety and efficacy in pediatric patients have not been established.\n\n## Geriatric Use\nIn controlled studies, 1158 patients treated with alirocumab were ≥65 years of age and 241 patients treated with alirocumab were ≥75 years of age. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.\n\n## Renal Impairment\nNo dose adjustment is needed for patients with mild or moderately impaired renal function. No data are available in patients with severe renal impairment.\n\n## Hepatic Impairment\nNo dose adjustment is needed for patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. No data are available in patients with severe hepatic impairment.\n\n# Description\nAlirocumab is a human monoclonal antibody (IgG1 isotype) that targets proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9 (PCSK9). Alirocumab is a PCSK9 inhibitor produced by recombinant DNA technology in Chinese Hamster Ovary cell suspension culture. Alirocumab consists of two disulfide-linked human heavy chains, each covalently linked through a disulfide bond to a human kappa light chain. A single N-linked glycosylation site is located in each heavy chain within the CH2 domain of the Fc constant region of the molecule. The variable domains of the heavy and light chains combine to form the PCSK9 binding site within the antibody. Alirocumab has an approximate molecular weight of 146 kDa.\nAlirocumab is a sterile, preservative-free, clear, colorless to pale yellow solution for subcutaneous injection. Alirocumab 75 mg/mL or 150 mg/mL solution for subcutaneous injection in a single-dose pre-filled pen or single-dose pre-filled syringe is supplied in a siliconized 1 mL Type-1 clear glass syringe. The needle shield is not made with natural rubber latex.\nEach 75 mg/mL pre-filled pen or pre-filled syringe contains 75 mg alirocumab, histidine (8 mM), polysorbate 20 (0.1 mg), sucrose (100 mg), and Water for Injection USP, to pH 6.0.\nEach 150 mg/mL pre-filled pen or pre-filled syringe contains 150 mg alirocumab, histidine (6 mM), polysorbate 20 (0.1 mg), sucrose (100 mg), and Water for Injection USP, to pH 6.0.\n\n# Clinical Pharmacology\n\n## Mechanism of Action\nAlirocumab is a human monoclonal antibody that binds to proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9 (PCSK9). PCSK9 binds to the low-density lipoprotein receptors (LDLR) on the surface of hepatocytes to promote LDLR degradation within the liver. LDLR is the primary receptor that clears circulating LDL, therefore the decrease in LDLR levels by PCSK9 results in higher blood levels of LDL-C. By inhibiting the binding of PCSK9 to LDLR, alirocumab increases the number of LDLRs available to clear LDL, thereby lowering LDL-C levels.\n\n## Pharmacodynamics\nAlirocumab reduced free PCSK9 in a concentration-dependent manner. Following a single subcutaneous administration of alirocumab 75 or 150 mg, maximal suppression of free PCSK9 occurred within 4 to 8 hours. Free PCSK9 concentrations returned to baseline when alirocumab concentrations decreased below the limit of quantitation.\n\n## Pharmacokinetics\nAbsorption\nAfter subcutaneous (SC) administration of 75 mg to 150 mg alirocumab, median times to maximum serum concentrations (tmax) were 3–7 days. The pharmacokinetics of alirocumab after single SC administration of 75 mg into the abdomen, upper arm, or thigh were similar. The absolute bioavailability of alirocumab after SC administration was about 85% as determined by population pharmacokinetics analysis. A slightly greater than dose proportional increase was observed, with a 2.1- to 2.7-fold increase in total alirocumab concentrations for a 2-fold increase in dose. Steady state was reached after 2 to 3 doses with an accumulation ratio of about 2-fold.\nDistribution\nFollowing IV administration, the volume of distribution was about 0.04 to 0.05 L/kg indicating that alirocumab is distributed primarily in the circulatory system.\nMetabolism and Elimination\n- Specific metabolism studies were not conducted, because alirocumab is a protein. Alirocumab is expected to degrade to small peptides and individual amino acids. In clinical studies where alirocumab was administered in combination with atorvastatin or rosuvastatin, no relevant changes in statin concentrations were observed in the presence of repeated administration of alirocumab, indicating that cytochrome P450 enzymes (mainly CYP3A4 and CYP2C9) and transporter proteins such as P-gp and OATP were not affected by alirocumab.\n- Two elimination phases were observed for alirocumab. At low concentrations, the elimination is predominately through saturable binding to target (PCSK9), while at higher concentrations the elimination of alirocumab is largely through a non-saturable proteolytic pathway.\n- Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis, the median apparent half-life of alirocumab at steady state was 17 to 20 days in patients receiving alirocumab at subcutaneous doses of 75 mg Q2W or 150 mg Q2W.\nSpecific Populations\nA population pharmacokinetic analysis was conducted on data from 2799 subjects. Age, body weight, gender, race, and creatinine clearance were found not to significantly influence alirocumab pharmacokinetics. No dose adjustments are recommended for these demographics.\nPediatric\nAlirocumab has not been studied in pediatric patients.\nRenal Impairment\nSince monoclonal antibodies are not known to be eliminated via renal pathways, renal function is not expected to impact the pharmacokinetics of alirocumab.\nNo data are available in patients with severe renal impairment.\nHepatic Impairment\nFollowing administration of a single 75 mg SC dose, alirocumab pharmacokinetic profiles in subjects with mild and moderate hepatic impairment were similar to those in subjects with normal hepatic function.\nNo data are available in patients with severe hepatic impairment.\nDrug-Drug Interactions\nThe median apparent half-life of alirocumab is reduced to 12 days when administered with a statin; however, this difference is not clinically meaningful and does not impact dosing recommendations.\n\n# Non Clinical Toxicology\n\n## Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility\nCarcinogenicity studies have not been conducted with alirocumab. The mutagenic potential of alirocumab has not been evaluated; however, monoclonal antibodies are not expected to alter DNA or chromosomes.\nThere were no adverse effects on surrogate markers of fertility (e.g., estrous cyclicity, testicular volume, ejaculate volume, sperm motility, or total sperm count per ejaculate) in a 6-month chronic toxicology study in sexually-mature monkeys subcutaneously administered at 5, 15, and 75 mg/kg/week at systemic exposures up to 103-fold the 150 mg every two weeks subcutaneous clinical dose based on serum AUC. In addition, there were no adverse alirocumab-related anatomic pathology or histopathology findings in reproductive tissues in rat or monkey toxicology studies at systemic exposures up to 11-fold and 103-fold respectively, in the 6-month studies, compared to clinical systemic exposure following a 150 mg every two weeks dose, based on serum AUC.\n\n## Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology\nDuring a 13-week toxicology study of 75 mg/kg once weekly alirocumab in combination with 40 mg/kg once daily atorvastatin in adult monkeys, there were no effects of Alirocumab on the humoral immune response to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) after one to two months at exposures 100-fold greater than the exposure at the maximum recommended human dose of 150 mg every two weeks, based on AUC.\n\n# Clinical Studies\nThe efficacy of Alirocumab was investigated in five double-blind placebo-controlled trials that enrolled 3499 patients; 36% were patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH) and 54% were non-FH patients who had clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Three of the five trials were conducted exclusively in patients with HeFH. All patients were receiving a maximally tolerated dose of a statin, with or without other lipid-modifying therapies. In the trials that enrolled patients with HeFH, the diagnosis of HeFH was made either by genotyping or clinical criteria (\"definite FH\" using either the Simon Broome or WHO/Dutch Lipid Network criteria). All trials were at least 52 weeks in duration with the primary efficacy endpoint measured at week 24 (mean percent change in LDL-C from baseline).\nThree studies used an initial dose of 75 mg every 2 weeks (Q2W) followed by criteria-based up-titration to 150 mg Q2W at week 12 for patients who did not achieve their pre-defined target LDL-C at week 8. The majority of patients (57% to 83%) who were treated for at least 12 weeks did not require up-titration. Two studies used only a 150 mg Q2W dose.\nStudy 1 was a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that randomly assigned 1553 patients to Alirocumab 150 mg Q2W and 788 patients to placebo. All patients were taking maximally tolerated doses of statins with or without other lipid-modifying therapy, and required additional LDL-C reduction. The mean age was 61 years (range 18–89), 38% were women, 93% were Caucasian, 3% were Black, and 5% were Hispanic/Latino. Overall, 69% were non-FH patients with clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and 18% had HeFH. The average LDL-C at baseline was 122 mg/dL.\nThe proportion of patients who prematurely discontinued study drug prior to the 24-week endpoint was 8% among those treated with Alirocumab and 8% among those treated with placebo.\nAt week 24, the treatment difference between Alirocumab and placebo in mean LDL-C percent change was -58% (95% CI: -61%, -56%; p-value: <0.0001).\nStudy 2 was a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that randomly assigned 209 patients to Alirocumab and 107 patients to placebo. Patients were taking maximally tolerated doses of statins with or without other lipid-modifying therapy, and required additional LDL-C reduction.\nThe mean age was 63 years (range 39–87), 34% were women, 82% were Caucasian, 16% were Black, and 11% were Hispanic/Latino. Overall 84% had clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Mean baseline LDL-C was 102 mg/dL.\nThe proportion of patients who prematurely discontinued study drug prior to the 24-week endpoint was 11% among those treated with Alirocumab and 12% among those treated with placebo.\nAt week 12, the mean percent change from baseline in LDL-C was -45% with Alirocumab compared to 1% with placebo, and the treatment difference between Alirocumab 75mg Q2W and placebo in mean LDL-C percent change was -46% (95% CI: -53%, -39%).\nAt week 12, if additional LDL-C lowering was required based on pre-specified LDL-C criteria, Alirocumab was up-titrated to 150 mg Q2W for the remainder of the trial. At week 24, the mean percent change from baseline in LDL-C was -44% with Alirocumab and -2% with placebo, and the treatment difference between Alirocumab and placebo in mean LDL-C percent change was -43% (95% CI: -50%, -35%; p-value: <0.0001). The dose was up-titrated to 150 mg Q2W in 32 (17%) of 191 patients treated with Alirocumab for at least 12 weeks.\nStudies 3 and 4 were multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials that, combined, randomly assigned 490 patients to Alirocumab and 245 patients to placebo. The trials were similar with regard to both design and eligibility criteria. All patients had HeFH, were taking a maximally tolerated dose of statin with or without other lipid-modifying therapy, and required additional LDL-C reduction. The mean age was 52 years (range 20–87), 45% were women, 94% were Caucasian, 1% were Black, and 3% were Hispanic/Latino. Overall, 45% of these patients with HeFH also had clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. The average LDL-C at baseline was 141 mg/dL.\nConsidering both trials together, the proportion of patients who prematurely discontinued study drug prior to the 24-week endpoint was 6% among those treated with Alirocumab and 4% among those treated with placebo.\nAt week 12, the treatment difference between Alirocumab 75 mg Q2W and placebo in mean LDL-C percent change was -48% (95% CI: -52%, -44%).\nAt week 12, if additional LDL-C lowering was required based on pre-specified LDL-C criteria, Alirocumab was up-titrated to 150 mg Q2W for the remainder of the trials. At week 24, the mean treatment difference between Alirocumab and placebo in mean LDL-C percent change from baseline was -54% (95% CI: -59%, -50%; p-value: <0.0001). The dose was up-titrated to 150 mg Q2W in 196 (42%) of 469 patients treated with Alirocumab for at least 12 weeks. The LDL-C-lowering effect was sustained to week 52.\nStudy 5 was a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that randomly assigned 72 patients to Alirocumab 150 mg Q2W and 35 patients to placebo. Patients had HeFH with a baseline LDL-C ≥160 mg/dL while taking a maximally tolerated dose of statin with or without other lipid-modifying therapy. The mean age was 51 years (range 18–80), 47% were women, 88% were Caucasian, 2% were Black, and 6% were Hispanic/Latino. Overall, 50% had clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. The average LDL-C at baseline was 198 mg/dL.\nThe proportion of patients who discontinued study drug prior to the 24-week endpoint was 10% among those treated with Alirocumab and 0% among those treated with placebo.\nAt week 24, the mean percent change from baseline in LDL-C was -43% with Alirocumab and -7% with placebo, and the treatment difference between Alirocumab and placebo in mean LDL-C percent change was -36% (95% CI: -49%, -24%; p-value: <0.0001).\n\n# How Supplied/Storage and Handling\nAlirocumab is a clear, colorless to pale yellow solution, supplied in single-dose pre-filled pens and single-dose pre-filled glass syringes.

The trial demonstrated a significant 73.2% reduction from baseline serum LDL-C cholesterol with 80 mg of atorvastatin plus alirocumab compared with 17.3% with the 80 mg atorvastatin plus placebo. Ninety percent of the patients who received alirocumab reached LDL-C concentrations lower than 70 mg/dL compared with 17% of those receiving atorvastatin alone. There were no significant safety signals and the drug was well tolerated.\nThis randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 2 trial of 77 adults with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia and LDL-C concentrations of ≥100 mg/dL or higher on stable diet and statin dose, with or without ezetimibe therapy were randomized (1:1:1:1:1) to 5 different treatment arms for 12 weeks: 150 mg SC alirocumab every 4 weeks, 200 mg SC alirocumab every 4 weeks, 300 mg SC alirocumab every 4 weeks, 150 mg SC alirocumab every 2 weeks, or SC placebo. Randomization was stratified by baseline use of ezetimibe. Alirocumab demonstrated a significant reduction in LDL-C at week 12 (28.9%, 31.5%, and 42.5% for the 150, 200, and 300 mg every 4 weeks respectively, and 67.9% for the 150 mg every 2 weeks dose, compared with 10.7% in the placebo arm) with no significant safety signal. There were no increases >3 x ULN in hepatic transaminases or creatine kinase (CK).\nThis randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 2 trial of 183 patients with LDL-C ≥100 mg/dL on stable-dose atorvastatin for 6 or more weeks randomized patients to a 12 week treatment course in either one of 6 arms (1:1:1:1:1:1): subcutaneous (SC) placebo every 2 weeks, 50 mg SC alirocumab every 2 weeks, 100 mg SC alirocumab every 2 weeks, 150 mg SC alirocumab every 2 weeks, 200 mg SC alirocumab every 4 weeks alternating with placebo, or 300 mg SC alirocumab every 4 weeks alternating with placebo. Alirocumab demonstrated a significant dose-related reduction in serum LDL-C (40%, 64%, and 72% with 50, 100, and 150 mg respectively, and 43% and 48% with 200 and 300 mg respectively compared with 5% in placebo) with no major safety signals. \n\n## Phase III Trials\n\n### ODYSSEY - COMBO I\nCOMBO I was a randomized, double blind, trial that randomized 316 adult patients with moderate to very high CV risk and elevated LDL-C despite maximal statin use to either SC alirocumab 75mg every 2 weeks for 52 weeks or a matched placebo. Alirocumab dose was increased at week 12 to 150mg every two weeks if LDL targets failed to be met by week 8. Alirocumab was generally well tolerated, with no reported safety signals in the 75mg or 150mg dose. Alirocumab treatment was associated with a significantly higher reduction in LDL-C from baseline to 24 weeks ( -48.2% for alirocumab vs. -2.3% for placebo; Δ:45.9%; 95% CI: 39.3-52.5; p<0.0001). Patients on alirocumab were more likely to reach LDL targets (75% for alirocumab vs. 9% for placebo). Patients on alirocumab demonstrated a substantial drop in LDL-C within the first 4 weeks, which was sustained to week 52.\nCOMBO II was a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, trial that randomized 720 patients with elevated CV risk and LDL-C despite maximal statins use to either SC alirocumab 75 mg every 2 weeks (and PO placebo) or PO ezetimibe 10 mg daily (and SC placebo). Alirocumab was generally well tolerated, with no reported safety signals. Alirocumab treatment was associated with a significantly higher reduction in mean LDL-C values from baselines at week 24 (50.6 ± 1.4% for alirocumab vs. 20.7 ± 1.9% for ezetimibe; P < 0.0001). Patients on alirocumab were more likely to achieve LDL-C <1.8 mmol/L (77.0% vs. 45.6%; P < 0.0001). At week 24, mean LDL-C levels were 1.3 ± 0.04 mmol/L among patients receiving alirocumab, and 2.1 ± 0.05 mmol/L among patients receiving ezetimibe.\n\n### ODYSSEY -ALTERNATIVE\nALTERNATIVE was a randomized, double blind, double dummy trial that randomized 314 adult patients with moderate to very high CV risk and who underwent 2 weeks washout from lipid lowering therapies in a 2:1:1 ratio to 75mg alirocumab every two weeks, or 10mg oral ezetimibe daily, or 20mg oral atorvastatin daily for 24 weeks. Alirocumab was associated with the lowest rates of skeletal muscle associated AEs, followed by ezetimibe and atorvastatin, respectively. Alirocumab was generally well tolerated, with no significant safety signals. Alirocumab treatment was associated with a significantly higher reduction in mean LDL-C from baseline to week 24 compared to ezetimibe (-45.0% for alirocumab vs. -14.6% for ezetimibe; Δ:30.4%; 95% CI: 24.2-36.6; p<0.0001). Patients on alirocumab were more likely to achieve LDL targets (41.9% vs. 4.4%). Alirocumab patients demonstrated a substantial drop in LDL-C in the first 4 weeks, which was sustained for 24 weeks.\n\n### ODYSSEY - MONO\nODYSSEY- MONO was a randomized, double blind, double dummy trial that enrolled 103 adult patients with a 10 year fatal CV risk of 1.00% to 4.99% and LDL-C>100mg/dl. Patients had no established history of coronary heart disease or any CHD risk equivalents. Additionally, patients were not receiving lipid lowering therapy for 4 weeks prior to randomization. Patients were randomized to receive 75mg of SC alirocumab twice weekly or oral ezetimibe 10mg once daily. Alirocumab dose was increased at week 12 to 150mg every two weeks if LDL targets failed to be met by week 8. Alirocumab treatment was associated with a significantly higher reduction in mean LDL-C from baseline to week 24 compared to ezetimibe (-47.2% for alirocumab vs. -15.6% for ezetimibe; Δ:31.6%; 95% CI: 23.0-40.2; p<0.0001). Alirocumab patients demonstrated a substantial drop in LDL-C in the first 4 weeks, which was sustained for 24 weeks. Alirocumab was well tolerated with no safety signals.\nODYSSEY FHI and FH II were multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials that enrolled a total of 735 heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia patients and randomized them to either SC alirocumab 75-150 mg every 2 weeks or matching placebo for a total of 78 weeks, on top of a background of lipid lowering therapy.The primary endpoint was the prrcent change in LDL-C from baseline to week 24. Alirocumab administration was associated with a 57.9% reduction compared to placebo in the FH I population (P<0.0001), and a 51.4% reduction compared to placebo in the FH II population (P<0.0001). Alirocumab was well tolerated and there were no safety concerns.\nLong term was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that enrolled 2341 patients at high risk for CV events with baseline LDL-C ≥70 mg/dL. Patients were randomized in 2:1 ratio to receive either 150mg SC alirocumab or equivalent placebo once every 2 weeks for 78 weeks. The primary efficacy end point was the percentage change in calculated LDL cholesterol level from baseline to week 24. Alirocumab treatment was associated with a 62% reduction in LDL-C compared to placebo (P<0.001). In an exploratory analysis, alirocumab was associated with a significant reduction in the rate of major adverse cardiovascular events (1.7% vs. 3.3%; hazard ratio, 0.52; 95% confidence interval, 0.31 to 0.90; nominal P=0.02). Alirocumab treatment was associated with a significantly higher incidence of myalgia (5.4% vs. 2.9%; P=0.006). \n\n### ODYSSEY - OPTIONS I\nOPTIONS I was a randomized, double blind, trial that enrolled 355 patients with high or very high CVD risk and elevated LDL-C. All patients were receiving 20 or 40 mg of atorvastatin for at least 4 weeks prior to study enrollment. Patients were stratified by their baseline dose of 20mg atorvastatin vs. 40mg atorvastatin prior to randomization. Patients receiving 20mg of atorvastatin were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive add-on therapy of 75mg SC alirocumab twice weekly, or add-on therapy of 10mg oral ezetimibe once daily, or doubling the atorvastatin dose to 40mg once daily. Patients receiving a baseline 40mg of atorvastatin were randomized in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to receive add-on therapy of 75mg SC aloricumab twice weekly, or add-on therapy of 10mg oral ezetimibe once daily, or doubling atorvastatin dose to 80mg once daily, or switching to 40mg oral rosuvastatin once daily. Patients were followed for 24 weeks.\nAmong patients receiving a 20mg baseline dose of atorvastatin , add-on therapy of alirocumab was associated with a 44.1% reduction in mean LDL-C compared to 20.5% for ezetimibe, and 5.0% for 40mg atorvastatin. Patients on alirocumab add-on treatment were most likely to achieve LDL-C targets (79.2% for alirocumab vs. 50.3% for ezetimibe vs. 16.0% for 40mg atorvastatin).\nAmong patients receiving 40mg baseline dose of atorvastatin, add-on therapy of alirocumab was associated with a 54.0% reduction in mean LDL-C compared to 22.6% for ezetimibe, 4.8% for atorvastatin, and 21.5% for rosuvastatin. Patients on alirocumab add-on treatment were most likely to achieve LDL-C targets (77.2% for alirocumab vs. 54.2% for ezetimibe vs. 10.2% for 80mg atorvastatin, and 42.2% for rosuvastatin).\nAlirocumab was well tolerated and showed no safety signals. Regardless of baseline dose of atorvastatin, patients experienced a substantial drop in mean LDL-C within the first 4 weeks which was sustained for 24 weeks.\n\n### ODYSSEY - OPTIONS II\nOPTIONS II was a randomized, double blind, trial that enrolled 305 patients with high or very high CVD risk and elevated LDL-C. All patients were receiving 10 or 20 mg of rosuvastatin for at least 4 weeks prior to study enrollment. Patients were stratified by their baseline dose of 10mg rosuvastatin vs. 20mg rosuvastatin prior to randomization. Patients receiving 10mg of rosuvastatin were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive add-on therapy of 75mg SC alirocumab twice weekly, or add-on therapy of 10mg oral ezetimibe once daily, or doubling the rosuvastatin dose to 20mg once daily. Patients receiving a baseline 20mg of rosuvastatin were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive add-on therapy of 75mg SC aloricumab twice weekly, or add-on therapy of 10mg oral ezetimibe once daily, or doubling rosuvastatin dose to 40mg once daily, Patients were followed for 24 weeks.\nAmong patients receiving a 10mg baseline dose of rosuvastatin , add-on therapy of alirocumab was associated with a 50.6% reduction in mean LDL-C compared to 14.4% for ezetimibe, and 16.3% for 20mg rosuvastatin. Patients on alirocumab add-on treatment were most likely to achieve LDL-C targets (77.8% for alirocumab vs. 43.1% for ezetimibe vs. 31.3% for 20mg rosuvastatin).\nAmong patients receiving 20mg baseline dose of rosuvastatin, add-on therapy of alirocumab was associated with a 36.3% reduction in mean LDL-C compared to 11.0% for ezetimibe, and 15.9% for rosuvastatin. Patients on alirocumab add-on treatment were most likely to achieve LDL-C targets (60.1% for alirocumab vs. 43.6% for ezetimibe vs. 29.9% for 40mg rosuvastatin). Results of the 20mg group missed the mark for statistical significance.\nAlirocumab was well tolerated and showed no safety signals.\n\n### ODYSSEY - CHOICE I\nCHOICE I was a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled clinical trial that enrolled 803 adult patients with uncontrolled hypercholesterolemia and moderate to very high CVD risk receiving maximum dose of statins, have skeletal muscle symptoms associated with statin use or discontinued statin use. Patients were randomized in a 4:2:1 ratio to receive 300mg SC alirocumab every 4 weeks, or 75mg SC alirocumab every 2 weeks, or placebo for 48 weeks. Alirocumab treatment was well tolerated and showed no significant safety signals.\nAmong patients not receiving statins at baseline; those receiving alirocumab demonstrated a 52.7% reduction in mean LDL-C compared to 0.3% in placebo. Among patients receiving statins at baseline; those receiving alirocumab demonstrated a 48.8% reduction in mean LDL-C compared to 0.1% in placebo.\n\n### ODYSSEY - CHOICE II\nCHOICE II was a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled clinical trial that enrolled 233 adult patients with uncontrolled hypercholesterolemia and discontinued statins. This trial enrolled a large subgroup of patients who previously experienced statin associated myopathy. Patients were randomized in a 2:1:1 ratio to receive 150mg SC alirocumab every four weeks, or placebo, or 75mg SC alirocumab every two weeks. Primary effficacy endpoint was the percent change in mean LDL-C from baseline to week 24 in the ITT population compared to placebo. Alirocumab was well tolerated and demonstrated no safety signals. There was a low incidence of musculoskeletal symptoms across all groups. More injection site reactions were associated with the 150mg dose compared to placebo or the 75mg dose.\nPatients receiving alirocumab had a 51.7% mean reduction in LDL-C compared to 4.7% in patients receiving placebo. The 75mg twice weekly dose demonstrated a higher efficacy against placebo compared to the 150mg every 4 weeks dose. More patients achieved target LDL-C levels in the 75mg dose group compared to 150mg and placebo groups (70.3% vs. 63.9% vs. 1.8%, respectively).\n\n### ODYSSEY - HIGH FH\nHIGH FH was a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled clinical trial that enrolled 107 adult patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia with poorly controlled cholesterol levels (LDL>150mg/dl) despite maximum stable dose of statins. Patients were randomized in a 2:1 fashion to receive 150mg SC alirocumab every two weeks or placebo for 78 weeks. Alirocumab was well tolerated and demonstrated no safety signals.\nPatients on alirocumab had a 45.7% reduction in LDL-C from baseline to week 24 compared to 6.6% reduction in the placebo group. 41.0% of patients in the alirocumab group achieved LDL targets compared to 5.7% in the placebo group.\n\n### ODYSSEY - JAPAN\nODYSSEY JAPAN was a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled clinical trial that enrolled 216 adult patients at 31 sites in Japan. Patients had heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia and those with high cardiovascular risk with a history of coronary artery disease. Patients had uncontrolled hypercholesterolemia with an elevated LDL-C despite lipid lowering therapy. Eligible patients were randomized in a 2:1 fashion to receive 75mg SC alirocumab every two weeks or placebo, for a duration of 52 weeks. Surprisingly, patients receiving placebo experienced more SAEs compared to patients in the alirocumab group (12.5% for placebo and 7.0% for alirocumab). Alirocumab was well tolerated, and no safety concerns were observed.\nPatients receiving alirocumab demonstrated a 62.5% reduction in mean LDL-C from baseline to week 24 compared to placebo; 1.6%. This was demonstrated with a substantial drop in the first 4 weeks and sustained for 52 weeks. 96.7% of patients receiving alirocumab achieved LDL-C targets compared to 10.2% of patients in the placebo group.\n\n### ODYSSEY - ESCAPE\nESCAPE was a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled trial of 62 adult patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia with high cardiovascular risk on previous statin treatment and currently undergoing apheresis therapy every week or two weeks for at least 4 weeks prior to randomization. Patients are randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive 150mg SQ alirocumab once every two weeks or placebo. Alirocumab was well tolerated and generated no significant safety signal.\nPatients receiving alirocumab demonstrated a 75% reduction in the rate of apheresis from weeks 7 to 18 compared to placebo. Patients experienced a substantial drop in LDL-C for the first two weeks and the effect was sustained for 52 weeks. Additionally, patients on alirocumab demonstrated a 50% reduction in rate of apheresis in weeks 15-18, compared to placebo.\n\n# Cost-Effectiveness\nDoses are administered every two weeks with a cost of $40 a day or $14,600 a year, substantially higher than some generic statins, which can cost as little as $0.10 a day. alirocumab is more expensive to manufacture than statins because it is made in live genetically engineered cells. Manufacturers argue that the drug is cost-effective because it will reduce medical costs of hospitalizations from stroke or myocardial infarction and that the price of the drug reflects its value. alirocumab used in combination with statins can lower cholesterol 40-70%  compared to statins that lower LDL an average of 40% . Still, further research into the actual ability of the drug to reduce risk and complications is ongoing.  Reduced prices and plans through insurers should help make the drug accessible to patients with lower ability to pay.\n\n# Future Investigations\nThe following trials are currently underway and study designs, rationale, and results are not yet published.\n\n## ODYSSEY - OUTCOMES\nOUTCOMES will be a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, clinical trial enrolling 18,000 patients over 40 years of age who are hospitalized for acute coronary syndrome with elevated cardiac biomarkers, or ECG changes consistent with ischemia or infarction, and evidence of obstructive coronary artery disease. Patients must demonstrate inadequate control of artherogenic lipoproteins despite maximal statin regimen. Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive 75mg SQ alirocumab every two weeks or a matched placebo for a period of 2 to 5 years. Alirocumab dose may be increased to 150mg SQ q2w if LDL-C is sustained above 50mg/dL after 4 weeks. Doses of alirocumab may be downtitrated from 150mg q2w to 75mg q2w if LDL-C is below 25mg/dL.\nThe primary endpoint is time to first of a composite of coronary heart disease death, non-fatal MI, Ischemic stroke, or unstable angina requiring hospitalization. Pre-specified secondary outcomes include time to each component of the primary endpoint. Additional genomic analysis will be performed on a subset of patients who consent to it.\nThe ODYSSEY Outcomes trial seeks to determine whether clinical outcomes are improved by lowering levels of LDL-C and other atherogenic lipoproteins below those achieved on optimal statin therapy alone. The trial is not designed to explore the safety of sustained, very low LDL-C levels. The trial will determine whether further reduction in cardiovascular risk can be achieved by addition of the monoclonal PCSK9 antibody, alirocumab, resulting in further reduction of LDL-C and other atherogenic lipoproteins.\n\n## DM DYSLIPIDEMIA\nEfficacy and safety of alirocumab in high cardiovascular risk patients with diabetes.\n\n## DM INSULIN\nEfficacy and safety of alirocumab in insulin-treated patients with Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes and high cardiovascular risk.\n\n## KT\nA randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of alirocumab in high cardiovascular risk patients with hypercholesterolemia not adequately controlled with their lipid modifying therapy in South Korea and Taiwan.", "source": "wikidoc", "question": "According to authoritative guidelines, discuss how you would determine eligibility for alirocumab in an adult patient with hypercholesterolemia on maximally tolerated statin therapy, and outline the recommended dosing strategy (including initial dose, criteria and timing for up‑titration, missed‑dose instructions), contraindications, principal adverse effects and immunogenicity concerns, and the monitoring and counselling points you would communicate before initiating treatment."}

{"guideline_text": "Toxicity\nToxicity is a measure of the degree to which something is toxic or poisonous. The study of poisons is known as toxicology. Toxicity can refer to the effect on a whole organism, such as a human or a bacterium or a plant, or to a substructure, such as a cell (cytotoxicity) or an organ (organotoxicity such as the liver (hepatotoxicity). By extension, the word may be metaphorically used to describe toxic effects on larger and more complex groups, such as the family unit or \"society at large\".\nIn the science of toxicology, the impact of an external substance or condition and its deleterious effects on living things: organisms, organ systems, individual organs, tissues, cells, subcellular units is the subject of study.  A central concept of toxicology is that effects are dose-dependent; even water – generally not considered to be toxic – can lead to water intoxication when taken in large enough doses, whereas for even a very toxic substance such as snake venom there is a dose below which there is no detectable toxic effect.\nToxicity is the ability of a chemical or physical agent to induce detrimental temporary or permanent tissue change or to detrimentally interfere with normal biochemical processing.\n\n# Types of toxicity\nThere are generally three types of toxic entities; chemical, biological, and physical.\n- Chemicals include inorganic substances such as lead, hydrofluoric acid, and chlorine gas, organic compounds such as methyl alcohol, most medications, and poisons from living things.\n- Biological toxic entities include those bacteria and viruses that are able to induce disease in living organisms.  Biological toxicity can be complicated to measure because the \"threshold dose\" may be a single organism. Theoretically one virus, bacterium or worm can reproduce to cause a serious infection.  However, in a host with an intact immune system the inherent toxicity of the organism is balanced by the host's ability to fight back; the effective toxicity is then a combination of both parts of the relationship. A similar situation is also present with other types of toxic agents.\n- Physically toxic entities include things not usually thought of under the heading of \"toxic\" by many people: direct blows, concussion, sound and vibration, heat and cold, non-ionizing electromagnetic radiation such as infrared and visible light, and ionizing radiation such as X-rays and alpha, beta, and gamma radiation.\nToxicity can be measured by the effects on the target (organism, organ, tissue or cell).  Because individuals typically have different levels of response to the same dose of a toxin, a population-level measure of toxicity is often used which relates the probability of an outcome for a given individual in a population.  One such measure is the LD50.  When such data does not exist, estimates are made by comparison to known similar toxic things, or to similar exposures in similar organisms.  Then \"safety factors\" are added to account for uncertainties in data and evaluation processes.  For example, if a dose of toxin is safe for a laboratory rat, one might assume that one tenth that dose would be safe for a human, allowing a safety factor of 10 to allow for interspecies differences between two mammals; if the data are from fish, one might use a factor of 100 to account for the greater difference between two chordate classes (fish and mammals).  Similarly, an extra protection factor may be used for individuals believed to be more susceptible to toxic effects such as in pregnancy or with certain diseases.  Or, a newly synthesized and previously unstudied chemical that is believed to be very similar in effect to another compound could be assigned an additional protection factor of 10 to account for possible differences in effects that are probably much smaller.  Obviously, this approach is very approximate; but such protection factors are deliberately very conservative and the method has been found to be useful in a wide variety of applications.\nThe toxicity of cancer-causing agents is problematic, since for many such substances it is not certain if there is a minimal effective dose or whether the risk is just too small to see. There too the possibility exists that a single cell transformed into a cancer cell is all it takes to develop the full effect.  Mixtures of chemicals are more difficult to assess in terms of toxicity than are single pure chemicals.  Common mixture include gasoline, cigarette smoke, and industrial waste.  Even more complex are situations with more than one type of toxic entity, such as the discharge from a malfunctioning sewage treatment plant, with both chemical and biological agents.\n\n# Factors influencing toxicity\nToxicity of a substance can be affected by many different factors, such as the pathway of administration (whether the toxin is applied to the skin, ingested, inhaled, injected), the time of exposure (a brief encounter or long term), the number of exposures (a single dose or multiple doses over time), the physical form of the toxin (solid, liquid, gas), the genetic makeup of an individual, an individual's overall health, and many others.  Several of the terms used to describe these factors have been included here.\n\n# Etymology\n\"Toxic\" and similar words came from Greek τοξον = \"bow (weapon)\" and via \"poisoned arrow,\" which came to be used for \"poison\" in scientific language, as the usual Classical Greek word ('ιον) for \"poison\" would transcribe as \"io-\", which is not distinctive enough. In some biological names, \"toxo-\" still means \"bow\", as in Toxodon = \"bow-toothed\" from the shape.", "source": "wikidoc", "question": "According to authoritative guidelines on toxicity, outline how you would perform a risk assessment for a newly synthesized industrial chemical, addressing (1) how you would classify the toxic entity, (2) which factors influencing toxicity you would evaluate (route, dose, duration, physical form, host susceptibility, etc.), (3) how you would use available toxicity data including LD50 estimates, analogue comparisons and the application of safety/protection factors for interspecies and vulnerable-population extrapolation, and (4) specific considerations when assessing mixtures and potential carcinogenic risk."}
{"guideline_text": "Statin induced myopathy overview\n\n# Overview\nStatin induced myopathy is a common entity that presents as a spectrum of symptoms ranging from complete absence of symptoms to myalgia, myositis and rhabdomyolysis. Myopathy, which is a general term that describes any pathology of the muscle, occurs in around 10 to 15% of patients taking statins. The pathophysiology of statin induced myopathy is complex. As for the treatment, it is guided by the severity of the symptoms and the degree of increase in creatine kinase levels.\nN-of-1 trials have examined this:\n- StatinWISE\n- TaSINI\n- Wood\n\n# Classification\nStatin induced myopathy is a spectrum of muscular problems caused by the intake of statins. Myopathy is, by definition, any pathology of the muscle. The spectrum of statin induced myopathy can be classified into: myalgia, asymptomatic increase in creatine kinase, myositis and rhabdomyolysis. Myalgia is defined as one or combination of symptoms of muscle weakness, tenderness or pain in the context of normal or minimally elevated creatinine kinase. Myositis is defined as the presence of symptoms of muscle weakness, tenderness or pain in the setting of an elevated creatine kinase up to ten folds the normal level. Rhabdomyolysis is a potentially lethal acute degeneration of the skeletal muscle.\n\n# Pathophysiology\nStatin induced myopathy has a complex poorly understood multifactorial pathophysiology. It is postulated that statin induced myopathy is caused by apoptosis of the skeletal muscle cells due to disrupted intracellular calcium signaling and mitochondrial dysfunction secondary to the depletion of mevalonate metabolism products, particularly coenzyme Q10.\n\n# Epidemiology\nThe prevalence of statin induced myopathy, described as a spectrum of clinical conditions ranging from myalgia to myositis and rhabdomyolysis, is almost 10-15%.\n\n# Risk Factors\nSeveral risk factors predispose to statin induced myopathy. Some of the intrinsic risk factors are advanced age, genetic predisposition, diabetes, hypertension, hypothyroidism and renal diseases. Other extrinsic factors play a role in statin induced myopathy, including alcohol consumption, vitamin D deficiency, excessive exercise, trauma or concomitant use of other drugs like fibrates, mainly gemfibrosil, protease inhibitors and macrolide antibiotics.\n\n# Screening\nScreening by measuring the creatine kinase level is not recommended by the national lipid association for statin induced myopathy unless the patient has significant predisposing factors like renal diseases, thyroid problems, metabolic diseases or pre-existing muscular diseases.\n\n# Differential Diagnosis\nMyalgia is a common complaint and should not be attributed directly to the use of statins. The patient should be evaluated for any thyroid problems, inflammatory processes, alcohol use, excessive exercise, electrolyte disturbances, side effects of other medications or vitamin deficiencies.\n\n# Diagnosis\n\n# History and Symptoms\nThe symptoms of statin induced myopathy belong to a spectrum ranging from being mild and asymptomatic to severe and lethal. The time of onset of symptoms varies among people, but the median time of onset of symptoms is four weeks since the beginning of the treatment. Similarly, the time for the resolution of symptoms after appropriate management also varies among individuals.The history of the patient should provide a description of the characteristics of the muscle pain as well as details about medications, history of trauma, exercise or excessive alcohol use.\n\n# Laboratory Tests\nWhen a patient presents with symptoms suggestive of statin induced myopathy, the diagnostic evaluation should include measuring the level of creatine kinase. It is useful to obtain the levels of TSH, ESR and vitamin D levels as well in order to rule out other diseases that can cause myalgia.\n\n# Treatment\nWhen symptoms of myopathy or elevation of creatine kinase occur in the setting of a patient taking statins, the majority of patients may safely continue the treatment with statins. The decision on whether the patient can discontinue or continue statins depends on two factors: the severity of the symptoms and the severity of the increase in the creatine kinase level. Statins can be safely continued when the symptoms are tolerable and the creatine kinase is elevated less than 5 times the upper limits of normal. Otherwise, if the creatine kinase level is higher than five times the upper limit of normal or if the symptoms are intolerable regardless of the level of creatine kinase, statins should be stopped for a certain period of time and restarted again with lower doses or with different types of statins. The role of vitamin D and coenzyme Q10 is still controversial in the management of statin induced myopathy as no studies support their use yet.", "source": "wikidoc", "question": "According to authoritative guidelines, outline your stepwise approach to a patient taking a statin who presents with muscle symptoms, including the initial history and examination, appropriate laboratory and screening tests, how to differentiate statin‑related myopathy from other causes, the specific criteria for when to continue versus temporarily stop the statin based on symptom severity and creatine kinase levels, and your plan for reassessment, rechallenge (timing, dose adjustment or alternative statin), and the role of vitamin D or coenzyme Q10."}

Explain to people that structured education is an integral part of diabetes care. \nEnsure that any structured education programme for adults with type 2 diabetes:\nis evidence-based, and suits the needs of the person\nhas specific aims and learning objectives, and supports the person and their family members and carers to develop attitudes, beliefs, knowledge and skills to self-manage diabetes\nhas a structured curriculum that is theory driven, evidence-based and resource-effective, has supporting materials and is written down\nis delivered by trained educators who:\nhave an understanding of educational theory appropriate to the age and needs of the person\nare trained and competent to deliver the principles and content of the programme\nis quality assured, and reviewed by trained, competent, independent assessors who measure it against criteria that ensure consistency\nhas outcomes that are audited regularly. \nEnsure that education programmes for adults with type 2 diabetes provide the necessary resources to support the educators, and that educators are properly trained and given time to develop and maintain their skills. \nOffer adults with type 2 diabetes group education programmes as the preferred option. Provide an alternative of equal standard for people who are unable or prefer not to take part in group education. \nEnsure that education programmes for adults with type 2 diabetes meet the cultural, linguistic, cognitive and literacy needs of people in the local area. \nEnsure that all members of the diabetes healthcare team are familiar with the education programmes available locally for adults with type 2 diabetes, and that these programmes are integrated with the rest of the care pathway. \nEnsure that adults with type 2 diabetes and their family members and carers (as appropriate) have the opportunity to contribute to the design and provision of local education programmes for adults with type 2 diabetes. \n\n# Dietary advice and bariatric surgery\nProvide individualised and ongoing nutritional advice from a healthcare professional with specific expertise and competencies in nutrition. \nProvide dietary advice in a form sensitive to the person's needs, culture and beliefs, being sensitive to their willingness to change and the effects on their quality of life. \nEncourage adults with type 2 diabetes to follow the same healthy eating advice as the general population, which includes:\neating high-fibre, low-glycaemic-index sources of carbohydrate, such as fruit, vegetables, wholegrains and pulses\nchoosing low-fat dairy products\neating oily fish\ncontrolling their intake of saturated and trans fatty acids. \nIntegrate dietary advice with a personalised diabetes management plan, including other aspects of lifestyle modification such as increasing physical activity and losing weight. \nFor adults with type 2 diabetes who are overweight, discuss and agree an initial body weight loss target of 5% to 10%. Remember that a small amount of weight loss may still be beneficial, and a larger amount will have advantageous metabolic impact in the long term. \nIndividualise recommendations for carbohydrate and alcohol intake, and meal patterns. Make reducing the risk of hypoglycaemia a particular aim for people using insulin or an insulin secretagogue. \nAdvise adults with type 2 diabetes that they can substitute a limited amount of sucrose-containing foods for other carbohydrate in the meal plan but should take care to avoid excess energy intake. \nDiscourage adults with type 2 diabetes from using foods marketed specifically for people with diabetes. \nWhen adults with type 2 diabetes are admitted as inpatients to hospital or any other care setting, implement a meal planning system that provides consistency in the carbohydrate content of meals and snacks. \nFor recommendations on lifestyle advice, see the NICE guidelines on preventing excess weight gain, weight management, obesity, physical activity and tobacco. \nFor recommendations on bariatric surgery for people with recent-onset type 2 diabetes, see the section on bariatric surgery for people with recent-onset type 2 diabetes in the NICE guideline on obesity. \n\n# Diagnosing and managing hypertension\nThe recommendations on diagnosing and managing hypertension have been removed. For recommendations on hypertension in people with type 2 diabetes, see the NICE guideline on hypertension in adults. Diagnosis, treatment and monitoring of hypertension is broadly the same for people with type 2 diabetes as for other people. When a different approach is needed for people with type 2 diabetes, this is specified in the hypertension guideline.\n\n# Antiplatelet therapy\nDo not offer antiplatelet therapy (aspirin or clopidogrel) to adults with type 2 diabetes without cardiovascular disease. \nFor guidance on the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease in adults with type 2 diabetes, see the NICE guidelines on cardiovascular disease and acute coronary syndromes. \n\n# Blood glucose management\n\n## HbA1c measurement and targets\nMeasure HbA1c levels in adults with type 2 diabetes every:\nto 6 months (tailored to individual needs) until HbA1c is stable on unchanging therapy\nmonths once the HbA1c level and blood glucose lowering therapy are stable. \nMeasure HbA1c using methods calibrated according to International Federation of Clinical Chemistry (IFCC) standardisation. \nIf HbA1c monitoring is invalid because of disturbed erythrocyte turnover or abnormal haemoglobin type, estimate trends in blood glucose control using one of the following:\nquality-controlled plasma glucose profiles\ntotal glycated haemoglobin estimation (if abnormal haemoglobins)\nfructosamine estimation. \nInvestigate unexplained discrepancies between HbA1c and other glucose measurements. Seek advice from a team with specialist expertise in diabetes or clinical biochemistry. \nNICE has produced a patient decision aid on agreeing HbA1c targets, which also covers factors to weigh up when discussing HbA1c targets with patients.\nDiscuss and agree an individual HbA1c target with adults with type 2 diabetes (see recommendations 1.6.6 to 1.6.10). Encourage them to reach their target and maintain it, unless any resulting adverse effects (including hypoglycaemia), or their efforts to achieve their target impair their quality of life. Think about using the NICE patient decision aid on weighing up HbA1c targets to support these discussions. \nOffer lifestyle advice and drug treatment to support adults with type 2 diabetes to reach and maintain their HbA1c target (see the sections on dietary advice and bariatric surgery and choosing drug treatments). For more information about supporting adherence, see the NICE guideline on medicines adherence. \nFor adults whose type 2 diabetes is managed either by lifestyle and diet, or lifestyle and diet combined with a single drug not associated with hypoglycaemia, support them to aim for an HbA1c level of 48 mmol/mol (6.5%). For adults on a drug associated with hypoglycaemia, support them to aim for an HbA1c level of 53 mmol/mol (7.0%). \nIn adults with type 2 diabetes, if HbA1c levels are not adequately controlled by a single drug and rise to 58 mmol/mol (7.5%) or higher:\nreinforce advice about diet, lifestyle and adherence to drug treatment and\nsupport the person to aim for an HbA1c level of 53 mmol/mol (7.0%) and\nintensify drug treatment. \nConsider relaxing the target HbA1c level (see recommendations 1.6.7 and 1.6.8 and NICE's patient decision aid) on a case-by-case basis and in discussion with adults with type 2 diabetes, with particular consideration for people who are older or frailer, if:\nthey are unlikely to achieve longer-term risk-reduction benefits, for example, people with a reduced life expectancy\ntight blood glucose control would put them at high risk if they developed hypoglycaemia, for example, if they are at risk of falling, they have impaired awareness of hypoglycaemia, or they drive or operate machinery as part of their job\nintensive management would not be appropriate, for example if they have significant comorbidities. \nIf adults with type 2 diabetes reach an HbA1c level that is lower than their target and they are not experiencing hypoglycaemia, encourage them to maintain it. Be aware that there are other possible reasons for a low HbA1c level, for example deteriorating renal function or sudden weight loss. \nFor guidance on HbA1c targets for women with type 2 diabetes who are pregnant or planning to become pregnant, see the NICE guideline on diabetes in pregnancy. \n\n## Self-monitoring of capillary blood glucose\nThese recommendations relate to self-monitoring by capillary blood glucose monitoring.\nTake the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA)'s Assessing fitness to drive: a guide for medical professionals into account when offering self‑monitoring of capillary blood glucose levels for adults with type 2 diabetes. \nDo not routinely offer self-monitoring of capillary blood glucose levels for adults with type 2 diabetes unless:\nthe person is on insulin or\nthere is evidence of hypoglycaemic episodes or\nthe person is on oral medication that may increase their risk of hypoglycaemia while driving or operating machinery or\nthe person is pregnant or is planning to become pregnant (see the NICE guideline on diabetes in pregnancy). \nConsider short-term self-monitoring of capillary blood glucose levels in adults with type 2 diabetes, reviewing treatment as necessary:\nwhen starting treatment with oral or intravenous corticosteroids or\nto confirm suspected hypoglycaemia. \nBe aware that adults with type 2 diabetes who have acute intercurrent illness are at risk of worsening hyperglycaemia. Review treatment as necessary. \nIf adults with type 2 diabetes are self-monitoring their capillary blood glucose levels, carry out a structured assessment at least annually. The assessment should include:\nthe person's self-monitoring skills\nthe quality and frequency of testing\nchecking that the person knows how to interpret the blood glucose results and what action to take\nthe impact on the person's quality of life\nthe continued benefit to the person\nthe equipment used. \n\n## Continuous glucose monitoring\nOffer intermittently scanned continuous glucose monitoring (isCGM, commonly referred to as 'flash') to adults with type 2 diabetes on multiple daily insulin injections if any of the following apply:\nthey have recurrent hypoglycaemia or severe hypoglycaemia\nthey have impaired hypoglycaemia awareness\nthey have a condition or disability (including a learning disability or cognitive impairment) that means they cannot self-monitor their blood glucose by capillary blood glucose monitoring but could use an isCGM device (or have it scanned for them)\nthey would otherwise be advised to self-measure at least 8 times a day. For guidance on continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) for pregnant women, see the NICE guideline on diabetes in pregnancy. \nOffer isCGM to adults with insulin-treated type 2 diabetes who would otherwise need help from a care worker or healthcare professional to monitor their blood glucose. \nConsider real-time continuous glucose monitoring (rtCGM) as an alternative to isCGM for adults with insulin-treated type 2 diabetes if it is available for the same or lower cost. \nCGM should be provided by a team with expertise in its use, as part of supporting people to self-manage their diabetes. \nAdvise adults with type 2 diabetes who are using CGM that they will still need to take capillary blood glucose measurements (although they can do this less often). Explain that is because:\nthey will need to use capillary blood glucose measurements to check the accuracy of their CGM device\nthey will need capillary blood glucose monitoring as a back-up (for example when their blood glucose levels are changing quickly or if the device stops working). Provide them with enough test strips to take capillary blood glucose measurements as needed. \nIf a person is offered rtCGM or isCGM but cannot or does not want to use any of these devices, offer capillary blood glucose monitoring. \nEnsure CGM is part of the education provided to adults with type 2 diabetes who are using it (see the section on education). \nMonitor and review the person's use of CGM as part of reviewing their diabetes care plan (see the section on individualised care). \nIf there are concerns about the way a person is using the CGM device:\nask if they are having problems using their device\nlook at ways to address any problems and concerns to improve their use of the device, including further education and emotional and psychological support. \nCommissioners, providers and healthcare professionals should address inequalities in CGM access and uptake by:\nmonitoring who is using CGM\nidentifying groups who are eligible but who have a lower uptake\nmaking plans to engage with these groups to encourage them to consider CGM. \nFor a short explanation of why the committee made these recommendations see the rationale and impact section on continuous glucose monitoring .\nFull details of the evidence and the committee's discussion are in evidence review C: continuous glucose monitoring in adults with type 2 diabetes.\nLoading. Please wait.\n\n# Drug treatment\nRecommendations in this section that cover dipeptidyl peptidase‑4 (DPP‑4) inhibitors, glucagon‑like peptide‑1 (GLP‑1) mimetics, sulfonylureas and sodium–glucose cotransporter‑2 (SGLT2) inhibitors refer to each of these groups of drugs at class level unless otherwise stated.\nNICE technology appraisals for SGLT2 inhibitors recommend the use of these medicines only in specific populations and in certain circumstances. The 2022 update of this guideline looked at the clinical- and cost-effectiveness evidence for SGLT2 inhibitors in people with cardiovascular disease or at high risk of developing cardiovascular disease. The guideline recommends SGLT2 inhibitors in a wider population than the technology appraisals that were published before February 2022.\n\n## Choosing drug treatments\nWe have produced a visual summary to provide an overview of the recommendations and additional information to support medicines choice.\nDiscuss with adults with type 2 diabetes the benefits and risks of drug treatment and the options available. Base the choice of drug treatments on:\nthe person's individual clinical circumstances, for example comorbidities, contraindications, weight, and risks from polypharmacy\nthe person's individual preferences and needs\nthe effectiveness of the drug treatments in terms of metabolic response and cardiovascular and renal protection\nsafety and tolerability of the drug treatment\nmonitoring requirements\nthe licensed indications or combinations available\ncost (if 2 drugs in the same class are appropriate, choose the option with the lowest acquisition cost). See the NICE guideline on shared decision making and the section on safety of medicines for diabetes before and during pregnancy in the NICE guideline on diabetes in pregnancy.\n\n## Rescue therapy at any phase of treatment\nIf an adult with type 2 diabetes is symptomatically hyperglycaemic, consider insulin (see the section on insulin-based treatments) or a sulfonylurea, and review treatment when blood glucose control has been achieved. \n\n## First-line drug treatment\nAlso see the visual summary on first-line drug treatment for an overview of the recommendations and additional information to support medicines choice.\nFor adults with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease, follow recommendations on SGLT2 inhibitors in the section on chronic kidney disease in this guideline.\nOffer standard-release metformin as first-line drug treatment to adults with type 2 diabetes. \nAssess the person's cardiovascular status and risk to determine whether they have chronic heart failure or established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease or are at high risk of developing cardiovascular disease.See the recommendations on using risk scores and QRISK2 to assess cardiovascular disease risk in adults with type 2 diabetes in NICE's guideline on cardiovascular disease: risk assessment and reduction, including lipid modification. \nBased on the cardiovascular risk assessment for the person with type 2 diabetes:\nIf they have chronic heart failure or established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, offer an SGLT2 inhibitor with proven cardiovascular benefit in addition to metformin.\nIf they are at high risk of developing cardiovascular disease, consider an SGLT2 inhibitor with proven cardiovascular benefit in addition to metformin. \nSee the rationale and impact section on first-line drug treatment  for an explanation of 'proven cardiovascular benefit'\nLoading. Please wait.\nWhen starting an adult with type 2 diabetes on dual therapy with metformin and an SGLT2 inhibitor as first-line therapy, introduce the drugs sequentially, starting with metformin and checking tolerability. Start the SGLT2 inhibitor as soon as metformin tolerability is confirmed. \nGradually increase the dose of standard-release metformin over several weeks to minimise the risk of gastrointestinal side effects in adults with type 2 diabetes. \nIf an adult with type 2 diabetes experiences gastrointestinal side effects with standard‑release metformin, consider a trial of modified‑release metformin. \nFor first-line drug treatment in adults with type 2 diabetes, if metformin is contraindicated or not tolerated:\nIf they have chronic heart failure or established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, offer an SGLT2 inhibitor with proven cardiovascular benefit.\nIf they are at high risk of developing cardiovascular disease, consider an SGLT2 inhibitor with proven cardiovascular benefit. \nFor first-line drug treatment in adults with type 2 diabetes, if metformin is contraindicated or not tolerated and if they are not in either of the groups in recommendation 1.7.9, consider:\na DPP‑4 inhibitor or\npioglitazone or\na sulfonylurea or\nan SGLT2 inhibitor for people who meet the criteria in NICE's technology appraisal guidance on canagliflozin, dapagliflozin and empagliflozin as monotherapies or ertugliflozin as monotherapy or with metformin for treating type 2 diabetes. \nBefore starting an SGLT2 inhibitor, check whether the person may be at increased risk of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), for example if:\nthey have had a previous episode of DKA\nthey are unwell with intercurrent illness\nthey are following a very low carbohydrate or ketogenic diet. \nAddress modifiable risks for DKA before starting an SGLT2 inhibitor. For example, for people who are following a very low carbohydrate or ketogenic diet, they may need to delay treatment until they have changed their diet. \nAdvise adults with type 2 diabetes who are taking an SGLT2 inhibitor about the need to minimise their risk of DKA by not starting a very low carbohydrate or ketogenic diet without discussing it with their healthcare professional, because they may need to suspend SGLT2 inhibitor treatment. \nFor a short explanation of why the committee made these recommendations and how they might affect practice, see the rationale and impact section on first-line drug treatment .\nFull details of the evidence and the committee's decision are in evidence review B: pharmacological therapies with cardiovascular and other benefits in people with type 2 diabetes.\nLoading. Please wait.\n\n## Reviewing drug treatments\nWhen reviewing or considering changing treatments for adults with type 2 diabetes, think about and discuss the following with the person:\nhow to optimise their current treatment regimen before thinking about changing treatments, taking into account factors such as:\nadverse effects\nadherence to existing medicines\nthe need to revisit advice about diet and lifestyle\nprescribed doses and formulations\nstopping medicines that have had no impact on glycaemic control or weight, unless there is an additional clinical benefit, such as cardiovascular or renal protection, from continued treatment (see the note below on off-label use)\nwhether switching rather than adding drugs could be effective\nthe considerations about treatment choice in recommendation 1.7.1. In February 2022, using ertugliflozin to reduce cardiovascular risk when blood glucose is well controlled was off-label. See NICE's information on prescribing medicines.Also see the recommendations on medication review in the NICE guideline on medicines optimisation and on reviewing medicines and supporting adherence in the NICE guideline on medicines adherence.\nFor adults with type 2 diabetes who start taking an SGLT2 inhibitor before they are 40 because they have an elevated lifetime risk of cardiovascular disease, do not stop the SGLT2 inhibitor when they turn 40 even if their QRISK2 score is below 10%. Only stop the SGLT2 inhibitor if the person's circumstances have changed and the SGLT2 inhibitor is no longer appropriate. \nFor adults with type 2 diabetes at any stage after they have started first-line treatment:\nIf they have or develop chronic heart failure or established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, offer an SGLT2 inhibitor with proven cardiovascular benefit in addition to current treatment or replace an existing drug with the SGLT2 inhibitor.\nIf they are or become at high risk of developing cardiovascular disease, consider adding an SGLT2 inhibitor with proven cardiovascular benefit to current treatment or replacing an existing drug with the SGLT2 inhibitor.Take into account the person's current treatment regimen and preferences and make a shared decision about switching treatments or adding an SGLT2 inhibitor, as appropriate (also see recommendations 1.7.12 and 1.7.13 on starting an SGLT2 inhibitor). In February 2022, using ertugliflozin to reduce cardiovascular risk when blood glucose is well controlled was off-label. See NICE's information on prescribing medicines.\nFor a short explanation of why the committee made these recommendations and how they might affect practice, see the rationale and impact section on reviewing drug treatments .\nFull details of the evidence and the committee's discussion are in evidence review B: pharmacological therapies with cardiovascular and other benefits in people with type 2 diabetes.\nLoading. Please wait.\n\n## Treatment options if further interventions are needed\nAlso see our visual summary on treatment options if further interventions are needed for an overview of the recommendations and additional information to support medicines choice.\nIntroduce drugs used in combination therapy in a stepwise manner, checking for tolerability and effectiveness of each drug. \nFor adults with type 2 diabetes, if monotherapy has not continued to control HbA1c to below the person's individually agreed threshold for further intervention, consider adding:\na DPP‑4 inhibitor or\npioglitazone or\na sulfonylurea or\nan SGLT2 inhibitor for people who meet the criteria in NICE's technology appraisal guidance on canagliflozin in combination therapy, ertugliflozin as monotherapy or with metformin, or dapagliflozin or empagliflozin in combination therapy. \nFor adults with type 2 diabetes, if dual therapy with metformin and another oral drug has not continued to control HbA1c to below the person's individually agreed threshold for further intervention consider either:\ntriple therapy by adding a DPP‑4 inhibitor, pioglitazone or a sulfonylurea or an SGLT2 inhibitor for people who meet the criteria in NICE's technology appraisal guidance on canagliflozin in combination therapy, dapagliflozin in triple therapy, empagliflozin in combination therapy, or ertugliflozin with metformin and a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor or\nstarting insulin-based treatment (see the section on insulin-based treatments). \nIn adults with type 2 diabetes, if metformin is contraindicated or not tolerated and dual therapy with 2 oral drugs has not continued to control HbA1c to below the person's individually agreed threshold for intervention, consider insulin-based treatment (see the section on insulin-based treatments). \nIf triple therapy with metformin and 2 other oral drugs is not effective, not tolerated or contraindicated, consider triple therapy by switching one drug for a GLP‑1 mimetic for adults with type 2 diabetes who:\nhave a body mass index (BMI) of 35 kg/m2 or higher (adjust accordingly for people from Black, Asian and other minority ethnic groups) and specific psychological or other medical problems associated with obesity or\nhave a BMI lower than 35 kg/m2 and:\nfor whom insulin therapy would have significant occupational implications or\nweight loss would benefit other significant obesity-related comorbidities. \nOnly continue GLP‑1 mimetic therapy if the adult with type 2 diabetes has had a beneficial metabolic response (a reduction of at least 11 mmol/mol  in HbA1c and weight loss of at least 3% of initial body weight in 6 months). \nFor adults with type 2 diabetes, only offer combination therapy with a GLP‑1 mimetic and insulin along with specialist care advice and ongoing support from a consultant-led multidisciplinary team. \nFor a short explanation of why the committee did not make any new 2022 recommendations, see the rationale and impact section on treatment options if further interventions are needed .\nFull details of the evidence and the committee's discussion are in evidence review B: pharmacological therapies with cardiovascular and other benefits in people with type 2 diabetes.\nLoading. Please wait.\n\n## Insulin-based treatments\nFor adults with type 2 diabetes starting insulin therapy, provide a structured programme using active insulin dose titration that encompasses:\ninjection technique, including rotating injection sites and avoiding repeated injections at the same point within sites\ncontinuing telephone support\nself-monitoring\ndose titration to target levels\ndietary advice\nthe DVLA's Assessing fitness to drive: a guide for medical professionals\nmanaging hypoglycaemia\nmanaging acute changes in plasma glucose control\nsupport from an appropriately trained and experienced healthcare professional. \nFor adults with type 2 diabetes starting insulin therapy, continue to offer metformin for people without contraindications or intolerance. Review the continued need for other blood glucose lowering therapies. \nStart insulin therapy for adults with type 2 diabetes from a choice of the following insulin types and regimens:\nOffer neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH) insulin injected once or twice daily according to need.\nConsider starting both NPH and short‑acting insulin (particularly if the person's HbA1c is 75 mmol/mol  or higher), administered either:\nseparately or\nas a pre-mixed (biphasic) human insulin preparation.\nConsider, as an alternative to NPH insulin, using insulin detemir or insulin glargine if:\nthe person needs help from a carer or healthcare professional to inject insulin, and use of insulin detemir or insulin glargine would reduce the frequency of injections from twice to once daily or\nthe person's lifestyle is restricted by recurrent symptomatic hypoglycaemic episodes or\nthe person would otherwise need twice‑daily NPH insulin injections in combination with oral glucose‑lowering drugs.\nConsider pre-mixed (biphasic) preparations that include short‑acting insulin analogues, rather than pre‑mixed (biphasic) preparations that include short‑acting human insulin preparations, if:\nthe person prefers injecting insulin immediately before a meal or\nhypoglycaemia is a problem or\nblood glucose levels rise markedly after meals. \nConsider switching to insulin detemir or insulin glargine from NPH insulin in adults with type 2 diabetes:\nwho do not reach their target HbA1c because of significant hypoglycaemia or\nwho experience significant hypoglycaemia on NPH insulin irrespective of the level of HbA1c reached or\nwho cannot use the device needed to inject NPH insulin but could administer their own insulin safely and accurately if a switch to one of the long‑acting insulin analogues was made or\nwho need help from a carer or healthcare professional to administer insulin injections and for whom switching to one of the long‑acting insulin analogues would reduce the number of daily injections. \nMonitor adults with type 2 diabetes who are on a basal insulin regimen (NPH insulin, insulin detemir or insulin glargine) for the need for short‑acting insulin before meals (or a pre‑mixed  insulin preparation). \nMonitor adults with type 2 diabetes who are on pre‑mixed (biphasic) insulin for the need for a further injection of short‑acting insulin before meals or for a change to a basal-bolus regimen with NPH insulin or insulin detemir or insulin glargine, if blood glucose control remains inadequate. \nWhen starting an insulin for which a biosimilar is available, use the product with the lowest acquisition cost. \nEnsure the risk of medication errors with insulins is minimised by following the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) guidance on minimising the risk of medication error with high strength, fixed combination and biosimilar insulin products, which includes advice for healthcare professionals when starting treatment with a biosimilar. \nWhen people are already using an insulin for which a lower cost biosimilar is available, discuss the possibility of switching to the biosimilar. Make a shared decision with the person after discussing their preferences. \nFor a short explanation of why the committee made the 2021 recommendations on biosimilars and how they might affect practice, see the rationale and impact section on long-acting insulin .\nLoading. Please wait.\nFor guidance on using insulin in combination with SGLT2 inhibitors, see:\nthe section on drug treatment\nNICE's technology appraisal guidance on canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, and empagliflozin in combination therapy.\n\n## Insulin delivery\nFor guidance on insulin delivery for adults with type 2 diabetes, see the section on insulin delivery in the NICE guideline on type 1 diabetes. \n\n# Managing complications\n\n## Periodontitis\nAdvise adults with type 2 diabetes at their annual review that:\nthey are at higher risk of periodontitis\nif they get periodontitis, managing it can improve their blood glucose control and can reduce their risk of hyperglycaemia. \nAdvise adults with type 2 diabetes to have regular oral health reviews (their oral healthcare or dental team will tell them how often, in line with the NICE guideline on dental checks: intervals between oral health reviews). \nFor guidance for oral healthcare and dental teams on how to provide oral health advice, see the NICE guideline on oral health promotion. \nFor adults with type 2 diabetes who have been diagnosed with periodontitis by an oral healthcare or dental team, offer dental appointments to manage and treat their periodontitis (at a frequency based on their oral health needs). \nFor a short explanation of why the committee made these recommendations, see the rationale and impact section on periodontitis .\nFull details of the evidence and the committee's discussion are in evidence review D: periodontitis.\nLoading. Please wait.\n\n## Gastroparesis\nThink about a diagnosis of gastroparesis in adults with type 2 diabetes who have erratic blood glucose control or unexplained gastric bloating or vomiting, taking into account possible alternative diagnoses. \nFor adults with type 2 diabetes who have vomiting caused by gastroparesis, explain that:\nthere is no strong evidence that any available antiemetic therapy is effective\nsome people have had benefit with domperidone, erythromycin or metoclopramide\nthe strongest evidence for effectiveness is for domperidone, but prescribers must take into account its safety profile, in particular its cardiac risk and potential interactions with other medicines. In December 2015, the use of erythromycin was off-label. See NICE's information on prescribing medicines.\nTo treat vomiting caused by gastroparesis in adults with type 2 diabetes:\nconsider alternating the use of erythromycin and metoclopramide\nconsider domperidone only in exceptional circumstances (if domperidone is the only effective treatment) and in accordance with MHRA guidance on domperidone. In December 2015, the use of erythromycin was off-label. See NICE's information on prescribing medicines.\nIf gastroparesis is suspected, consider referring adults with type 2 diabetes to specialist services if:\nthe differential diagnosis is in doubt or\nthe person has persistent or severe vomiting. \n\n## Painful diabetic neuropathy\nFor guidance on managing painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy in adults with type 2 diabetes, see the NICE guideline on neuropathic pain in adults. \n\n## Autonomic neuropathy\nThink about the possibility of contributory sympathetic nervous system damage in adults with type 2 diabetes who lose the warning signs of hypoglycaemia. \nThink about the possibility of autonomic neuropathy affecting the gut in adults with type 2 diabetes who have unexplained diarrhoea that happens particularly at night. \nFor adults with type 2 diabetes and autonomic neuropathy who are taking tricyclic drugs and antihypertensive drug treatments, be aware of the increased likelihood of side effects such as orthostatic hypotension. For guidance on safe prescribing of antidepressants (such as tricyclic drugs) and managing withdrawal, see NICE's guideline on medicines associated with dependence or withdrawal symptoms. \nFor adults with type 2 diabetes who have unexplained bladder‑emptying problems, investigate the possibility of autonomic neuropathy affecting the bladder. \nIn managing autonomic neuropathy symptoms, include specific interventions indicated by the manifestations (for example, for abnormal sweating or nocturnal diarrhoea). \n\n## Diabetic foot problems\nFor guidance on preventing and managing foot problems in adults with type 2 diabetes, see the NICE guideline on diabetic foot problems. \n\n## Chronic kidney disease\nFor adults with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and type 2 diabetes, offer an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) or an angiotensin‑converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (titrated to the highest licensed dose that the person can tolerate) if albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) is 3 mg/mmol or more, as recommended in the section on pharmacotherapy for CKD in adults, children, and young people with related persistent proteinuria in the NICE guideline on chronic kidney disease. \nFor adults with type 2 diabetes and CKD who are taking an ARB or an ACE inhibitor (titrated to the highest licensed dose that they can tolerate), offer an SGLT2 inhibitor (in addition to the ARB or ACE inhibitor) if:\nACR is over 30 mg/mmol and\nthey meet the criteria in the marketing authorisation (including relevant estimated glomerular filtration rate  thresholds).In November 2021, not all SGLT2 inhibitors were licensed for this indication. See NICE's information on prescribing medicines. \nFor adults with type 2 diabetes and CKD who are taking an ARB or an ACE inhibitor (titrated to the highest licensed dose that they can tolerate), consider an SGLT2 inhibitor (in addition to the ARB or ACE inhibitor) if:\nACR is between 3 and 30 mg/mmol and\nthey meet the criteria in the marketing authorisation (including relevant eGFR thresholds). In November 2021, not all SGLT2 inhibitors were licensed for this indication. See NICE's information on prescribing medicines. \nFor guidance on dapagliflozin for adults with CKD, see NICE's technology appraisal guidance on dapagliflozin for treating chronic kidney disease. \nFor further guidance on managing kidney disease in adults with type 2 diabetes, see the NICE guideline on chronic kidney disease. \nFor a short explanation of why the committee made these recommendations and how they might affect practice, see the rationale and impact section on SGLT2 inhibitors for adults with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease .\nFull details of the evidence and the committee's discussion are in evidence review A: SGLT2 inhibitors for people with chronic kidney disease and type 2 diabetes.\nLoading.

The current practice of 'stopping rules' is typically motivated by either inadequate blood glucose control (rising HbA1c levels) or intolerable side effects. There is limited understanding of the short- and long‑term effects of stopping a therapy and switching to another in terms of diabetes control (HbA1c levels), hypoglycaemic risk, weight gain, and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. In addition, there is limited understanding of how quickly consideration should be given to stopping and switching to another drug treatment and, if stopping and switching may be needed, what the optimal sequencing is of drug treatments. Randomised controlled trials examining these different issues would help to improve diabetes care.\n\n## Non-metformin-based drug treatment combinations to control blood glucose levels\nIn adults with type 2 diabetes, what treatment combinations (for example, glucagon‑like peptide‑1  mimetics and insulin combination therapy with meglitinides) are most effective when initial drug treatment with non‑metformin monotherapy fails to adequately control blood glucose levels? \nAlthough it is recognised that metformin therapy is suitable for most adults with type 2 diabetes, its use is contraindicated or not tolerated in approximately 15% of individuals. To date, research evidence has largely focused on metformin‑based treatment combinations. Given the progressive nature of the condition, in which intensification of blood glucose lowering drug therapies are indicated over time, there is little evidence, for some adults, to guide management strategies on treatment combinations that do not include metformin. Randomised controlled trials are therefore needed to better understand the treatment choices that are available which improve blood glucose control and long‑term risks of complications associated with diabetes.\n\n## Drug treatment for when blood glucose levels are inadequately controlled by 3 oral antidiabetic drugs or insulin combinations\nWhen blood glucose levels are inadequately controlled by 3 oral antidiabetic drugs and/or insulin combinations, which blood glucose lowering therapies should be used to control blood glucose levels? \nAs the incidence of type 2 diabetes increases in the younger population and as blood glucose control declines naturally over time, it is likely that further intensification of therapies would be needed. Currently, there is evidence up to second intensification of drug therapies, that is, when 2 or more non‑insulin‑based treatment combinations fail to adequately control blood glucose levels. Randomised controlled trials are needed to improve understanding of alternative treatment options for adults at second intensification whose blood glucose is inadequately controlled with insulin and/or triple non‑insulin‑based drug therapies.\n\n## Self-monitoring of blood glucose levels\nWhat is the optimal frequency for self‑monitoring of blood glucose in adults with type 2 diabetes? \nThere is limited evidence in relation to the long‑term effects (at least 5 years) of blood glucose lowering therapies, particularly newer agents in terms of efficacy and adverse events (for example, cardiovascular outcomes). Randomised controlled trials and prospective longitudinal studies are needed to better understand the long‑term efficacy and safety issues surrounding these medicines.\n\n# Other recommendations for research\n\n## Effectiveness of SGLT2 inhibitors for different ethnic groups\nWhat is the clinical and cost effectiveness of SGLT2 inhibitors in adults with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease, stratified across different ethnic groups? \nFor a short explanation of why the committee made the recommendation for research, see the rationale on SGLT2 inhibitors for adults with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease .\nFull details of the evidence and the committee's discussion are in evidence review A: SGLT2 inhibitors for people with chronic kidney disease and type 2 diabetes.\nLoading.

Please wait.# Rationale and impact\nThese sections briefly explain why the committee made the recommendations and how they might affect practice.\n\n# Continuous glucose monitoring\nRecommendations 1.6.17 to 1.6.26\n\n## Why the committee made the recommendations\nThe committee discussed how continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) could potentially be useful for many people with type 2 diabetes. They were aware of examples from current practice in which adults who have insulin-treated type 2 diabetes and use intermittently scanned CGM (isCGM) have had good outcomes. Because of the additional cost associated with CGM and the large number of adults with type 2 diabetes, the committee used both the evidence and their clinical experience to decide who would gain the most benefit from using CGM.\nThere was evidence that intermittently scanned CGM (isCGM) was cost effective for adults with type 2 diabetes using insulin, but no evidence for populations not using insulin, so the committee agreed to restrict their recommendations to that subpopulation.\nPeople who have recurrent or severe hypoglycaemic events were identified as one of the groups likely to benefit most from isCGM, because hypoglycaemic events were considered to be one of the most important and concerning outcomes for adults with type 2 diabetes who are using insulin. The committee decided that the number of hypoglycaemic events was a more effective indicator of someone who would benefit from isCGM than specific HbA1c target values, because target values can vary between people. The evidence also indicated minimal effects of isCGM on HbA1c values.\nThe committee agreed that people with impaired hypoglycaemic awareness would also benefit from isCGM. However, they did not recommend specific methods for assessing impaired hypoglycaemic awareness. This is because validated methods for assessing impaired hypoglycaemic awareness in people with type 2 diabetes (such as the GOLD or Clarke scores) are not always available in primary care.\nPeople who use insulin and have a condition or disability that restricts their ability to self-monitor blood glucose levels should also be offered isCGM. This is because having access to isGCM means they will no longer have to rely on others to monitor their diabetes, potentially increasing their independence. For people with learning disabilities, this recommendation is in line with similar guidance for type 1 diabetes set out in the NHS RightCare Pathway, which specifies reasonable adjustments for people with a learning disability who have diabetes.\nPeople who are advised to self-measure using capillary blood glucose monitoring more than 8 times a day should also be offered isCGM. This is in line with the funding requirements for NHS England's flash glucose monitoring: national arrangements for funding of relevant diabetes patients. Although the funding requirements are specifically for people with type 1 diabetes, the committee thought that this criterion was also important for people with type 2 diabetes who have to monitor their blood glucose levels multiple times a day.\nPeople who need help from a care worker or other healthcare professional to administer their insulin injections should also be offered isCGM, even if they only use once-daily insulin injections. isCGM will help care workers to record a person's blood glucose levels quickly. And for people who have multiple home care visits per day, blood glucose levels can be recorded at each visit. This will help them to adjust their insulin levels to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemic events between home visits. It may also reduce the number of hospital admissions for this group.\nThe committee discussed how short-term use of isCGM may still be useful for some people. It may help people to understand when they have hypoglycaemic episodes, which would help them to develop a more effective treatment plan.\nThere was no evidence that real-time CGM (rtCGM) was cost effective for people with type 2 diabetes, so the committee agreed it could not be recommended for all adults with type 2 diabetes (whether or not they used insulin). They noted, however, that prices of rtCGM have reduced over the past few years, and if this continues to happen there may come a time when it is no more expensive than isCGM. At this point, rtCGM would be an appropriate alternative for people who meet the criteria for isCGM.\nThe committee did not make a recommendation on using specific devices because CGM technologies are changing very quickly and this recommendation would soon be out of date. Local healthcare services are better placed to assess which devices are evidence-based and suitable for use at any given time.\nThe committee discussed how self-monitoring of blood glucose should still take place, albeit less frequently, even when a person is using CGM. The ability to self-monitor blood glucose levels allows people to ensure the accuracy of the CGM device. The committee also recommended keeping capillary blood glucose monitoring as a back-up for situations such as when the technology fails.\nThe committee decided to highlight that CGM should be provided by a team who have expertise in its use. To ensure that CGM is effective, healthcare professionals need to have the skills to interpret and communicate the data effectively. As well as healthcare professionals having a clear understanding of CGM, it is also crucial that people with type 2 diabetes who are using CGM have education about the technology. This will increase the likelihood that people will scan and report the results frequently, allowing people to understand and manage their diabetes effectively.\nAlthough many people will choose CGM if offered, there are some people who either cannot be offered it or do not want to use it. Because it is still important for these people to monitor their blood glucose levels, the committee made a recommendation to reinforce the importance of offering capillary blood glucose monitoring instead.\nThe committee did not make a recommendation on how long CGM should be used because there was no evidence on this, and they did not want to stop people accessing CGM for short periods if they and their healthcare professional thought they could benefit from this. Using CGM for a short period of time may help some people to understand when they have hypoglycaemic episodes, thereby helping them to develop a more effective treatment plan.\nDespite the positive recommendations on CGM, the committee were concerned that existing health inequalities may still lead to lower uptake of CGM in some groups of people. To address this, the committee made a recommendation outlining actions for commissioners, providers and healthcare professionals.\nThe committee highlighted the importance of routinely reviewing a person's use of CGM. This will establish whether it is providing clinical benefits and whether the monitor is being used correctly. Making people aware that their use of CGM will be continually reviewed is important so they know it is not a guaranteed long-term option.\nThe committee also made a recommendation for research on using routinely collected real-world data to assess the effectiveness and cost effectiveness of CGM. They agreed that this has the potential to show the direct effects of the technology used by people with type 2 diabetes instead of interpreting it through the results of clinical trials. Increased monitoring of routine healthcare data including registries and audits would ensure that findings from a broader population are captured.\n\n## How the recommendations might affect practice\nThe recommendations are likely to increase the number of adults with type 2 diabetes who are offered CGM, particularly those who have issues with hypoglycaemia. This will have associated cost implications:\nIt may save the NHS time, because healthcare professionals do not have to meet people who are using CGM as often as people who use capillary blood glucose monitoring.\nThere should be fewer hypoglycaemic events to manage. The committee did not expect a significant resource impact related to education and monitoring for the CGM devices.\nReturn to recommendations\n\n# First-line drug treatment\nRecommendations 1.7.3 to 1.7.13\n\n## Why the committee made the recommendations\nThe evidence from the clinical trials looking at cardiovascular benefits, the network meta-analyses, and the economic modelling, showed that some treatments were effective at improving cardiovascular outcomes and were likely to be cost effective. All of these trials recruited people with established cardiovascular disease, and some also included people with a high risk of developing cardiovascular disease. However, for people without high cardiovascular risk, the committee agreed there was more uncertainty over whether the same level of cardiovascular benefits seen in the high-risk groups could be applied to a lower risk population. They decided that they could not justify changing the recommendations for people at lower risk based on this evidence. Therefore, they retained the 2015 recommendations outlining the drug treatment options for people in the lower risk group.\nThe committee agreed it was important to assess people's cardiovascular status and risk to help determine which treatments are suitable for them. They used a definition for the established cardiovascular disease group (adults with type 2 diabetes and chronic heart failure or established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease) that reflected the people included in all the clinical trials and modelled as a subgroup in the economic model.\nTo assess whether people are at high risk of developing cardiovascular disease, the committee recommended using the QRISK2 tool because this is recommended in the NICE guideline on cardiovascular disease: risk assessment and reduction, including lipid modification for adults with type 2 diabetes, and the factors covered by this tool were similar to those used in the trials and economic model to define this population. In addition, this tool is widely used in current practice in the NHS.\nLifetime cardiovascular risk may be underestimated in people aged under 40 using this tool, so the committee also included risk factors to consider for this age group. This definition was broadly aligned to the subgroup of people with high cardiovascular risk without established cardiovascular disease who were included in the model.\nThe evidence showed that SGLT2 inhibitors as a class of drugs were most likely to be cost effective in combination with metformin, although the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) varied between different drugs in the class and in different scenarios in the model. The exception to this was dapagliflozin, which was cost effective at a threshold of £20,000 per quality-adjusted life year in the base-case analysis and across a range of model scenarios. However, the committee agreed there was too much uncertainty in the clinical data, and therefore the economic modelling, for them to be confident that these different ICERs represented true underlying differences in cost effectiveness.\nThere were also varying levels of certainty in the clinical trials and the network meta-analyses about:\nwhich individual SGLT2 inhibitors were effective at improving cardiovascular outcomes\nwhether there were real differences in cardiovascular benefits between the different SGLT2 inhibitors.For hospitalisation for heart failure, empagliflozin, canagliflozin and dapagliflozin produced a clinically meaningful reduction compared with placebo in the random effects network meta-analysis model. However, in the sensitivity analyses using a fixed effect model, ertugliflozin also showed a clinically meaningful reduction compared with placebo (which reflects the original clinical trial data). The network meta-analysis could not differentiate between the SGLT2 inhibitors.\nFor the 3‑point MACE outcome (a composite of major adverse cardiovascular events), only canagliflozin and empagliflozin produced a statistically significant reduction compared with placebo. However, the network meta-analyses again could not differentiate between SGLT2 inhibitors.\nFor all-cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality, empagliflozin showed a clinically meaningful reduction compared with placebo and the other SGLT2 inhibitors. The network meta-analysis could not differentiate between the other SGLT2 inhibitors.\nFor non-fatal myocardial infarction and non-fatal stroke, the network meta-analysis could not differentiate between empagliflozin, canagliflozin, ertugliflozin or placebo. The data for dapagliflozin was reported differently and could not be included in the network meta-analyses. In the clinical trial data, dapagliflozin could not be differentiated from placebo for myocardial infarction and was not meaningfully different from placebo for stroke.\nFinally, only dapagliflozin showed a clinically meaningful reduction in severe hypoglycaemia compared with placebo. However, the remaining SGLT2 inhibitors could not be differentiated from each other or from placebo in the network meta-analysis.\nTaking the cost effectiveness and clinical results into account, the committee decided against recommending only dapagliflozin and instead made recommendations for the SGLT2 inhibitors as a class. However, they recognised that there was greater uncertainty around the cardiovascular benefits associated with ertugliflozin than there was for empagliflozin, canagliflozin and dapagliflozin. This was because ertugliflozin did not consistently show a reduction in heart failure compared with placebo in the network meta-analyses (it depended on the model used), and it was not statistically significantly better than placebo for the 3‑point MACE outcome. The committee therefore decided to refer to 'SGLT2 inhibitors with proven cardiovascular benefit' in the recommendations. This was to enable prescribers to select a particular drug from the class of SGLT2 inhibitors that they thought was clinically appropriate for each person, while allowing the recommendation to remain current even if additional evidence or new SGLT2 inhibitors become available.\nThe committee agreed there was more certainty of cardiovascular benefits in adults with type 2 diabetes and chronic heart failure or established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease because they were participants in all the included trials, while people at high risk of developing cardiovascular disease were included in fewer trials. So, they recommended dual therapy with an SGLT2 inhibitor with proven cardiovascular benefit in addition to metformin for both groups, but only as an option to consider for people without established cardiovascular disease, to reflect the lower certainty. For people without a high risk of developing cardiovascular disease who do not have chronic heart failure or established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, metformin monotherapy remains the recommended first-line treatment option, based on the 2015 recommendation.\nWhen starting first-line dual therapy, the committee noted the importance of introducing the drugs sequentially. This enables any side effects and intolerances from the first drug to be identified before the second drug is introduced. In line with current practice, the committee recommended starting with metformin and then adding the SGLT2 inhibitor without delay once metformin tolerability is established, to avoid people remaining on metformin alone for prolonged periods.\nSome people will have established cardiovascular disease or a high risk of developing cardiovascular disease, but not be able to take an SGLT2 inhibitor. As GLP‑1 mimetics were not cost-effective options in this situation (see the rationale and impact section on why GLP-1 mimetics were not recommended as first-line treatment), the committee agreed that these people would be offered metformin alone as a first-line treatment (see recommendation 1.7.3).\nPeople who cannot tolerate metformin or for whom it is contraindicated were not included as a separate group in the economic model because the evidence was taken from trials that did not separate results by whether the person was able to take metformin or not. Most people in these trials were expected to be able to take metformin. The committee agreed with the assumption that people who cannot tolerate metformin or for whom it is contraindicated would be offered the next most effective and cost-effective treatment options after metformin.\nIn the economic model scenario, when another drug was used in place of metformin for people with established cardiovascular disease or at high risk of developing cardiovascular disease, SGLT2 inhibitors were the class of drugs that were most likely to be cost effective. The committee therefore prioritised this class of drugs for these people. As before, there was greater certainty in the results for people with established cardiovascular disease compared with those at high risk of developing cardiovascular disease, and the rationale for referring to SGLT2 inhibitors with proven cardiovascular benefit also applies here.\nSome people will have established cardiovascular disease or a high risk of developing cardiovascular disease, but not be able to take an SGLT2 inhibitor or metformin. There was no evidence specifically for this group so the committee made the same assumption as above (that these people would take the next most effective and cost-effective treatment). The committee did not recommend a specific drug for these people because GLP‑1 mimetics were not cost-effective options in this situation (see the rationale and impact section on why GLP-1 mimetics were not recommended as first-line treatment). They agreed that in practice prescribers would use their clinical judgement to choose an appropriate treatment from the remaining options, based on the individual clinical circumstances and needs of the person with type 2 diabetes (see recommendation 1.7.1).\nThe committee noted some particularly important safety considerations to take into account before an adult with type 2 diabetes starts on an SGLT2 inhibitor. The committee highlighted these because the SGLT2 inhibitors are comparatively new drugs and clinical experience with them is low in primary care, but the new recommendations are expected to greatly increase their use in this setting. In the committee's experience there have been multiple instances of avoidable diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) resulting in hospital admission. The committee highlighted some factors that might put someone at higher risk of DKA, but the list is not intended to be exhaustive. Addressing modifiable risk factors before starting an SGLT2 inhibitor could reduce the risk of DKA and make the drug safer for the person with type 2 diabetes.\nThe committee were aware that adults with type 2 diabetes who are overweight or obese may wish to try a ketogenic diet to reverse or reduce the severity of their diabetes or induce remission. However, the committee agreed, based on their experience, that there may be an increased risk of DKA associated with SGLT2 inhibitors and such diets. It is important to tell people about these risks and to advise them to discuss any planned change to a very low carbohydrate or ketogenic diet with their healthcare professional first.\nThe committee did not recommend a GLP‑1 mimetic as first-line treatment for the following reasons:\nGLP‑1 mimetics were not cost effective as a class at this (or any) stage of treatment for people with a high risk of developing cardiovascular disease or with established cardiovascular disease.\nAlthough the ICERs for injectable semaglutide for the various modelled scenarios and stages of treatment fell within a similar range to the ICERs for the individual SGLT2 inhibitors, there was more certainty that the SGLT2s were cost effective as a class. In contrast, the ICERs for injectable semaglutide increased significantly in a sensitivity analysis, highlighting the uncertainty surrounding the results.\nThere were differences in clinical effectiveness between the injectable and oral forms of semaglutide compared with placebo for some outcomes, such as all-cause mortality, based on the evidence from the trials. However, the committee agreed it was uncertain whether the observed differences in effect were real or might be related to the relatively small size and low event rates in these trials compared with other trials included in the review, which resulted in wide 95% confidence intervals around the effect estimates for some outcomes.\nThe committee concluded that the factors above combined to give such a high level of uncertainty around the clinical and cost effectiveness of injectable semaglutide that they could not make a positive recommendation for its use.\n\n## How the recommendations might affect practice\nThe recommendations to offer SGLT2 inhibitors with metformin to adults with type 2 diabetes and chronic heart failure or established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease at first-line treatment (or if they are already taking metformin monotherapy) are expected to lead to a change in practice and increase the number of people taking SGLT2 inhibitors at the beginning of their treatment. This is also expected to be the case for people with a high risk of developing cardiovascular disease, as this category is expected to cover a large proportion of adults with type 2 diabetes. In current practice, these people would not be offered combination therapy with an SGLT2 inhibitor until additional treatment is needed to control their HbA1c to below their individually agreed threshold for intervention, and then only if they met the criteria in the relevant NICE technology appraisals for being prescribed an SGLT2 inhibitor. Overall, this recommendation is expected to greatly increase the number of people taking SGLT2 inhibitors and is likely to have a substantial resource impact.\nThe number of adults with type 2 diabetes and chronic heart failure or established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease or a high risk of developing cardiovascular disease who cannot tolerate metformin, or for whom metformin is contraindicated, are expected to be relatively low. The new recommendations are likely to see a change in practice as more people start taking an SGLT2 inhibitor, and this will likely be associated with a resource impact.\nThe recommendations about how to begin combination therapy, factors to check before a person starts on an SGLT2 inhibitor, and topics to cover in a conversation with the person, are not expected to significantly increase consultation time or be a change in practice because these should already form part of the prescribing process. Checking that the person is not at increased risk of DKA when they are prescribed an SGLT2 inhibitor should help reduce the number of people who experience DKA and thereby reduce unnecessary hospital admissions.\nReturn to recommendations\n\n# Reviewing drug treatments\nRecommendations 1.7.14 to 1.7.16\n\n## Why the committee made the recommendations\nThe committee agreed that when changes to treatment are being considered it is important to review existing treatment options first. Stopping medications that have not worked, for example, in controlling blood glucose or weight loss, and optimising current treatments may remove the need to prescribe additional drugs. However, some drugs, such as SGLT2 inhibitors, may be continued because they provide additional cardiovascular protective benefits. In particular, there might be reasons, such as problems with adherence or adverse effects, that might make existing treatments less effective or ineffective. Addressing these might mean that adding a new drug is unnecessary.\nThe list of factors to think about as part of optimisation is not exhaustive but includes those that the committee thought were particularly important. The committee agreed that it is important to revisit advice about diet and lifestyle because part of this discussion is to ensure the person is supported with both non-pharmacological and pharmacological interventions to improve their current health and prognosis.\nReviews should also take into account a person's current clinical circumstances (as detailed in recommendation 1.7.1 on choosing drug treatments). This will help ensure that appropriate treatment options are considered if the person's clinical situation has changed: for example, if it has improved because of weight loss or if they have developed chronic heart failure or atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.\nWhen people with an elevated lifetime risk of cardiovascular disease turn 40, their cardiovascular risk may appear to drop when it is assessed using QRISK2. However, this is due to switching from assessing lifetime risk to a 10-year risk calculation rather than an actual decrease in cardiovascular risk. SGLT2 inhibitor treatment should not be stopped for this reason alone.\nBased on the evidence and the economic model, the benefits of SGLT2 inhibitors were not confined to first-line treatment for people with elevated cardiovascular risk or chronic heart failure or established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. To ensure that people who are already on drug therapy (including those people who have started first-line treatment, and those people who are further along the treatment pathway and are taking dual or triple therapy) for type 2 diabetes can have an SGLT2 inhibitor if their level of cardiovascular risk is sufficiently high or they have chronic heart failure or established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, the committee included a separate recommendation on SGLT2 inhibitors for these people. As explained in the rationale for recommendations on first-line treatment, the committee specified SGLT2 inhibitors with proven cardiovascular benefits.\nThis recommendation also takes into account that adults with type 2 diabetes may develop these conditions (or an increase in their risk) over time. If that happens, an SGLT2 inhibitor could then be of benefit to them. The committee agreed that it was very important to highlight that it may be more appropriate to replace an existing therapy with an SGLT2 inhibitor than to add to it, depending on the person's circumstances. This is because they were aware that treatment optimisation as detailed in recommendation 1.7.14 is not always carried out in practice.\n\n## How the recommendations might affect practice\nThe recommendation about reviewing drug treatment is not expected to be a change in practice or to need substantial additional resources because these conversations should already take place. However, the wider use of SGLT2 inhibitors in people who are already being treated for type 2 diabetes and who have or develop high cardiovascular risk or chronic heart failure or established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease is expected to lead to an increase in resource use.\nReturn to recommendations\n\n# Treatment options if further interventions are needed\nRecommendations 1.7.17 to 1.7.23\n\n## Why the committee did not make any new recommendations in 2022\nThe committee did not make any new recommendations on further treatment options. They agreed that for later stages of treatment, separate recommendations were not needed for people at high risk of developing cardiovascular disease or with chronic heart failure or established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. This was for several reasons.\nFirstly, the evidence and the economic model continued to show that an SGLT2 inhibitor was likely to be the most cost-effective option for these people. Secondly, the recommendations they had made on first-line treatment using an SGLT2 inhibitor (either with metformin, or alone if metformin is contraindicated or not tolerated) and for switching or adding this drug at later stages meant that these people would be able to access an SGLT2 inhibitor without adding this consideration to the existing 2015 recommendations.\nFinally, the alternative treatment options for people with and without increased cardiovascular risk remained the same for later treatment stages. Therefore, the committee agreed to retain the existing 2015 recommendations for treatment options if further interventions are needed, without making any changes based on cardiovascular risk.\nTo simplify treatment options, the committee merged recommendations for people in whom metformin is contraindicated or not tolerated into the existing 2015 recommendations where possible, and added the NICE technology appraisals as bullet points to the relevant existing recommendations.\nThe evidence reviewed in this update was limited to the cardiovascular benefits of GLP‑1 mimetics and the committee agreed that this was only generalisable to people with a high risk of developing cardiovascular disease or with chronic heart failure or established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. As for first-line treatment, GLP-1 mimetics as a class were not cost-effective options for later stages of treatment, and there was too much uncertainty in the clinical and cost effectiveness to support recommending injectable semaglutide (see the rationale and impact section on first-line drug treatment).\nThe committee did not look at clinical- and cost-effectiveness evidence for the use of GLP‑1 mimetics to control blood glucose levels. As a result, the committee were unable to update the 2015 GLP‑1 mimetic recommendations in this update. However, the committee were concerned that, as written, the 2015 recommendation on GLP1‑mimetics would mean that people taking newer drugs with proven cardiovascular benefit, such as SGLT2 inhibitors, would have to switch to a combination of metformin, a sulfonylurea and a GLP‑1 mimetic. They agreed that this might be clinically inappropriate and not in keeping with current clinical practice, so they amended recommendation 1.7.21 to remove the requirement for this specific combination of treatment options. The rest of the recommendation and the other recommendations for GLP‑1 mimetics were out of scope for this update, so the criteria for accessing a GLP‑1 mimetic remain unchanged. These recommendations set tight limits on who should be offered a GLP‑1 mimetic, based on the lack of cost effectiveness of this treatment for most people in the 2015 guideline.\n\n## How the recommendations might affect practice\nSince no new drug options have been added to later stages of treatment, these recommendations are not expected to lead to an increase in resource impact over that detailed above for starting drug treatment with metformin and an SGLT2 inhibitor, or an SGLT2 inhibitor alone, or for people who are already on drug therapy when an SGLT2 inhibitor is or becomes appropriate based on their cardiovascular risk.\nRemoving the previous restriction limiting the use of GLP‑1 mimetics to combination therapy with metformin and a sulfonylurea may increase the use of GLP‑1 mimetics at later stages of the treatment pathway by making additional combinations of triple therapy that include GLP‑1 mimetics available to eligible people. However, these drugs are already widely used in some areas and this change may bring the guideline into line with current practice.\nReturn to recommendations\n\n# Long-acting insulin\nRecommendations 1.7.30 to 1.7.32\n\n## Why the committee made the recommendations\nBiosimilars have the potential to offer the NHS considerable cost savings. To gain approval for use, biosimilar medicines have to be shown to be safe and as effective as the original reference medicine, and have the same quality. Based on this understanding, the committee noted it was appropriate when starting a new prescription of an insulin where a biosimilar is available, to use the one with the lowest cost.\nAdditionally, people may be using an insulin for which a lower cost biosimilar is available. In such cases, the committee recommended discussing with people the possibility of switching to the biosimilar. This could happen at the person's routine review. They also agreed that switching to the biosimilar should be carefully planned, taking into consideration the dose-switching protocols, monitoring and the person's concerns about switching from their existing regimen, and a shared decision reached. Healthcare professionals should also refer to the summary of product characteristics for further information when considering switching to biosimilars.\nReturn to recommendations\n\n# SGLT2 inhibitors for adults with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease\nRecommendations 1.8.16 to 1.8.20\n\n## Why the committee made the recommendations\nStrong evidence from well-conducted randomised controlled trials showed that SGLT2 inhibitors reduced the risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression, mortality and cardiovascular events in adults with type 2 diabetes and CKD.\nEconomic modelling for people with an albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) above 30 mg/mol at baseline showed that SGLT2 inhibitors were likely to be both more effective and cost saving in this group compared with standard treatment.\nPeople with a baseline ACR of 3 mg/mmol to 30 mg/mmol will experience fewer cardiovascular events and events relating to CKD progression than people with a higher ACR. Because of this, SGLT2 inhibitors would prevent fewer events for this group in absolute terms, even if the relative effect was the same. Economic modelling showed that SGLT2 inhibitors were still likely to be both more effective and cost saving in people with a baseline ACR of between 3 mg/mol and 30 mg/mol compared with standard treatment. However, there was more uncertainty around the clinical and cost effectiveness in this group than in people with a baseline ACR over 30 mg/mmol. Because of this, SGLT2 inhibitors may not be suitable for everyone with a baseline ACR of between 3 mg/mmol and 30 mg/mmol, and the committee made a different recommendation for this group.\nThere was no evidence specifically looking at the effectiveness of SGLT2 inhibitors for people with a baseline ACR of less than 3 mg/mol, so the committee made a recommendation for research for this group.\nThe committee cautioned that SGLT2 inhibitors are not suitable for everyone and should only be used within their marketing authorisation.\nSome ethnic groups have a higher risk of micro- and macrovascular complications and so may benefit more from SGLT2 inhibitors. However, no evidence was found that stratified data by ethnicity. To address this gap, the committee made a recommendation for research.\nFor an explanation of why the committee recommended angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, see the section on pharmacotherapy in NICE's guideline on chronic kidney disease.\n\n## How the recommendations might affect practice\nThe recommendations will lead to a significant change in practice, since SGLT2 inhibitors will be prescribed more widely. This will result in a substantial cost impact. The committee noted, however, that there was likely to be a long-term cost saving from reduced downstream treatment costs, as SGLT2 inhibitors slow CKD progression and reduce the number of cardiovascular and end-stage renal events.\nReturn to recommendations\n\n# Periodontitis\nRecommendations 1.8.1 to 1.8.4\n\n## Why the committee made the recommendations\nThe evidence showed that people with diabetes are at increased risk of periodontitis, and that non-surgical periodontal treatment can improve diabetes control. However, in the committee's experience, people with diabetes are often unaware of this and may not be having regular oral health reviews. To address this, the committee recommended routinely discussing the risk of periodontitis at annual reviews, alongside eye disease and foot problems.\nThe evidence also showed that periodontal treatment is cost effective for people with type 2 diabetes, assuming improvements in HbA1c are maintained. This was tested with health economic modelling in a range of different scenarios. There were some scenarios where periodontal treatment was not cost effective, but the committee did not think these scenarios reflected real-world practice.\n\n## How the recommendations might affect practice\nFor oral healthcare professionals, the long-term impact of the recommendations is uncertain. The recommendations specify that people should follow existing NICE guidelines on oral health. However, the recommendations may also increase awareness of periodontitis, leading to a possible short-term increase in the number of oral health reviews. Any increase in the number of oral health reviews will potentially impact on services, as NHS dental services already have capacity issues.\nA short-term increase in the number of oral health reviews will also lead to a short-term increase in costs. However, there is likely to be a larger long-term reduction in costs from the improvement to oral health and diabetes control.\nOral healthcare and dental teams will need clear advice on what they need to do for people with diabetes. They will need clear care pathways to improve quality of care and service delivery, in line with the NHS England commissioning standard on dental care for people with diabetes.\nMany people do not have regular oral health reviews, even if they are eligible for free NHS dental care. People are eligible for free dental care if they are:\npregnant\nmothers with babies under 1 year old\n-n low income benefits, or under 20 and dependent on someone who is receiving low income benefits\nhaving treatment in an NHS hospital by the hospital dentist.\nThe recommendations may encourage more people with diabetes to have regular oral health reviews. Combined with proactive engagement and enhanced support for people with diabetes, this may broaden access to dental and oral healthcare and help to reduce oral health inequalities.\nReturn to recommendations# Context\nType 2 diabetes is a chronic metabolic condition characterised by insulin resistance (that is, the body's inability to effectively use insulin) and insufficient pancreatic insulin production, resulting in high blood glucose levels (hyperglycaemia). Type 2 diabetes is commonly associated with obesity, physical inactivity, raised blood pressure, periodontitis, disturbed blood lipid levels and a tendency to develop thrombosis, and is therefore recognised to have an increased cardiovascular risk. It is associated with long‑term microvascular and macrovascular complications, together with reduced quality of life and life expectancy.\nIn 2019, approximately 3.2 million adults in the UK had diagnosed diabetes. About 90% of these people had type 2 diabetes. Type 2 diabetes is more common in people of African, African‑Caribbean and South Asian family background. It can occur in all age groups and is increasingly being diagnosed in adolescents and young adults.\nMultiple vascular risk factors and wide‑ranging complications make diabetes care complex and time-consuming, and many areas of healthcare services must be involved for optimal management. Necessary lifestyle changes, and the complexities and possible side effects of therapy, make structured education and self‑management important aspects of diabetes care. Diabetes care is estimated to account for at least 5% of UK healthcare expenditure, and up to 10% of NHS expenditure.\nThis guideline contains recommendations for managing type 2 diabetes in adults, and focuses on education, dietary advice, managing cardiovascular risk, managing blood glucose levels, and identifying and managing long‑term complications. The guideline does not cover diagnosis, secondary diabetes, type 1 diabetes in adults, diabetes in pregnancy or diabetes in children and young people.", "source": "nice", "question": "According to an authoritative guideline, discuss how you would select and sequence first‑line pharmacological treatment for a newly diagnosed adult with type 2 diabetes, including how to assess and use cardiovascular disease status and cardiovascular risk to inform the choice between metformin and SGLT2 inhibitors, how to proceed when metformin is contraindicated or not tolerated, the recommended approach to introducing combination therapy, and the key safety checks and patient discussions (for example about diabetic ketoacidosis risk) that should precede starting an SGLT2 inhibitor."}

{"guideline_text": "Naloxegol for treating opioid‑induced constipation\n\nEvidence-based recommendations on naloxegol (Moventig) for treating opioid-induced constipation in adults.\n\n# Guidance\nNaloxegol is recommended, within its marketing authorisation, as an option for treating opioid induced constipation in adults whose constipation has not adequately responded to laxatives.\nAn inadequate response is defined as opioid‑induced constipation symptoms of at least moderate severity in at least 1 of the 4 stool symptom domains (that is, incomplete bowel movement, hard stools, straining or false alarms) while taking at least 1 laxative class for at least 4 days during the prior 2 weeks.# The technology \nNaloxegol (Moventig, AstraZeneca) is a form of naloxol which has been pegylated (that is, attached to a molecule of polyethylene glycol, or PEG). In this form, it selectively antagonises peripheral opioid receptors to relieve constipation. It has a marketing authorisation for treating opioid‑induced constipation (OIC) in adults whose constipation has had an inadequate response to laxative(s). The summary of product characteristics defines an inadequate response to laxatives as concurrent symptoms of OIC of at least moderate severity while taking at least 1 laxative class for a minimum of 4 days during the last 2 weeks. The European public assessment report for naloxegol provides further clarification regarding the definition of an inadequate response to laxatives. It states that a person must have been taking 1 laxative class for a minimum of 4 days out of the 14 days prior to the screening visit and report moderate, severe, or very severe symptoms in at least 1 of the 4 stool symptom domains.\nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions to naloxegol are abdominal pain, diarrhoea, nausea, headache and flatulence. The majority of gastrointestinal adverse reactions are graded as mild to moderate, occur early in treatment and resolve with continued treatment. For full details of adverse reactions and contraindications, see the summary of product characteristics.\nThe list price for naloxegol, which has been agreed by the Department of Health, is £55.20 per 30‑tablet pack of 12.5‑mg or 25‑mg film‑coated tablets. The recommended dose is 25 mg taken orally once daily (or 12.5 mg for people with renal insufficiency). Costs may vary in different settings because of negotiated procurement discounts.# The company's submission\nThe Appraisal Committee (section 7) considered evidence submitted by AstraZeneca and a review of this submission by the Evidence Review Group (ERG; section 8).\n\n# Clinical effectiveness\nThe main clinical evidence for naloxegol came from the pivotal phase III trials KODIAC 4 (n=649) and KODIAC 5 (n=697). These were international, multicentre, randomised, double‑blind, placebo‑controlled trials comparing naloxegol with placebo in adults with non‑cancer pain and opioid‑induced constipation (OIC). Patients included in the trials had a stable maintenance opioid regimen for non‑cancer related pain for a minimum of 4 weeks, and reported less than 3 spontaneous bowel movements (SBM) per week in the 2 weeks before screening. In addition, patients reported at least 1 of the following symptoms: Bristol Stool Scale stool type 1 or 2; moderate severe or very severe straining; incomplete bowel movement (BM), in at least 25% of BMs recorded in the patient's electronic diary during the OIC confirmation period. The 2 trials excluded patients having opioids for cancer‑related pain.\nIn both trials, patients were randomised in a 1:1:1 ratio to either naloxegol 12.5 mg, naloxegol 25 mg or placebo once daily for 12 weeks. Patients were allowed to continue their baseline opioid pain control regimen with doses adjusted according to clinical need. They were also allowed to have bisacodyl rescue laxative if they had not had a bowel movement in 72 hours or more. The proportion of patients in the naloxegol 25 mg arm who used bisacodyl at least once was 54.7% (KODIAC 4) and 57.3% (KODIAC 5). In the placebo arm, these proportions were 72% and 70.7% respectively. No other laxatives were allowed in the trials.\nBefore the studies, the company defined several subgroups in terms of response to laxatives at baseline, using the baseline laxative response status questionnaire. The categories defined by the company were as follows:\nLaxative inadequate responder (LIR): people who were taking 1 or more laxative class for at least 4 days before screening and reported moderate, severe or very severe symptoms in at least 1 of the 4 stool symptom domains (that is, incomplete BMs, hard stools, straining or false alarms). Around half of the clinical trial populations (54.6% in KODIAC 4 and 53.2% in KODIAC 5) were classified as laxative inadequate responders. This is the group covered by naloxegol's marketing authorisation.\nLaxative adequate responder (LAR): people whose constipation responded adequately to laxatives taken at least 4 days before screening and who reported mild or no symptoms.\nLaxative unknown responder (LUR): people who had not had laxatives in the last 2 weeks or had taken laxatives for less than 4 days in the last 2 weeks.\nAn additional subgroup was defined as the 2xLIR population. These were people who met the criteria for LIR but had at least 2 laxatives classes, or reported unsatisfactory relief from 1 or more additional laxative class taken during the 6 months before screening.\nThe company also conducted a post‑hoc analysis of the LIR+step‑3 opioids subgroup, comprising patients in the LIR population who had step‑3 opioids (classified according to the World Health Organisation analgesic ladder). The company stated that this is a clinically valid subgroup of patients with OIC, because the more severe forms are more likely to be related to the use of step‑3 opioids.\nThe primary outcome of the KODIAC 4 and 5 studies was response to treatment, defined as the proportion of patients with 3 or more SBMs per week, with improvement from baseline of 1 or more SBM per week for at least 9 of 12 weeks and 3 of the last 4 weeks of the study. SBM was defined as a bowel movement without using laxatives in the last 24 hours). The company stated that SBM frequency is a clinically meaningful measure commonly employed in clinical research to assess the efficacy of a treatment for chronic constipation.\nThe main secondary outcomes included:\nresponse to treatment (as defined for the primary outcome) in the LIR population only\ntime to first post‑dose SBM without the use of rescue medication in the last 24 hours\nmean number of days per week with at least 1 SBM.\nIn both KODIAC trials, treatment with naloxegol 25 mg (the recommended dose for all patients except those with renal insufficiency) resulted in significantly higher response rates than placebo in both the overall population (KODIAC 4: 44.4% compared with 29.4%, p=0.001; KODIAC 5: 29.3% compared with 39.7%, p=0.021) and the LIR population (KODIAC 4: 48.7% compared with 28.8%, p=0.002; KODIAC 5: 46.8% compared with 31.4%, p=0.014). In both studies, naloxegol showed consistent improvements in a range of secondary end points, including time to first post‑dose SBM, total SBMs per week, number of days per week with at least 1 SBM and use of rescue medication at least once over the treatment period. The 3 instruments used by the company to measure quality of life (PAC‑SYM, PAC‑QoL and EQ‑5D) also showed advantages with naloxegol compared with placebo.\nThere were no differences in adverse events between the overall and LIR populations. The most frequently reported adverse events were gastrointestinal in nature (predominantly diarrhoea, abdominal pain, nausea and flatulence); this is to be expected, considering the nature of OIC and naloxegol's pharmacological mechanism of action. Gastrointestinal adverse events were more frequent in the naloxegol 25 mg arms compared with naloxegol 12.5 mg and placebo. There were no notable differences in type or frequency of serious adverse events across the treatment arms of the studies. The incidence of discontinuations because of adverse events was dose‑related, with a higher proportion of patients discontinuing in the naloxegol 25 mg arm compared with those having naloxegol 12.5 mg and placebo. The discontinuation rate with the longer‑term use of naloxegol (52 weeks, as observed in KODIAC 8) was similar to that seen in the 12‑week studies, KODIAC 4 and 5.\n\n## Mixed treatment comparison\nThe company conducted a mixed treatment comparison of naloxegol with methylnaltrexone and naloxone‑oxycodone using data from KODIAC 4 and 5, 2 methylnaltrexone trials and 4 naloxone‑oxycodone trials. All 8 trials compared the active treatments with placebo. The company stated that only the naloxegol trials were able to provide data in the specific patient populations of interest, namely the LIR (covered by the marketing authorisation) and the LIR+step‑3 opioids subgroups. As none of the other studies reported data specifically for these 2 subgroups, the company used the main trial populations in these comparator studies to inform the mixed treatment comparison analyses.\n\n## Table 1 Summary of trials included in the mixed treatment comparison\nStudy, trial design and duration\nPatient population\nTreatment/dose\nOutcomes used in the Mixed Treatment Comparison\nNaloxegol\nKODIAC 4: phase III, double‑blind RCT, 12 weeks\nOIC patients with non‑malignant pain.

Generally, naloxegol 25 mg demonstrated improved outcomes when compared with methylnaltrexone, and naloxone‑oxycodone. None of these analyses yielded statistically significant results.\nThe results of the mixed treatment comparison suggested that methylnaltrexone and naloxone‑oxycodone as well as naloxegol were more likely than placebo to lead to discontinuations because of adverse events or treatment‑emergent adverse events. Naloxegol 25 mg had a similar or lower rate of discontinuations because of adverse events compared with all methylnaltrexone and naloxone regimens evaluated, except when it was compared with naloxone‑oxycodone. Treatment‑related adverse effects were more likely with naloxegol 25 mg than with subcutaneous methylnaltrexone, but this was not statistically significant.\n\n# Evidence Review Group comments\nThe ERG commented that some studies that were potentially relevant may have been omitted from the mixed treatment comparison because of how the company defined and adhered to the criteria in its literature search. For example, the difference in population specification between the scope and the company's submission (that is, limiting the naloxegol studies in the submission to the LIR subgroup) is likely to have reduced the number of studies included.\nThe ERG stated that insufficient details were presented for comparator study design, quality and data. It stated that the definition of rescue treatment varied between trials and there was not enough information to judge the similarity of the rescue treatments used. It also noted that the company did not present details of the baseline characteristics for the comparator studies, thereby preventing any further assessment of their similarities. The ERG felt that these limitations prevented further analyses based on baseline characteristics (for pain intensity, opioid dose, duration of opioid use, duration of OIC and previous laxative use).\nThe ERG questioned the reliability of the mixed treatment comparison because it compared the LIR population only from KODIAC 4 and 5 with the overall population from the comparator studies. The ERG conducted its own exploratory analyses using the overall populations from all trials, including KODIAC 4 and 5. The results of these analyses were similar to the company's results, which the ERG felt suggested there were unlikely to be any major differences between the LIR and intention‑to‑treat populations. However, it questioned whether combining the 2 populations in a mixed treatment comparison as the company had, could be clinically justified. The ERG stated that overall there was no robust evidence to distinguish the relative efficacy and safety between naloxegol and the comparators of interest.\n\n# Cost effectiveness\nThe company constructed a decision‑analytic model comparing the cost effectiveness of naloxegol 25 mg with several comparators for OIC that has responded inadequately to laxatives (that is, the population covered by the marketing authorisation). The comparator for the base‑case analysis was placebo (as in the pivotal clinical trials KODIAC 4 and 5), whereas methylnaltrexone was used in a scenario analysis. The company also presented an analysis of the LIR+step‑3 opioids subgroup, in which the comparators were placebo, methylnaltrexone and naloxone‑oxycodone.\nThe company presented 2 additional analyses which it considered to be the most clinically relevant comparisons (based on clinical guidance from an advisory board and company‑sponsored research):\nNaloxegol compared with placebo plus bisacodyl (where bisacodyl was a proxy for using stimulant laxatives as needed).\nNaloxegol plus bisacodyl compared with placebo plus bisacodyl (to demonstrate the cost effectiveness of naloxegol when used with a stimulant laxative).\nThe company's economic model comprised a decision‑tree structure for the first 4 weeks of treatment, followed by a Markov structure. All patients entered the model with OIC and were treated with naloxegol or a comparator. Response to treatment was assessed after 4 weeks, with people being classified as responders if they achieved constipation relief and as non‑responders if they did not.\nThe Markov model consisted of 4 health states: opioid‑induced constipation (OIC), non‑OIC (on treatment), non‑OIC (untreated) and death. OIC and non‑OIC were defined as follows:\nOIC: less than 3 SBMs per week in at least 2 of the last 4 weeks.\nNon‑OIC: 3 or more SBMs per week in at least 3 of the last 4 weeks.The company justified this change from the clinical definition of OIC because it corresponds with internationally accepted definitions of constipation (although these were not specified) and helped to simplify the model by allowing utility and resource to be estimated as a function of constipation status, rather than a change in that status. People whose constipation responded to treatment after 4 weeks entered the Markov phase of the model in the non‑OIC (on treatment) health state, whereas those who did not respond to treatment by week 4 entered in the OIC health state. People may move between the OIC and non‑OIC state in the model even in the absence of effective treatment. The company stated that clinical expert opinion and trial data suggested that patients in the placebo arm moved between the OIC and non‑OIC states.\nThe time horizon in the company's base case was 5 years. The company felt this reflected the upper end of a period of opioid use and the model suggested that it reaches a steady state within that period. Scenario analyses were done using several other time horizons to test the effect on cost effectiveness. The cycle length was 4 weeks and a half‑cycle correction was applied. The company applied a discount of 3.5% for costs and benefits and adopted an NHS/personal social services perspective.\nThe proportion of people in the non‑OIC (on treatment) state of the model was estimated based on response rates derived from the KODIAC 4 and 5 trials. For the comparisons with methylnaltrexone and naloxone‑oxycodone, the outcomes of the mixed treatment comparison were used. To estimate transitions from the non‑OIC (on treatment) state to the OIC state, the company conducted parametric survival analyses based on data from the KODIAC trials; this informed the prediction of how many patients remained in the non‑OIC (treated) health state for 5 years. The exponential distribution was used for both arms in the base case. For the comparisons with methylnaltrexone and naloxone‑oxycodone, the curves were estimated based on the naloxegol curve, assuming proportional hazards and using the hazard ratios estimated from the mixed treatment comparison. The company also did a scenario analysis in which the hazard ratio for methylnaltrexone compared with naloxegol was set to 1 (assuming equal treatment effect for both treatments).\nThe company's estimates for transitions from the OIC health state to the non‑OIC (untreated) health state and from the non‑OIC (untreated) health state to the OIC health state were generated from an analysis of the LIR population in the placebo arms of KODIAC 4 and 5. The company analysed the placebo data because the model assumed that patients are not on treatment in the OIC and non‑OIC (untreated) health states. This same transition estimate was assumed for all comparators in the model.\nFor the transition to death, the company applied the same mortality rate to all health states (based on the UK general population). Mortality was calculated based on the UK life table for 2008–10. The company used the exponential function to calculate cycle probability of mortality.\nUtility estimates in the economic model were derived from an analysis of KODIAC 4 and 5 EQ‑5D data, collected at 0, 4 and 12 weeks. These data were used with the Dolan algorithm to derive utility scores. Based on the results of a regression analysis, the company applied time‑ and treatment‑specific utilities in the base case for the comparison with placebo. The company also presented scenario analyses applying treatment‑specific utilities only and health state‑specific utilities only. Only health state‑specific utilities were used for the comparisons with methylnaltrexone and naloxone‑oxycodone. No direct estimates of the effect of adverse events on utility were included in the model. The company stated that its clinicians advised that adverse events were unlikely to make a difference to health‑related quality of life.\nCosts incorporated in the company's model included drug costs, administration costs for methylnaltrexone, laxative costs, adverse events costs, opioid costs for the naloxegol arm of the comparison with naloxone‑oxycodone, and other costs for managing constipation (including inpatient care, outpatient care, emergency care, GP visit and consultation, nurse visits, rescue therapy and medical tests). The company assumed that patients having naloxone‑oxycodone did not incur additional opioid costs (because of the presence of oxycodone). Therefore, the company presented 2 separate scenarios applying opioid costs to the naloxegol arm of the comparison with naloxone‑oxycodone. The first scenario used morphine (the most commonly prescribed step‑3 opioid) and the second used oxycodone. The company's estimates of resource use associated with managing constipation and adverse events were based on a survey of clinicians. Costs were based on the British national formulary, NHS reference costs and the Payment by Results tariff.\n\n# Company's base‑case results and sensitivity analyses (naloxegol compared with placebo)\nIn the company's base‑case analysis (based on KODIAC 4 and 5 data), the incremental cost‑effectiveness ratio (ICER) for naloxegol compared with placebo was £10,849 per quality‑adjusted life year (QALY) gained. However, the company stated that the most clinically relevant comparisons are as follows:\nNaloxegol compared with placebo plus bisacodyl (ICER of £12,639 per QALY gained).\nNaloxegol plus bisacodyl compared with placebo plus bisacodyl (ICER of £11,175 per QALY gained).\nThe company conducted a number of 1‑way sensitivity analyses to demonstrate the model's robustness to changes in parameters and assumptions. In nearly all of the sensitivity analyses, naloxegol produced an ICER of less than £20,000 per QALY gained. The company also conducted several scenario analyses including: using alternative utility input assumptions; using the burden of illness data for resource use costs of managing constipation; assuming no extrapolation beyond the trial period (that is, using a time horizon of 12 weeks); and using alternative functions to estimate the transitions in the model. Of these, only 2 scenarios produced an ICER for naloxegol that was over £20,000 per QALY gained. Using a 12‑week time horizon resulted in ICERs of £20,020 per QALY gained for naloxegol compared with placebo and £33,708 per QALY gained for naloxegol compared with placebo plus bisacodyl. When a health state‑specific utility input was employed, the ICER for naloxegol compared with placebo increased to £38,921 per QALY gained, and the ICER for naloxegol compared with placebo plus bisacodyl increased to £63,423 per QALY gained. The company did not present results of these 2 scenario analyses for naloxegol plus bisacodyl compared with placebo plus bisacodyl.\nFor the analysis comparing naloxegol with subcutaneous methylnaltrexone every other day, the results showed that naloxegol dominated methylnaltrexone (that is, naloxegol was more effective and cost less than methylnaltrexone).\nFor the analysis of the LIR+step‑3 opioids subgroup, naloxegol dominated methylnaltrexone and naloxone‑oxycodone (when oral morphine was added to the naloxegol arm). For the different placebo comparisons (with and without bisacodyl), the ICERs were less than £7000 per QALY gained. The ICER increased to £34,054 per QALY gained for naloxegol compared with naloxone‑oxycodone when oxycodone was added to the naloxegol arm.\nThe company did not do a subgroup analysis on patients with cancer who have OIC. However, it stated that there is no scientific rationale to expect the pharmacodynamic properties of naloxegol to differ in this patient population, because the underlying physiology of pain is the same regardless of the underlying cause. The company stated that pain medications act on the same target receptors regardless of whether the trigger for the pain is cancer or non‑cancer. Because of this, extrapolating the available data to the treatment of OIC in patients with cancer pain was justified. The company also stated that patients with cancer and OIC would fit in the acceptable range for the key model variables which resulted in ICERs of less than £20,000 per QALY gained for naloxegol compared with each comparator.\n\n# ERG comments\nThe ERG indicated that the company's model was generally well presented and reported. It noted that the model structure was based on a revised definition of response (3 or more SBMs per week in at least 3 out of the last 4 weeks) compared with that used in the clinical studies (which also included an improvement of 1 or more SBM per week for 9 weeks out of 12). Because of this, the model was able to use absolute health states rather than health states relative to a baseline. The ERG considered the 5‑year time horizon to be acceptable.\nThe ERG noted that the modelled population was based on the marketing authorisation for naloxegol (that is, people who constipation has had an inadequate response to laxatives). However, it questioned whether the trial definition of inadequate response to laxatives (see section 3.3) reflected clinical practice. It argued that although the effectiveness of some types of laxative can be reasonably assessed after 4 days (for example bisacodyl), others – such as lactulose – may need to be used for slightly longer before their effectiveness can be fully assessed.\nThe ERG stated that the main weakness of the cost‑effectiveness analysis was the definition of intervention and comparator. It noted that the cost‑effectiveness analysis compared naloxegol with placebo based on SBM in the base case, and naloxegol plus bisacodyl with placebo plus bisacodyl based on bowel movement in a scenario analysis. However, the ERG considered the base‑case analysis (that is, naloxegol without bisacodyl) to be neither clinically relevant nor consistent with the KODIAC 4 and 5 trials in which rescue medication was permitted in all arms. The ERG argued that the use of naloxegol without rescue medication in clinical practice is implausible considering that the rates of SBM in the trial may have been affected by the use of rescue medication.\nThe ERG stated that EQ‑5D data were available from the clinical studies to inform the utilities used in the model, thus providing good quality evidence for the cost‑effectiveness analysis. However, the ERG stated that it would have been preferable for the company to use health state‑specific utilities in its base case for the comparison of naloxegol with placebo rather than treatment‑specific utilities because there was insufficient evidence to suggest an independent treatment effect of naloxegol on health‑related quality of life. The ERG also commented with regards to the health‑related quality of life analysis that the non‑OIC health state is too broad to be homogeneous. Using the company's definition of response, any patient with at least 9 SBMs over a 28‑day period would be classified as a responder (and so move to the non‑OIC on treatment state). However, patients with 28 or more SBMs over this period would be considered to be in the same health state and have the same quality of life as patients who had only 9 SBMs, which the ERG considered to be unlikely. The ERG stated that the model should have included more discrete health states which were more reflective of patient experience and this would have allowed the company to apply health‑state specific utilities.\nThe ERG performed an exploratory base‑case analysis comparing naloxegol plus bisacodyl with placebo plus bisacodyl. The outcome was SBM, rather than bowel movement as the company had used in its own analysis. The ERG commented that this was the only accurate comparison that could be made using the data from KODIAC 4 and 5. The analysis increased the ICER for naloxegol compared with placebo to £10,864 per QALY gained.\nThe ERG conducted an exploratory sensitivity analysis on response rate as a proxy for the 2xLIR population (see section 3.4). The ERG extracted the response rates at 4 weeks for the LIR and 2xLIR populations from KODIAC 4 and 5. Using these data, it calculated a pooled response rate for the 2xLIR population using an adjusted response rate as a proxy for that population. The ERG noted that there was a marked difference in response rates in the naloxegol arm compared with the placebo arm between the LIR and 2xLIR populations. The response rate for the LIR subgroup was 20.4% better in the naloxegol arm than the placebo arm, and the response rate in the 2xLIR population was 13.5 % better in the naloxegol arm than in the placebo arm. The ERG assumed that all other input parameters would be the same as the company's base case, because there were no 2xLIR data to inform the various transition probabilities in the model. This analysis increased the ICER for naloxegol compared with placebo from £10,849 per QALY gained (in the company's base case) to £11,406 per QALY gained. The ERG also conducted a sensitivity analysis exploring the impact of changing the parametric distribution of the time‑to‑event curve used to estimate the transition probability from non‑OIC (on treatment) to opioid‑induced constipation. The ERG noted that in its analyses, the company used the same parametric function for both placebo and naloxegol. Instead, the ERG used different combinations of the following distributions: exponential, Weibull, lognormal and loglogistic. The ERG compared naloxegol plus bisacodyl with placebo plus bisacodyl and most cases, the ICER was similar to or lower than the company's base case ICER. The ICERs only increased beyond £13,000 per QALY gained when the exponential distribution was used for naloxegol and either the lognormal or loglogistic distribution was used for placebo.\nThe ERG conducted threshold analyses on the hazard ratio for the transition from the non‑OIC (on treatment) state to the OIC state for methylnaltrexone and naloxone‑oxycodone. In the company's model, the hazard ratios for this transition were calculated using the ratio between the 4‑week response rates for methylnaltrexone and naloxone‑oxycodone and the response rate of naloxegol 25 mg. None of the additional economic analysis by the ERG resulted in ICERs that differed from the company's results in any meaningful way. For this reason the ERG considered that the company's cost‑effectiveness results were generally robust. However, given that the company did not perform a full mixed treatment comparison, the ERG cautioned that the results of the comparisons with methylnaltrexone and naloxone‑oxycodone should be interpreted with care.\nFull details of all the evidence are available.# Consideration of the evidence\nThe Appraisal Committee reviewed the data available on the clinical and cost effectiveness of naloxegol, having considered evidence on the nature of opioid‑induced constipation (OIC) and the value placed on the benefits of naloxegol by people with the condition, those who represent them, and clinical experts. It also took into account the effective use of NHS resources.\nThe Committee considered the experience of people with OIC and the clinical need for treatment options for people with this condition. The Committee heard from clinical experts that most people taking opioids experience constipation and that constipation is a painful and uncomfortable condition that can lead to other physical and psychological problems. It heard from the patient expert that constipation has a substantial impact on quality of life, including increased time spent on bowel care and reliance on help from others. The Committee also heard that frequency of bowel movements is less important to people than ease of bowel movements in terms of impact on quality of life. The clinical experts stated that in some people taking opioids, constipation does not respond adequately to conventional laxatives because they do not specifically target OIC. The Committee also heard from clinical experts that in an attempt to relieve their constipation some people reduce their opioids, but this tends to reduce the effect of the opioid on the pain without relieving the constipation. Therefore, alternative treatment options for treating OIC are needed in clinical practice. The Committee accepted that naloxegol was a new treatment option for OIC that has not responded adequately to laxatives.\nThe Committee considered the treatment pathway for people with opioid‑induced constipation. The Committee heard from the clinical experts that people with OIC would use a stimulant laxative and an osmotic laxative before moving on to other treatments such as methylnaltrexone. The clinical experts stated that the decision to move on to other treatments will depend on the severity of constipation symptoms and the person's own quality of life after using laxatives. The Committee understood that there is no formal treatment pathway for people with OIC. It noted that there was currently limited evidence on which to base any clinical guidelines for OIC, and that what guidance exists is based on clinical consensus rather than study evidence.\nThe Committee noted that the marketing authorisation for naloxegol is for the treatment of OIC in adult patients who have had an inadequate response to laxative(s) and that the trials and summary of product characteristics for naloxegol defines an inadequate response to laxative(s) as moderate, severe or very severe symptoms of opioid induced constipation in at least 1 of the 4 stool symptom domains (that is, incomplete bowel movement, hard stools, straining or false alarms) while taking at least 1 laxative class for at least 4 days during the prior 2 weeks and took this into consideration in its decision making.\nThe Committee discussed the relevant comparators for this appraisal. The Committee was aware that in its evidence submission, the company compared naloxegol with methylnaltrexone, naloxone‑oxycodone and placebo with and without bisacodyl. The clinical experts observed that in clinical practice bisacodyl is not usually given as a laxative but as a rescue medication. The Committee heard from the clinical experts that naloxone‑oxycodone is not used frequently in UK clinical practice because it is produced as a fixed‑ratio combination of a laxative and an opioid in which the opioid, oxycodone, cannot be titrated without also having to titrate the naloxone. Because of this, some people would not be able to take it. The Committee heard from the clinical experts that methylnaltrexone is effective in this group of people and would be the most relevant of the comparators assessed in the company's evidence submission. However, the clinical experts also indicated that not everybody can have methylnaltrexone because of its subcutaneous route of administration, monitoring and X‑ray requirements, and adverse effects. The Committee heard that naloxegol would be an alternative to methylnaltrexone and would be similarly positioned in the treatment pathway after treatment with a stimulant and osmotic laxative had failed. The Committee agreed that it would consider analyses for all the comparators presented in the company's submission, but concluded that methylnaltrexone was the most relevant comparator for this appraisal.\n\n# Clinical effectiveness\nThe Committee considered the clinical effectiveness of naloxegol as seen in the KODIAC 4 and 5 trials, which compared naloxegol with placebo in people with OIC. It was aware that the marketing authorisation for naloxegol covers only people whose constipation had not adequately responded to laxatives and that an inadequate response to laxatives was defined in the trials and in the summary of product characteristics (see section 4.3). It noted the Evidence Review Group's (ERG's) concerns that it may take more than 4 days to assess the effectiveness of some laxatives. The company stated that most patients in the trial had used the laxatives for more than 4 days before being classed as inadequate responders, and that 4 days was the minimum duration of use. The clinical experts stated that although some laxatives will take longer than 4 days for their effectiveness to be established, the majority will work within this time. The Committee questioned whether the trial definition of laxative‑inadequate response was relevant in clinical practice in England. It heard from the clinical experts that the definition of laxative‑inadequate response is subjective in clinical practice, and that the company's definition was reasonable. The clinical experts also stated that the decision to consider alternative treatments in practice would depend on a person's quality of life after using laxatives. The Committee accepted the definition of inadequate response to laxatives used in the clinical trials and in the summary of product characteristics for naloxegol.\nThe Committee discussed the generalisability of the KODIAC 4 and 5 studies to the population in England with OIC. It was aware that the trials were mainly done in the USA and that some of the baseline characteristics of the trial population differed from the population of England with OIC. It noted that the proportion of people who were obese in the studies was higher than the proportion of people who are obese in England. In addition, the average age of the patients included in the studies was 52.2 years, whereas the population in England who take opioids is likely to be older, particularly in people with cancer pain. The Committee heard from the clinical experts that although these baseline characteristics differed between the trial population and the population in England with OIC, the efficacy of naloxegol was not expected to be affected by age or weight and that the results of the trials would be generalisable to people with OIC in England. The Committee also heard from the company that its post‑hoc subgroup analyses reported in the European Public Assessment report for naloxegol, showed naloxegol to be effective compared with placebo regardless of age or weight. The Committee concluded that the KODIAC 4 and 5 trials could be generalised to the population seen in clinical practice in England and that it could use those results in its decision making.\nThe Committee also considered the generalisability of the results of the KODIAC 4 and 5 studies to people with cancer pain who have OIC. The Committee noted that both KODIAC 4 and 5 specifically excluded people with cancer. The Committee heard from the company that a separate study which included people with cancer was started, but was stopped due to extreme difficulties of enrolment for this group of people. The Committee heard from the company and clinical experts that it was difficult to enrol patients with cancer mainly because of short life‑expectancy. The Committee heard from the clinical experts that naloxegol was likely to be effective in people with cancer because naloxegol targets the OIC, rather than the underlying condition causing the pain. The Committee noted that the marketing authorisation for naloxegol did not exclude people taking opioids for cancer pain. However, it was aware that the summary of product characteristics includes some special warnings about the lack of clinical trial evidence in people with cancer and the contraindications for certain patients who are at heightened risk of gastrointestinal perforation (including people with cancer pain). Having heard from the clinical experts and considering the marketing authorisation, the Committee was persuaded that naloxegol would be equally effective in people with cancer pain who have OIC taking into account the special warnings highlighted in the summary of product characteristics. It therefore concluded that its recommendations regarding the use of naloxegol in clinical practice also applies to people with cancer pain who have OIC.\nThe Committee considered the results of KODIAC 4 and 5 presented by the company. It noted that the results suggested a statistically significant improvement over weeks 1 to 12 in the proportion of laxative‑inadequate responders who had spontaneous bowel movements (SBMs) in the naloxegol arm compared with the placebo arm (see section 3.8). The Committee heard that although the number of SBMs during the trial was important, the most clinically relevant outcome measure was the mean difference from baseline in SBMs. This is because there are large differences in the number of SBMs normally experienced by people without OIC. The Committee also noted that naloxegol was associated with statistically significant improvements in secondary outcomes, including health‑related quality of life compared with placebo in the KODIAC 4 and 5 studies (see section 3.8). Therefore, the Committee concluded that naloxegol was effective compared with placebo as shown by the data on SBM frequency in the KODIAC 4 and 5 studies in people with OIC that has not responded adequately to laxatives.\nThe Committee considered evidence on the company's mixed treatment comparison of naloxegol, methylnaltrexone and naloxone‑oxycodone. The Committee was aware that in the mixed treatment comparison, the company had used response rates from the laxative‑inadequate responder population in the naloxegol KODIAC 4 and 5 studies, and conversely, rates for the overall population from the methylnaltrexone and naloxone‑oxycodone studies. The Committee noted that the results from the ERG's exploratory mixed treatment comparison, in which it used data for the overall population from the KODIAC trials, did not differ substantially from the company's estimate. Nevertheless, the Committee considered that using 2 different populations introduced uncertainty in the company's analyses. The Committee also noted that none of the results from the mixed treatment comparison for naloxegol compared with methylnaltrexone and naloxone‑oxycodone were statistically significant, indicating that there was also uncertainty regarding its relative efficacy in the mixed treatment comparison. The Committee concluded that there was insufficient evidence that naloxegol's clinical effectiveness differed from that of methylnaltrexone and naloxone‑oxycodone, and that it was not unreasonable to use the mixed treatment comparison analysis in its decision‑making.\n\n# Cost effectiveness\nThe Committee discussed the company's cost‑effectiveness analysis. It considered all the comparisons provided by the company, including naloxegol compared with placebo (with and without bisacodyl), methylnaltrexone and naloxone‑oxycodone, noting that methylnaltrexone was the most appropriate comparator for this appraisal (see section 4.4), The Committee noted that the company's comparison of naloxegol with placebo included analyses with and without bisacodyl. However, it was aware that most patients in KODIAC 4 and 5 had bisacodyl as a rescue medication. It also noted the ERG's comments that the use of the rescue medication may have positively affected the SBM rates in the trial. The Committee concluded that the analysis without bisacodyl was neither clinically relevant nor consistent with the KODIAC 4 and 5 trials. Therefore, for the comparison with placebo, it did not consider the analysis without bisacodyl for both groups any further.\nThe Committee considered the company's economic model and the ERG's critique of the model. The Committee noted that the company's base case ICER for naloxegol plus bisacodyl compared with placebo plus bisacodyl was £11,200 per QALY gained. The Committee noted that for the analyses comparing naloxegol with placebo, the company designed its model to include time‑specific and treatment‑specific utilities. The Committee heard from the ERG that it would have been more appropriate to use health state‑dependent utility values only, rather than assuming different utilities for the treatment arms. The Committee noted that the company's base case ICER increased to £38,900 per QALY gained when the company used health state‑dependent utility values for naloxegol compared with placebo (without bisacodyl in both treatment groups). Similar analysis was not presented for the comparison that included bisacodyl in both treatment groups. The Committee understood from the ERG that the large increase in the ICER was a result of the model structure, in that the non‑OIC (on treatment) state in the model was too broad, that is, it included a heterogeneous group of patients with different number of SBMs during the same period (see section 3.34), and that applying a single utility value to that health state would not accurately reflect patient experience in that state. The ERG stated that the model should have included more discrete health states which were more reflective of patient experience and this would have allowed the company to apply health‑state specific utilities. However, the Committee understood from the ERG that taking this approach may not necessarily have changed the model results.\nThe Committee noted that there was less uncertainty when comparing naloxegol with methylnaltrexone and naloxone‑oxycodone, because health state‑specific utilities were used for these comparisons rather than treatment‑specific utilities. It noted that when compared with methylnaltrexone and naloxone‑oxycodone, naloxegol dominated (that is, naloxegol was both more effective and cheaper than) these treatments in almost every scenario (see sections 3.28 and 3.29), except when naloxegol was given with oxycodone compared with naloxone‑oxycodone (which produced an ICER of £34,100 per QALY gained). It also noted that the comparison of naloxegol with naloxone‑oxycodone was for the subgroup of people taking a step 3 opioid and not the full population covered by the marketing authorisation. In addition, the Committee had previously decided that naloxone‑oxycodone was not the most relevant comparator for this appraisal because it is not used frequently in UK clinical practice (see section 4.4). The Committee concluded that although the company's model had some limitations, overall it was acceptable for modelling treatment in this population.\nThe Committee considered the assumptions used by the company to model the duration of treatment response – that is, transition from the non‑OIC (on treatment) health state to the OIC health state. The Committee noted that for its base case, the company had chosen the exponential function for both naloxegol and placebo because it was the most conservative of the available functions. However, the Committee observed that after only 2 years nearly all patients having naloxegol transitioned from the non‑OIC (treated) health state to the OIC health state, which suggested that naloxegol lost its treatment effect over time. The Committee queried whether this was clinically plausible, and heard from clinical experts that if a patient were having opioids and naloxegol, there was no reason to expect that the treatment effect of naloxegol would lessen over time. The Committee also heard from the company that the discontinuation rates in the KODIAC 8 trial were very small, even though the trial lasted for 1 year. The Committee noted that in the ERG's exploratory analyses, the ICERs for naloxegol plus bisacodyl compared with placebo plus bisacodyl were mostly less than £13,000 per quality‑adjusted life year (QALY) gained (see sections 3.35 and 3.36). The Committee concluded that the ERG's exploratory analyses had little impact on the cost‑effectiveness results presented by the company.\nThe Committee considered the effect of the company's not conducting a fully incremental analysis (that is, calculating the incremental QALY gains and costs for all treatment options and ordered by increasing costs). The company stated that an incremental analysis was not possible, because the definition of response from the KODIAC trials as used in the placebo comparisons differed from the definition used for the mixed treatment comparison for the active comparators. The mixed treatment comparison analyses did not include all the comparators in the economic model (as requested by NICE during clarification) and therefore no comparable ICERs or incremental analysis was available from the mixed treatment comparison either. The Committee stated that it would have preferred to see a fully incremental analysis as described in the guide to methods of technology appraisals. However, the Committee considered methylnaltrexone to be the most relevant comparator, and because naloxegol dominated methylnaltrexone in the pairwise analysis (that is, naloxegol was both more effective and cheaper); it would also dominate it in an incremental analysis. The Committee concluded that the ICERs presented in the pairwise analyses were sufficient evidence on which to base its decisions.\nThe Committee considered whether naloxegol was a cost‑effective use of NHS resources compared with the comparators. The Committee noted that for all comparisons, the company's base‑case results and most of the company's sensitivity analyses resulted in ICERs below £20,000 per QALY gained (see section 3.27). It was aware that all sensitivity analyses by both the company and the ERG showed that the model was stable and the ICERs robust to most model changes (see section 3.37). The Committee noted that the ICERs were above £20,000 per QALY gained only when health state‑specific utilities were used and when the outcomes were not extrapolated beyond the trial period for naloxegol compared with placebo, and also when naloxegol was given with oxycodone compared with naloxone‑oxycodone (see sections 4.11 and 4.12). The Committee concluded that in light of the robustness of the company's model, the ICERs being mostly below £20,000 per QALY gained for the comparison of naloxegol plus bisacodyl with placebo plus bisacodyl, and naloxegol mostly dominating methylnaltrexone and naloxone‑oxycodone, naloxegol was considered a cost‑effective use of NHS resources. The Committee therefore recommended naloxegol as an option within its marketing authorisation for people with OIC that has not responded adequately to laxatives.\nThe Committee considered whether naloxegol could be considered innovative in its potential to make a substantial effect on health‑related benefits for people with opioid‑induced constipation and whether it could be considered a step‑change in the management of opioid‑induced constipation. The Committee heard from the company that the innovativeness of naloxegol was in the combination of its mode of action and formulation, because it offers more flexibility in dosing than naloxone‑oxycodone and can be used independently of the opioid being prescribed. The Committee heard from the clinical specialists that naloxegol would be a useful option for treating opioid‑induced constipation. It noted that naloxone has been in use for many years and that the only innovation it could discern was the attachment of a polyethylene glycol molecule to naloxone in order to prevent it from crossing the blood‑brain barrier. The Committee considered that although this addition was novel, there were no additional gains in health‑related quality of life over those already included in the QALY calculations.\nThe Appraisal Committee considered whether it should take into account the consequences of PPRS 2014, and in particular the PPRS Payment Mechanism, when appraising naloxegol. The Appraisal Committee noted NICE's position statement in this regard, and accepted the conclusion 'that the 2014 PPRS Payment Mechanism should not, as a matter of course, be regarded as a relevant consideration in its assessment of the cost effectiveness of branded medicines'. The Committee heard nothing to suggest that there is any basis for taking a different view with regard to the relevance of the PPRS to this appraisal of naloxegol. It therefore concluded that the PPRS Payment Mechanism was irrelevant for the consideration of cost effectiveness of naloxegol.\n\n# Summary of Appraisal Committee's key conclusions\nTA345\nAppraisal title: Naloxegol for treating opioid‑induced constipation\nSection\nKey conclusion\nNaloxegol is recommended, within its marketing authorisation, as an option for treating opioid induced constipation (OIC) in adults whose constipation has not adequately responded to laxatives.\nAn inadequate response is defined as OIC symptoms of at least moderate severity in at least 1 of the 4 stool symptom domains (that is, incomplete bowel movement, hard stools, straining or false alarms) while taking at least 1 laxative class for at least 4 days during the prior 2 weeks.\nThe Committee concluded that naloxegol compared with placebo was clinically effective as shown by the data on spontaneous bowel movements (SBMs) in the naloxegol KODIAC 4 and 5 studies in people with OIC that has not responded adequately to laxatives.\nThe Committee concluded that there was insufficient evidence that naloxegol's clinical effectiveness differed from that of methylnaltrexone and naloxone‑oxycodone, and that it was not unreasonable to use the mixed treatment comparison analysis in its decision‑making.\nThe Committee agreed that it would consider all the analyses presented in the company's submission which included placebo (with and without bisacodyl as rescue medication), methylnaltrexone and oxycodone‑naloxone as comparators to naloxegol, but concluded that methylnaltrexone was the most relevant comparator for this appraisal.\nThe Committee concluded that in light of the robustness of the company's model, the ICERs being mostly below £20,000 per QALY gained for the comparison of naloxegol plus bisacodyl with placebo plus bisacodyl, and naloxegol mostly dominating methylnaltrexone and naloxone‑oxycodone, naloxegol was considered a cost‑effective use of NHS resources. The Committee therefore recommended naloxegol as an option within its marketing authorisation for people with OIC that has not responded adequately to laxatives.\nCurrent practice\nClinical need of patients, including the availability of alternative treatments\nThe clinical experts stated that in some people taking opioids, constipation does not respond adequately to conventional laxatives because they do not specifically target OIC. The Committee also heard from clinical experts that in an attempt to relieve their constipation some people reduce their opioids, but this tends to reduce the effect of the opioid on the pain without relieving the constipation. Therefore, alternative treatment options for treating OIC are needed in clinical practice. The Committee accepted that naloxegol was a new treatment option for OIC that has not responded adequately to laxatives.\nThe technology\nProposed benefits of the technology\nHow innovative is the technology in its potential to make a significant and substantial impact on health‑related benefits?\nThe Committee considered that the pegylation of naloxegol (which prevents it from crossing the blood‑brain barrier) provides advantages; however, there were no additional gains in health‑related quality of life over those already included in the QALY calculations.\nWhat is the position of the treatment in the pathway of care for the condition?\nThe Committee heard that naloxegol would be an alternative to methylnaltrexone and would be similarly positioned in the treatment pathway after treatment with a stimulant and osmotic laxative had failed.\nAdverse reactions\nThe most frequently reported adverse events were gastrointestinal in nature (predominantly diarrhoea, abdominal pain, nausea and flatulence); this is to be expected, considering the nature of OIC and naloxegol's pharmacological mechanism of action.\nEvidence for clinical effectiveness\nAvailability, nature and quality of evidence\nThe Committee noted that the clinical evidence in the company's submission came from the KODIAC 4 and 5 trials, which compared naloxegol with placebo in people with OIC, and from a mixed treatment comparison of naloxegol, methylnaltrexone and naloxone‑oxycodone.\nRelevance to general clinical practice in the NHS\nThe Committee heard from the clinical experts that the efficacy of naloxegol was not expected to be affected by age or weight, and concluded that the KODIAC 4 and 5 trials could be generalised to the population seen in clinical practice in England.\nHaving heard from the clinical experts that naloxegol was likely to be effective in people with cancer and considering that the marketing authorisation did not exclude people with cancer, the Committee was persuaded that naloxegol would be equally effective in people with cancer pain. It concluded that its decision regarding the use of naloxegol in clinical practice would also apply to people with cancer pain.\nUncertainties generated by the evidence\nThe Committee considered that using 2 different populations introduced uncertainty in the company's mixed treatment analyses. It also recognised that none of the results from the mixed treatment comparison of naloxegol compared with active treatments were statistically significant.\nAre there any clinically relevant subgroups for which there is evidence of differential effectiveness?\nn/a\nEstimate of the size of the clinical effectiveness including strength of supporting evidence\nThe Committee concluded that naloxegol was effective compared with placebo in treating OIC that has not responded adequately to laxatives, but that there was insufficient evidence that naloxegol's clinical effectiveness differed from that of methylnaltrexone and naloxone‑oxycodone.\nEvidence for cost effectiveness\nAvailability and nature of evidence\nThe Committee concluded that although the company's model had some limitations, particularly because health state‑specific utilities were used for these comparisons rather than treatment‑specific utilities, overall it was an acceptable option for modelling treatment in this population.\nThe Committee stated that it would have preferred to see a fully incremental analysis as described in the guide to the methods of technology appraisals but, in its absence, concluded that the ICERs presented in the pairwise analyses were sufficient evidence on which to base its decisions.\nUncertainties around and plausibility of assumptions and inputs in the economic model\nThe Committee heard from the ERG that it would have been more appropriate to use health state‑dependent utility values only, rather than assuming different utilities for the treatment arms. The Committee understood from the ERG that the non‑OIC (on treatment) state in the model was too broad, that is the model structure included a heterogeneous group of patients with different number of SBMs during the same period, and that applying a single utility value to that health state would not accurately reflect patient experience in that state. The Committee understood from the ERG that although the model should have included more discrete health states reflective of the typical experience of a person with OIC, taking this approach may not necessarily have changed the model results.\nIncorporation of health‑related quality‑of‑life benefits and utility values\nHave any potential significant and substantial health‑related benefits been identified that were not included in the economic model, and how have they been considered?\nThe Committee heard from the ERG that it would have been more appropriate to use health state‑dependent utility values only, rather than assuming different utilities for the treatment arms. The Committee understood from the ERG that although the model should have included more discrete health states reflective of the typical experience of a person with OIC, taking this approach may not necessarily have changed the model results.\nThe Committee considered whether naloxegol could be considered innovative in its potential to make a substantial effect on health‑related benefits for people with opioid‑induced constipation and whether it could be considered a step‑change in the management of opioid‑induced constipation. It noted that naloxone has been in use for many years and that the only innovation it could discern was the attachment of a polyethylene glycol molecule to naloxone in order to prevent it from crossing the blood‑brain barrier. The Committee considered that the pegylation of naloxegol (provides advantages; however, there were no additional gains in health‑related quality of life over those already included in the QALY calculations.\nAre there specific groups of people for whom the technology is particularly cost effective?\nNot applicable.\nWhat are the key drivers of cost effectiveness?\nThe health‑state utility was a key driver of cost effectiveness because of the way the model was structured, in that the non‑OIC (on treatment) state was broad, that is, it included a heterogeneous group of patients with different number of SBMs during the same period, and that applying a single utility value to that health state would not accurately reflect patient experience in that state.\nMost likely cost‑effectiveness estimate (given as an ICER)\nThe Committee noted that the company's base‑case results and most of the ERG's exploratory analyses for naloxegol compared with placebo (with bisacodyl) resulted in ICERs up to £13,000 per QALY gained. In addition, naloxegol dominated (that is, was both more effective and less costly) methylnaltrexone and naloxone‑oxycodone in almost every scenario except when naloxegol was given with oxycodone compared with naloxone‑oxycodone (which produced an ICER of £34,100 per QALY gained), but as naloxone‑oxycodone is rarely used in England, this ICER was not central to the Committee's decision making.\nThe Committee concluded that in light of the robustness of the company's model, the ICERs being mostly below £20,000 per QALY gained for the comparison of naloxegol plus bisacodyl with placebo plus bisacodyl, and naloxegol mostly dominating methylnaltrexone and naloxone‑oxycodone, naloxegol was considered a cost‑effective use of NHS resources. The Committee therefore recommended naloxegol as an option within its marketing authorisation for people with OIC that has not responded adequately to laxatives.\nAdditional factors taken into account\nEqualities considerations and social value judgements\nNo equality issues were raised during the committee meeting.\nn/a# Review of guidance\nThe guidance on this technology will be considered for review 3 years after publication of the guidance.

{"guideline_text": "Nurse practitioner\n\n# Overview\nA nurse practitioner is a registered nurse who has completed specific advanced nursing education (generally a master's degree) and training in the diagnosis and management of common medical conditions. Nurse practitioners provide a broad range of health care services.\nNurse Practitioners (NPs) provide much of the same care provided by physicians generally of the type seen in their specific practice areas like family practice offices, urgent care centers, and rural health clinics, and maintain collaborative working relationships with physicians. NPs are licensed by the state in which they practice, and have a board certification (often through ANCC - American Nurses Credentialing Center or for specialty practice such as the NCC: National Certification Corporation) in their area of practice. Rather than a generic focus of education, Nurse Practitioners specialize in such areas as pediatrics, geriatrics, family, psychiatry and acute care.\nNurse practitioners treat both acute and chronic conditions through prescribing medications, physical therapy, ordering tests and therapies for patients. Many NPs have a DEA registration number that allows them to write for federally defined \"controlled\" medications.  Nurse practitioners may also bill Medicare, Medicaid and private insurance for services performed. An NP can serve as a patient’s \"point of entry\" health care provider and see patients of all ages depending on their designated scope of practice. The core philosophy of the field is individualized care. Nurse practitioners focus on patients' conditions as well as the effects of illness on the lives of the patients and their families.  Informing patients about their health care and encouraging them to participate in decisions are central to the care provided by NPs.\nIn eight states, including Oregon, Washington DC, Washington state, New Hampshire, and many Mountain/Pacific Time Zone states NPs work totally autonomously, and many choose to open their own clinical practices.  American NPs, according to the American College of Nurse Practitioners, are required in 28 states to practice in collaboration with and under the supervision of a physician though they may prescribe medications in all U.S. states, commonwealths, districts, and territories; and carry a DEA number in most states.\n\n# Scope of practice\nBecause the profession is state regulated, care provided by NPs varies. A nurse practitioner's duties may include the following:\n- Diagnosing, treating, evaluating and managing non-life-threatening acute and chronic illness and disease (e.g. diabetes, high blood pressure)\n- Obtaining medical histories and conducting physical examinations\n- Ordering, performing, and interpreting basic diagnostic studies (e.g., routine lab tests, bone x-rays, EKGs)\n- Prescribing medications (limited)\n- Prescribing physical therapy and other rehabilitation treatments\n- Providing prenatal care and family planning services\n- Providing well-child care, including screening and immunizations\n- Providing primary and specialty care services, health-maintenance care for adults, including annual physicals\n- Providing care for patients in acute and critical care settings\n- Performing minor surgeries and procedures (with additional training and usually under supervision) (e.g., dermatological biopsies, suturing, casting)\n- Collaborating with physicians and other health professionals as needed, including providing referrals\n- Counseling and educating patients on health behaviors, self-care skills, and treatment options\n- Some NPs are formally trained for surgical First Assistants in the OR.\n\n# Practice settings\nNPs practice in all states. The institutions in which they work include the following:\n- Community clinics and nurse-managed health centers\n- Health departments\n- Health maintenance organizations (HMOs)\n- Home health care agencies\n- Hospitals and hospital clinics including ER, Urgent Care, wards, and intensive care units\n- Hospice centers\n- Nurse practitioner offices\n- Nursing homes\n- Nursing schools\n- Physician offices\n- Public health departments\n- School/college clinics\n- Veterans Administration facilities\n- Walk-In Clinics\n\n# Education, licensure, and board certification\nNPs are specialize in a particular field of medical care.\nTo be licensed as a nurse practitioner, the candidate must first complete the education and training necessary to be a registered nurse (RN).\nRequirements for a registered nurse (RN) include either an associate degree in nursing (ADN), a Bachelor of Science degree in nursing (BSN), or completion of a diploma program, as well as direct patient care for acutely or chronically ill patients. Associate degree in nursing programs, which are offered by community and junior colleges, usually take 2 years. BSN programs are offered by colleges and universities and take 4 years.\nIn most states a master's degree is required. To become NPs, nurses with an ADN or diploma must first complete a bachelor's degree or enter in various programs offering an ADN to master's degree via a \"bridge program,\" most of which award the bachelor's degree while completing the requirements for the master's.\nOnce registered nurse status is attained, the candidate must complete a state-approved advanced nursing education program that usually specializes in a field such as family practice, adult health, acute care or women's health. The degree can be granted by:\n- A university, which grants a master's of science in nursing (MSN) degree which is now the minimum degree required\n- A university, which grants a doctorate in nursing\nThe variety of educational paths for NPs is a result of the history of the field. In 1965, the profession of nurse practitioner was instituted and required a master's degree. In the late 1960s into the 1970s, predictions of a physician shortage increased funding and attendance in nurse practitioner programs. During the 1970s, the NP requirements relaxed to include continuing education programs, which helped accommodate the demand for NPs. The certifying organizations, states, and employers require a minimum of a master's degree for new NPs (already established NPs with lesser education were grandfathered in).\nAfter completing the education program, the candidate must be licensed by the state in which he or she plans to practice. The State Boards of Nursing regulate nurse practitioners and each state has its own licensing and certification criteria. In general, the criteria include completion of a master's degree in nursing and certification by an accrediting body (AANC, AANP). The license period varies by state; some require biennial relicensing, others require triennial.\nBefore or after receiving state licensing, a nurse practitioner can apply for national certification from one of several professional nursing organizations such as the American Nurses Credentialing Center (ANCC) or the American Academy of Nurse Practitioners (AANP).  Contrary to popular belief, the American Nurses Association (ANA) does not offer certification, but is linked with the ANCC.  Some NPs pursue certification in a specialty. Several organizations oversee certification, including the following:\n- American Association of Critical-Care Nurses\n- American Psychiatric Nursing Association\n- Board of Certification for Emergency Nursing\n- National Certification Board of Pediatric Nurse Practitioners and Nurses\n- National Certification Corporation for the Obstetric, Gynecologic, and Neonatal Nursing Specialties\n- Oncology Nursing Certification Corporation\n- American Holistic Nurses Association\n\n# Post-nominal initials\nPost-nominal initials NPs may use include:\n- NP-C (nurse practitioner - certified; if certified by the AANP),\n- APRN, BC (advanced Practice Registered Nurse, Board Certified; if certified by the ANCC)\n- CNP (certified nurse practitioner)\n- ACNP-C (Acute Care Nurse Practitioner, Certified)()\n- CPNP (pediatric NP when certified by the pediatric nursing certification board (PNCB)\n- CRNA (Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetist)\n- CRNP (certified registered nurse practitioner) used primarily in Pennsylvania ()\n- MSN (master of science in nursing)\n- MN (master of nursing)\n- RN (registered nurse)\n- FAAN (Fellow of the American Academy of Nursing (AAN)\n- FAANP (Fellow of the American Academy of Nurse Practitioners (AANP)\n- CDE (certified diabetic educator)\n- ND (nursing doctorate)\n- DNP (doctor of nursing practice)\n- DrNP (clinical doctorate in nursing)\n- Initials of the NP's specialty may also follow their name:\nACNP (Acute care NP)\nAPN (Advance Practice Nurse)\nAHN (holistic NP)\nANP (adult NP)\nENP (emergency NP )\nFNP (family NP)\nGNP (geriatric NP)\nNNP (neonatal NP)\nPMHNP (Psychiatric and mental health Nurse Practitioner)\nNPP (Nurse Practitioner in Psychiatry)\nPNP (pediatric NP)\nWHNP (women's health NP)\nCNM (certified nurse midwife)\nBC, PCM (board certified, palliative care management)\nRN(EP) - RN (Extended Practice), Manitoba, Canada\n- ACNP (Acute care NP)\n- APN (Advance Practice Nurse)\n- AHN (holistic NP)\n- ANP (adult NP)\n- ENP (emergency NP )\n- FNP (family NP)\n- GNP (geriatric NP)\n- NNP (neonatal NP)\n- PMHNP (Psychiatric and mental health Nurse Practitioner)\n- NPP (Nurse Practitioner in Psychiatry)\n- PNP (pediatric NP)\n- WHNP (women's health NP)\n- CNM (certified nurse midwife)\n- BC, PCM (board certified, palliative care management)\n- RN(EP) - RN (Extended Practice), Manitoba, Canada", "source": "wikidoc", "question": "According to authoritative guidelines (the provided wikidoc recommendation on nurse practitioners), discuss how the scope of practice, prescriptive authority (including controlled substances), and requirements for independent practice vary across jurisdictions, and outline the key educational, certification, and licensure steps a registered nurse must complete to become a practicing nurse practitioner, including implications for clinical roles and settings."}
{"guideline_text": "Intraocular pressure\nSynonyms and keywords: IOP\n\n# Overview\nIntraocular pressure (IOP) is the fluid pressure inside the eye. Tonometry is the method eye care professionals use to determine this. IOP is an important aspect in the evaluation of patients at risk from glaucoma. Most tonometers are calibrated to measure pressure in millimeters of mercury (mmHg).\n\n# Physiology\nIntraocular pressure is mainly determined by the coupling of the production of aqueous humor and the drainage of aqueous humor mainly through the trabecular meshwork located in the anterior chamber angle.\nAn important quantitative relationship is provided below:\nWhere F = aqueous fluid formation rate, C = outflow rate, PV = episcleral venous pressure.\nThe above factors are those that drive IOP.\n\n# Measurement\nIntraocular pressure is measured with a tonometer as part of a comprehensive eye examination.\nMeasured values of intraocular pressure are influenced by corneal thickness and rigidity. As a result, some forms of refractive surgery (such as photorefractive keratectomy) can cause traditional intraocular pressure measurements to appear normal when in fact the pressure may be abnormally high.\n\n# Classification\nCurrent consensus among ophthalmologists and optometrists define normal intraocular pressure as that between 10 mmHg and 20 mmHg. The average value of intraocular pressure is 15.5 mmHg with fluctuations of about 2.75 mmHg.\nOcular hypertension (OHT) is defined by intraocular pressure being higher than normal, in the absence of optic nerve damage or visual field loss.\nHypotony, or ocular hypotony, is typically defined as intraocular pressure equal to or less than 5 mmHg. Such low intraocular pressure could indicate fluid leakage and deflation of the eyeball.\n\n# Influencing factors\n\n## Daily variation\nIntraocular pressure varies throughout the night and day. The diurnal variation for normal eyes is between 3 and 6 mmHg and the variation may increase in glaucomatous eyes. During the night, intraocular pressure may not decrease  despite the slower production of aqueous humour. In the general population, IOP ranges between 10 and 21 mm Hg with a mean of about 15 or 16 mm Hg (plus or minus 3.5 mm Hg during a 24-hour cycle).\n\n## Fitness and exercise\nThere is some inconclusive research that indicates that exercise could possibly affect IOP (some positively and some negatively). However, some other forms of exercise may raise IOP.\n\n## Musical instruments\nPlaying some musical wind instruments has been linked to increases in intraocular pressure. One 2011 study focused on brass and woodwind instruments observed \"temporary and sometimes dramatic elevations and fluctuations in IOP\".\nAnother study found that the magnitude of increase in intraocular pressure correlates with the intraoral resistance associated with the instrument, and linked intermittent elevation of intraocular pressure from playing high-resistance wind instruments to incidence of visual field loss.\nThe range of intraoral pressure involved in various classes of ethnic wind instruments, such as Native American flutes, has been shown to be generally lower than Western classical wind instruments.\n\n## Other factors\nIntraocular pressure also varies with a number of other factors such as heart rate, respiration, fluid intake, systemic medication and topical drugs. Alcohol consumption leads to a transient decrease in intraocular pressure and caffeine may increase intraocular pressure.\nTaken orally, glycerol (often mixed with fruit juice to reduce its sweet taste) can cause a rapid, temporary decrease in intraocular pressure.  This can be a useful initial emergency treatment of severely elevated pressure.\n\n# Significance\nOcular hypertension is the most important risk factor for glaucoma.\nIntraocular pressure has been measured as a secondary outcome in a systematic review comparing the effect of neuroprotective agents in slowing the progression of open angle glaucoma.\nDifferences in pressure between the two eyes is often clinically significant, and potentially associated with certain types of glaucoma, as well as  iritis or retinal detachment.\nIntraocular pressure may become elevated due to anatomical problems, inflammation of the eye, genetic factors, or as a side-effect from medication. Intraocular pressure usually increases with age and is genetically influenced.", "source": "wikidoc", "question": "According to an authoritative guideline, discuss how clinicians should measure, interpret, and act on intraocular pressure (IOP) readings in adults — including appropriate use and limitations of tonometry (eg, effects of corneal thickness and prior refractive surgery), the defined thresholds for normal IOP, ocular hypertension and hypotony, the impact of diurnal variation and other influencing factors, the clinical significance of inter‑eye pressure differences, and immediate management considerations for severely elevated IOP."}

{"guideline_text": "Practice recommendations for lung cancer radiotherapy during the COVID-19 pandemic: An ESTRO-ASTRO consensus statement\n\n\n\n## A b s t r a c t\nBackground: The COVID-19 pandemic has caused radiotherapy resource pressures and led to increased risks for lung cancer patients and healthcare staff. An international group of experts in lung cancer radiotherapy established this practice recommendation pertaining to whether and how to adapt radiotherapy for lung cancer in the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: For this ESTRO & ASTRO endorsed project, 32 experts in lung cancer radiotherapy contributed to a modified Delphi consensus process. We assessed potential adaptations of radiotherapy in two pandemic scenarios. The first, an early pandemic scenario of risk mitigation, is characterized by an altered risk-benefit ratio of radiotherapy for lung cancer patients due to their increased susceptibility for severe COVID-19 infection, and minimization of patient travelling and exposure of radiotherapy staff. The second, a later pandemic scenario, is characterized by reduced radiotherapy resources requiring patient triage. Six common lung cancer cases were assessed for both scenarios: peripherally located stage I NSCLC, locally advanced NSCLC, postoperative radiotherapy after resection of pN2 NSCLC, thoracic radiotherapy and prophylactic cranial irradiation for limited stage SCLC and palliative thoracic radiotherapy for stage IV NSCLC. Results: In a risk-mitigation pandemic scenario, efforts should be made not to compromise the prognosis of lung cancer patients by departing from guideline-recommended radiotherapy practice. In that same scenario, postponement or interruption of radiotherapy treatment of COVID-19 positive patients is https://doi.org/10.1016/j.radonc.2020.04.001 0167-8140/Ó 2020 The Author(s).

In a severe pandemic scenario characterized by reduced resources, if patients must be triaged, important factors for triage include potential for cure, relative benefit of radiation, life expectancy, and performance status. Case-specific consensus recommendations regarding multimodality treatment strategies and fractionation of radiotherapy are provided. Conclusion: This joint ESTRO-ASTRO practice recommendation established pragmatic and balanced consensus recommendations in common clinical scenarios of radiotherapy for lung cancer in order to address the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. After the outbreak of the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 [bib_ref] Early transmission dynamics in Wuhan, China, of novel coronavirusinfected pneumonia, Li [/bib_ref] , the disease rapidly became a global pandemic. Infection rates peaked and began to decline in some Asian countries by March 2020, but Europe and the US are now among the most affected regions [bib_ref] Facing Covid-19 in Italy -Ethics, Logistics, and Therapeutics on the Epidemic's Front..., Rosenbaum [/bib_ref]. Most COVID-19 infections are characterized by only mild symptoms of fever and cough; however, there is a high risk of severe pulmonary infection and death, in particular for the elderly and populations with comorbidities such as diabetes, hypertension and cardiopulmonary diseases [bib_ref] Clinical Characteristics of Coronavirus Disease 2019 in China, Guan [/bib_ref]. Cancer patients have been reported to be at increased risk of mortality [bib_ref] Risk of COVID-19 for cancer patients, Xia [/bib_ref]. Therefore, many countries have implemented strategies to reduce the risk of spread, aiming to slow-down or ''flatten\" the infection rate of the coronavirus and to stay within the capacity of the healthcare services, especially intensive care units.\nThe pandemic mitigation strategies of most countries also apply to medical care in general and to oncology in particular, and include reduction of elective services, a focus on remote visits (e.g. telemedicine and video), and use of personal protective equipment. However, most health authorities maintain emergency services (e.g. for accidents) and services for diagnosis and treatment of severe diseases such as cancer. These dramatic developments related to COVID-19 are associated with challenges for the practice of radiation oncology [bib_ref] COVID-19 outbreak in northern Italy: first practical indications for radiotherapy departments, Filippi [/bib_ref] [bib_ref] Running a Radiation Oncology Department at the time of coronavirus: an Italian..., Krengli [/bib_ref] , especially for radiotherapy of lung cancer patients, who represent one of the highest-risk groups, with high risks of death from both cancer and COVID-19 illness.\nIt may be challenging for radiation oncologists to continue to follow accepted practice guidelines, given these limitations, and delivering standard therapies may even become inappropriate. There are two potential scenarios that may unfold, with different radiation practice patterns [bib_ref] Individualized treatment recommendations for lung cancer patients at different stages of treatment..., Zhao [/bib_ref].\nIn a first (early) pandemic scenario, sufficient resources are still available to deliver radiation or multimodality treatment. This is sometimes referred to as the ''contingency standard of care\". However, suppression strategies aiming to slow down the virus spread may also impact the practice of lung cancer radiotherapy due to: a) the need for suppression of the coronavirus and, therefore, the need to minimize the travel of patientsand exposure of our radiotherapy staff [bib_ref] COVID-19: protecting health-care workers, Lancet [/bib_ref] ; b) an altered risk-benefit ratio of radiotherapy for lung cancer patients due to their increased susceptibility for severe COVID-19 infection when repeatedly leaving their home and traveling to radiotherapy treatment and simultaneously being treated with thoracic radiotherapy. For example, a patient who contracts COVID-19 during a visit for radiation is at a high risk of morbidity and death due to that visit. In this scenario of the COVID-19 pandemic, standard-of-care practice of curative or palliative radiotherapy for lung cancer might require adaptations and lead to treatment recommendations that are outside current guidelines [bib_ref] Managing COVID-19 in the oncology clinic and avoiding the distraction effect, Francesco [/bib_ref].\nIn a second (later) pandemic scenario, radiotherapy resources may not be available in sufficient quantity for treatment of all patients. A severe shortage of radiotherapy resources may result from sickness or home-quarantine of our department staffing. Service or repair of radiotherapy software and hardware might be restricted or unavailable by radiotherapy vendors. These issues would require the allocation of resources and triage of patients [bib_ref] Fair allocation of scarce medical resources in the time of Covid-19, Emanuel [/bib_ref] , in addition to the potential need to make changes to lung cancer radiotherapy prescriptions. This phase is sometimes referred to as the ''crisis standard of care\".\nIn this setting of the COVID-19 pandemic, hypofractionation is an attractive treatment option, one that is actively being discussed within the radiotherapy community on social media platforms such as Twitter and theMednet. However, the results of such ad hoc discussions do not address the needs of our radiotherapy community in an optimal way. Individual opinions may not be clinically appropriate and might expose cancer patients to potential harm from suboptimal radiotherapy practice. On the other end of the spectrum, adoption of appropriate hypofractionation might be low if that practice is outside of international guidelines and not endorsed by recognized experts and professional societies, yet such guidelines often take many months to develop.\nIn this practice recommendation, which is endorsed by the European Society for Radiotherapy and Oncology (ESTRO) and the American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO), an international group of experts in lung cancer radiotherapy aims to rapidly provide guidance about the potential need to adapt the practice and fractionation of radiotherapy for lung cancer in the current COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n# Methods\nOn March 22nd, 32 experts in lung cancer radiotherapy were invited to participate in this project, 16 European and 16 US/Canadian experts. By March 24th, 97% had agreed, and a replacement was found for the single invitee who was unavailable, to keep the total at 32 with a balance between groups. All invited participants are co-authors of recent national and international lung cancer practice guidelines or principal investigators of lung cancer clinical trials. A modified Delphi process was used to establish consensus about whether and how to adapt radiotherapy for lung cancer in the COVID-19 pandemic. Surveys were circulated to all individual participants using the online survey tool SurveyMonkey. All respondents agreed to participate in a rapid Delphi process, with 24 h to complete each round and successive rounds starting 24 h after the closure of the previous round.\nTwo scenarios of the COVID-19 pandemic were assessed, both of which were already occurring in some geographical regions: d Early pandemic scenario 1 -risk mitigation: In this scenario, we asked if respondents would recommend changes to standard practice during the early phase, considering these challenges:\nThe altered risk-benefit ratio of radiotherapy for lung cancer patients due to their increased susceptibility for severe COVID-19 infection, and minimization of patient traveling and exposure of our radiotherapy staff.\nd Later pandemic scenario 2 -reduced radiotherapy resources: In this scenario, we asked respondents to consider how their above recommendations from scenario 1 would change if a lack of radiotherapy resources prevented some patients at their centre from receiving radiation treatment.\nSix common lung cancer cases were assessed for both pandemic scenarios . For all six, we assumed a patient with average / standard characteristics for the lung cancer population. The standard treatment for each case was provided, consistent with guideline-recommended radiotherapy according to current versions of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN), ESTRO, ASTRO and European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) guidelines.\nThe questions for the first round of the Delphi process are shown in . All responses were analyzed and consolidated by two investigators (MG and DAP). A threshold of 66% for agreement or disagreement was required for each item to reach consensus and a threshold of 80% for strong consensus. For questions voting on prioritizing the cases, the results of the vote are presented without necessarily achieving consensus. In the second and third rounds, participants received the results and summary of comments from prior rounds, and were asked to vote again on items that had not reached 66% agreement. New questions were constructed (by MG and DAP) in order to gain clarification or to raise issues noted in the comments from participants. Following the third round, any items still lacking consensus were not considered a recommendation, but some important issues raised by a large minority of respondents are reflected below.\n\n# Results\nA total of three Delphi rounds were conducted. Surveys remained open for 24 h and response rates were 29/32 (March 23rd, round 1), 31/32 (March 25th, round 2) and 30/32 (March 27th, round 3).\nEarly phase of the COVID-19 pandemic: risk mitigation Question: Would you recommend postponing the initiation of treatment by 4-6 weeks?\nIn the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, decisions on delay of treatment depended on the clinical case [fig_ref] Table 3: Recommendations regarding postponement of treatment [/fig_ref]. There Questions in the first round of the Delphi process.\nEarly pandemic scenario 1 -risk mitigation\n\n## All cases\nDo you recommend that physicians change their radiotherapy practice to address the challenges in this early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic? (i.e. risks due to multiple visits, susceptibility of lung cancer patients to COVID-19 morbidity/mortality) All cases Would you recommend postponing the initiation of treatment by 4-6 weeks? All cases Would you recommend hypofractionating beyond your usual fractionation? Case 1-3\nWould your answers to questions #2 and #3 above change if the tumor was mutation positive (EGFR or ALK) or PD-L1 positive (i.e. >50%)? Please rank the six cases in order of priority, starting with the highest-priority case, in the setting of reduced resources Overall\nIf you were to triage patients for treatment, in the setting of reduced RT resources, please provide up to 5 factors that you would use to decide who gets treatment, in order of importance The six lung cancer cases described, including the diagnosis and the presumed standard guideline-recommended therapy. , answers on postponement were balanced and we asked for factors influencing the decision whether or not to postpone. There was strong consensus that tumor growth rate (87%) should be used in the decision-making process and some support for these other factors (33-66%): patient preference, solid component vs GGO, patient performance status, T1 vs T2, current and future status of pandemic.\nFor case 5 (PCI SCLC) we asked about regular contrast-enhanced cranial MRI follow up as an alternative to PCI: this strategy was supported by 46% without reaching consensus.\nQuestion: Would you recommend hypofractionating beyond your usual fractionation?\nIn the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, there was consensus not to universally change radiotherapy practice to more hypofractionated regimens (table 4). There was consensus or strong consensus not to change to more hypofractionated approaches in case 3 (PORT NSCLC), case 4 (LS SCLC) and case 5 (PCI SCLC). In contrast, there was strong consensus to change to more hypofractionation in case 6 (palliative NSCLC).\nIf a decision was made for hypofractionation beyond standard fractionations, there was strong consensus for using a single fraction SBRT of 30-34 Gy in case 1 (stage I NSCLC). In case 6 (palliative NSCLC), palliative regimens in 5 fractions, 2 fractions and a 1 fraction all had similar support.\nFor case 2 (stage III NSCLC), we further differentiated fractionations based on whether the patient was treated with radiotherapy only, with sequential radiochemotherapy or concomitant radiochemotherapy. There was strong consensus that hypofractionated radiotherapy is appropriate in radiotherapy alone or sequential radiochemotherapy; however, there was consensus against hypofractionation in concomitant radiochemotherapy . Various fractionations were considered as appropriate, with total doses between 50 Gy and 66 Gy delivered in 15-30 fractions.\nQuestion: An operable patient with stage I NSCLC is referred to you by a thoracic surgeon because timely access to surgery is not available due to surgical capacity issues. Would you treat with SBRT?\nSurgical capacities might become especially at risk because of the strong need for intensive care and ventilators in patients with severe COVID-19 infection. We therefore addressed a situation where an operable patient with stage I NSCLC is referred to radiation oncology by a thoracic surgeon because timely access to surgery is not available due to surgical capacity issues: it was asked whether treatment with SBRT would be offered. There was a 100% consensus to offer SBRT.\nQuestion: Which multi-modality strategies would you consider as reasonable in order to address the challenges in this early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic?\nThis question was asked for the curative stage III NSCLC (case 2) only. It was explicitly described that the patient does not have any contraindications against the guideline recommended standard-ofcare concomitant radiochemotherapy. Concurrent radiochemotherapy achieved strong consensus as the preferred treatment strategy. Radiotherapy alone, chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy followed by radiochemotherapy were not considered as reasonable treatment strategies by >33% of participants.\nWe also asked if respondents would recommend against any standard concurrent chemotherapy agents (e.g. cisplatinetoposide, cisplatin-vinka alkaloid, cisplatin-pemetrexed, carboplatin-paclitaxel, or carboplatin monotherapy), and there was no consensus to recommend against any of these. The carboplatin-paclitaxel regimen was chosen as a regimen of concern most often (by 37% of respondents), potentially due to risks of myelosuppression and/or pneumonitis.

(Cases 1-3) There was strong consensus (96%) not to change the treatment strategy for case 1 (stage I NSCLC) and almost consensus (64%) for case 3 (PORT NSCLC).\nFor case 2 (stage III NSCLC), we asked about induction strategies to postpone the start of radiotherapy for the populations described in this question, although these are not yet evidence-based treatment options. There was limited support but no consensus to consider induction EGFR-targeting TKI for EGFR mutated NSCLC or induction ALK-targeting TKI for NSCLC with ALK rearrangement (38%); induction chemo-IO for cancers highly PD-L1 positive was not supported (17%).\nFor case 3 (PORT NSCLC) we asked about EGFR/ALK targeting TKIs and about immune-checkpoint inhibition (±chemotherapy) as options to postpone radiotherapy or as alternatives to radiotherapy (although these are not yet evidence-based treatment options): none of these strategies was supported by >25% of the participants.\n\n## Question: handling of covid-19 positive patients?\nThere was consensus in all cases to postpone initiation of radiotherapy until the patient becomes asymptomatic and the test for COVID-19 becomes negative [fig_ref] Table 6: Recommendations on delay or interruption of treatment in COVID-19 positive patients [/fig_ref]. When patients are diagnosed as COVID-19 positive during radiotherapy treatment, there was consensus to interrupt radiotherapy until the patient becomes asymptomatic and the test for COVID-19 is negative in cases 3, 5 and 6 whereas opinions were evenly split for the cases with curative radiotherapy at the time of primary diagnosis (cases 1, 2 and 4).\nFor case 2 (stage III NSCLC) and case 4 (LS SCLC) with longer radiotherapy treatments, the following factors were described as relevant in the decision-making process of whether or not to interrupt radiotherapy in patients diagnosed as COVID-19 positive: COVID-19 related symptoms, symptoms of lung cancer, and infection with COVID-19 near the end of treatment.\nLater phase of the COVID-19 pandemic: lack of radiotherapy resources and need for patient triage For the later phase of the COVID-19 pandemic with potentially reduced radiotherapy resources, we addressed the questions whether further hypofractionation or postponement of radiotherapy for COVID-19 positive patients would be considered as reasonable and how to prioritize and triage patients. Results are summarized in. For case 3 (PCI SCLC) there was strong consensus (83%) for regular contrast-enhanced cranial MRI follow up instead of PCI.

[fig_ref] Table 8: Prioritization of lung cancer patients and factor for triaging of patients [/fig_ref] shows the ranking of cases based on relative priority, their perceived priority relative to all other types of cancer cases, and the top 5 factors recommended in order to triage patients in a setting where not all patients can receive radiotherapy due to capacity shortages.\n\n## Prioritization of cases and triage of patients\n\n# Discussion\nThis Delphi process was able to achieve consensus in many important aspects of lung cancer radiotherapy in the current COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 32 international experts in lung cancer radiotherapy completed 3 rounds of a consensus-building process and addressed six common lung cancer cases within the context of two different scenarios of the COVID-19 pandemic. Beyond detailed recommendations shown above, the following three take-home messages should be considered in lung cancer radiotherapy.\nFirst, in a risk-mitigation pandemic scenario where radiotherapy resources remain available, efforts should be made to not compromise the prognosis of lung cancer patients by departing from guideline-recommended radiotherapy practice. Second, in that same scenario, postponement or interruption of radiotherapy treatment of COVID-19 positive patients should be considered to avoid exposure of cancer patients and staff to an increased risk of COVID-19 infection. Third, in a severe pandemic scenario characterized by reduced resources, if patients must be triaged, important factors included potential for cure, relative benefit of radiation, life expectancy, and performance status.\nThis joint ESTRO-ASTRO practice recommendation aims to provide rapid, pragmatic and balanced guidance in common clinical scenarios of radiotherapy for lung cancer. Practitioners must use their clinical judgement when considering how these consensus statements apply to their individual clinical practice. These consensus statements are not absolute clinical practice recommendations. Clinical decisions should take into account all clinical factors, and in some settings the consensus recommendations may not be appropriate. The decision-making process will be influenced by various stakeholders (governments, health care authorities, hospital and university administration), will be restricted by logistical and financial aspects, will need to follow the appropriate legal frameworks, and will need to be put into political and cultural context. The ability to implement hypofractionation may depend on departmental resources available (e.g. physicist).\nThis ESTRO-ASTRO practice recommendation used methodologies that are established quality indicators for regular consensus and guideline processes [bib_ref] Methods for the guideline-based development of quality indicators-a systematic review, Kötter [/bib_ref] : the practice recommendation was officially endorsed by the ESTRO and ASTRO societies, a sufficiently large group of international experts in lung cancer radiotherapy contributed to this recommendation, the modified Delphi process started with open questions aiming to comprehensively collect the knowledge and opinions of all participants and consensus was established by follow-up rounds of feedback and voting. A systematic review was not part of the practice recommendation due to time constraints, and especially due to a lack of evidence for pandemic situations.\nAll co-authors therefore encourage practitioners to consider the results of this ESTRO-ASTRO practice recommendation on whether and how to adapt radiotherapy for lung cancer to the COVID-19 pandemic. Finally, we want to express our gratitude to all colleagues of all professions and disciplines who continue delivering optimal cancer care in serious situations such as now -take care of yourselves as well as your patients.\n\n## Estro disclaimer\nESTRO cannot endorse all statements or opinions made on the guidelines.

{"guideline_text": "Guidelines for telematic second opinion consultation on headaches in Europe: on behalf of the European Headache Federation (EHF)\n\nThe seeking of a second opinion is the longestablished process whereby a physician or expert from the same or a similar specialty is invited to assess a clinical case in order to confirm or reject a diagnosis or treatment plan. Seeking a second opinion has become more common in recent years, and the trend is associated with significant changes in the patient-doctor relationship. Telemedicine is attractive because it is not only fast but also affordable and thus makes it possible to reach highly qualified centres and experts that would otherwise be inaccessible, being impossible, or too expensive, to reach by any surface transport. In Europe, the European Headache Federation (EHF), being able to draw on a group of headache experts covering all the European languages, is the organisation best placed to provide qualified second-opinion consultation on difficult headache cases and to develop a Headache Medical Opinion Service Centre. The provision of good quality clinical information is crucial to the formulation of a valid, expert second opinion. This preliminary step can be properly accomplished only by the primary health care provider through the furnishing of an appropriate clinical report, together with the results of all available tests, including original films of all imaging studies already performed. On receiving the EHF's proposed standardised data collection form, properly filled in, we may be sure that we have all the relevant data necessary to formulate a valid expert second opinion. This form can be accessed electronically and downloaded from the EHF website. Once finalised, the EHF second opinion project should be treated as a pilot strategy that requires careful monitoring (for the first year at least), so that appropriate changes, as suggested by the retrospective analysis and its quality control, can be implemented.\n\n# Introduction\nThe seeking of a second opinion is the long-established process whereby an expert from the same or a similar specialty is invited to assess a clinical case in order to confirm or reject a diagnosis or treatment plan. A second opinion might be requested by the primary physician (primary health care provider, PCP), by the patient, or by the patient's relatives. It serves to reduce uncertainty and thus anxiety, and to promote a better understanding of the disease by the patient and her/his family, as well as better compliance with the treatment plan. When a second opinion confirms the initial diagnosis, it may indeed provide reassurance and help the patient to accept her/his disease.\nBy bridging an important gap between the primary physician's diagnosis and treatment plan and the patient's emotional need for expert opinion, a medical second opinion should thus help to establish a patient's medical needs and contribute to achieving optimal treatment goals.\nBecause traditional second opinion evaluations involve a face-to-face examination, they can be difficult to obtain, rather expensive and involve a delay; as a result, they tend to be carried out in very few or very special cases.\nHowever, in recent decades, advances in the field of information technology, and in telecommunications technology in particular, have led to the development of a new model of second opinion and the creation of the concept of telemedicine.\nNowadays, with access to the internet so widespread, patients and doctors are directly involved in establishing primary diagnoses and in the treatment decision-making process. Both categories actively use the internet to get information about a disease and about modern treatment options and strategies and will often actively seek second opinions from opinion leaders in the field.\nInitially, telemedicine (the use of telecommunications technology for medical diagnosis and patient care) was mainly used for getting second opinions on imaging data (e.g. radiological and neuroradiological images, online ECG, USG, etc.). However, this novel concept rapidly spread to other medical specialties: pathology, surgery, cardiology, dermatology, orthopaedics, gynaecology, urology, neurology, including neurosurgery and so on [bib_ref] WebOnCOLL enabled remote cardiology consultation for suspected myocardial infarction, Chronaki [/bib_ref] [bib_ref] Online engineering education: learning anywhere, anytime, Bourne [/bib_ref] [bib_ref] Practice guidelines and healthcare telematics: towards an alliance, Gordon [/bib_ref].\nTelemedicine [bib_ref] I2C:a system for the indexing, storage, and retrieval of medical images by..., Orphanoudakis [/bib_ref] has proved attractive because it is not only fast but also affordable and thus makes it possible to reach highly qualified centres and experts that would otherwise be inaccessible (unavailable, impossible or too expensive to reach by any surface transport) [bib_ref] WebOnCOLL enabled remote cardiology consultation for suspected myocardial infarction, Chronaki [/bib_ref] [bib_ref] I2C:a system for the indexing, storage, and retrieval of medical images by..., Orphanoudakis [/bib_ref] [bib_ref] WebOnCOLL: medical collaboration in regional healthcare networks, Chronaki [/bib_ref].\nAs a result of this trend, which is one of the reasons why second opinion seeking has become more common in recent years, the relationship between patients and doctors has changed radically: the era of the paternalistic relationship, in which patients blindly followed the advice of their doctors, is over.\n\n## The european headache federation project\nIn the field of headache medicine in Europe, the European Headache Federation (EHF), being able to draw upon the expertise of a group headache experts covering all the European languages, is the organisation best placed to provide qualified second opinion consultation on difficult headache cases. Through its development of a Headache Medical Opinion Service Centre, the EHF will provide a valuable and necessary service to the populations and health care providers of all European countries, while also accomplishing the most important of its aims: to promote headache knowledge and care in Europe [bib_ref] Headache in Europe, Gerber [/bib_ref] [bib_ref] Guidelines for the organization of headache education in Europe: the headache school;..., Antonaci [/bib_ref].\nThe provision of good quality clinical information is crucial to the formulation of a valid, expert second opinion. This preliminary step can be properly accomplished only by the PCP through the furnishing of an appropriate clinical report, together with the results of all available tests, including the original films of all imaging studies already performed.\nFurthermore, it may be better accomplished if a standard data collection form is provided in advance. To this end, several second opinion software solutions have been developed to facilitate communication and prevent the omission of important, sensitive data, while guaranteeing adequate personal data protection [bib_ref] WebOnCOLL: medical collaboration in regional healthcare networks, Chronaki [/bib_ref].\nTo the best of our knowledge, no such software programs are available for the requesting and formulation of second opinions on headache patients, even though there is a need for them in order to guarantee optimal results. When assessing a difficult case, there are certain crucial data that must always be collected. First of all, it is important to know the reason for the consultation: whether it is to confirm a diagnosis, for differential diagnosis or diagnostic work-up counselling, or for treatment advice. The need for treatment advice may arise when a patient fails to respond to a therapy or develops side effects, or it may simply stem from a desire to explore all possible and available therapeutic options in order to optimise a patient's treatment.\nThe expert should also know who is requesting the second opinion: whether it is the patient her/himself, family members and/or friends, or a doctor (i.e., the PCP). If it is the PCP, it is important to know his/her name, affiliation and contact details in case he/she needs to be contacted again in order to get more detailed clinical information.\nThe best way to provide the necessary information is through a semi-structured questionnaire. The data collection form (available as Electronic Supplementary Material) must cover a series of important aspects, as detailed in the following steps: It is also important to know the suggested clinical diagnosis (headache type or types), as formulated by the PCP, as well as the patient's other current comorbid medical conditions. Information should be given regarding current headache treatments (prescribed and over-the-counter medications) for acute and for prophylactic therapy (drugs, doses, treatment duration, response and side effects). Use/overuse of OTC drugs and/or other substance use or abuse should be reported, as should treatments used for other comorbidities [bib_ref] Guidelines for the organization of headache education in Europe: the headache school;..., Antonaci [/bib_ref].\nOn receiving this proposed standardised form, properly completed, we can be sure that all the relevant data have been provided, and a better result, in terms of a valid expert second opinion, may thus be expected [bib_ref] The action workflow approach to workflow management technology, Medina Mores [/bib_ref] [bib_ref] Cardiac event recording yields more diagnoses than 24-hour holter monitoring in patients..., Scalvini [/bib_ref]. The proposed application form can be accessed electronically and downloaded from the EHF website, automatically translated into the user's language, thereby facilitating communication [bib_ref] Guidelines for the organization of headache education in Europe: the headache school;..., Antonaci [/bib_ref] [bib_ref] The action workflow approach to workflow management technology, Medina Mores [/bib_ref] [bib_ref] Cardiac event recording yields more diagnoses than 24-hour holter monitoring in patients..., Scalvini [/bib_ref].\nThe authors of the present document can be contacted for consultations on behalf of the EHF, but other experts in the field are also welcome to compose a list of opinion leaders on the field (Board of Headache European Consultants) that can provide the requested second opinion, If possible, with the same language of the informer, with quality and safety using appropriate telecommunicating technology [bib_ref] The action workflow approach to workflow management technology, Medina Mores [/bib_ref] (i.e. telecommunication or Skype connection).\nThrough this project, the EHF will open the way for better care for patients with difficult or rare headache conditions, and also for people from remote and/or small places where health care facilities are more restricted and gaining access to a headache expert can be difficult.\nThrough modern telecommunications technology and internet teleconsultation, the EHF might thus be enabled to accomplish, on a global level, its mission to provide strong medical expert support in the field of headache.\nThe objectives the EHF aims to achieve through the implementation of this service are:\n1. Secure and fast access to patient information, wherever the patient is located, also making use of on-line dialogue methods (i.e. Skype); 2. better quality diagnosing and treatment; 3. reduced time to treatment; 4. reduced use of OTC drugs; 5. promotion of more efficient use of resources; and 6. promotion of on-line collaboration among health care professionals (across health care organisations and national borders).\nOnce finalised, the programme should be treated as a pilot strategy and be carefully monitored (for the first year at least), so that appropriate changes, as suggested by the retrospective analysis and its quality control, can be implemented.\nThe main problem this project could encounter, in the event of a large volume of requests, is that of the costs involved. It is important to estimate these, i.e., the total cost of implementing the project, as well as the costs per case. It is also essential to establish how these costs will be met (who will pay) and to secure the funds needed. The success of the project will also depend on the availability of a good programme, software and informatics with a broadly available platform.\nTherefore it is necessary to consider all the possible sources of funding, asking as to whom we should look to for the necessary grants and financial support: the EHF, the WHO, local health authorities, the pharmaceutical industry, or private companies.\nSince the EHF is a non-profit organisation, which seeks to accomplish a mission and pursues prestige rather than financial gain, this reduces the total costs of the programme and should make it possible to obtain financial support from an external sponsor.\nA further consideration is the legal question of the liability and responsibility of the consulting experts offering diagnoses and proposing treatments. The expert second opinion they provide should be presented and considered purely as advice, making it quite clear that full responsibility cannot be accepted for advice given on the basis of information provided by a primary health physician. This issue, however, needs further discussion and clarification.\nConflict of interest None.", "source": "pubmed", "question": "According to authoritative guidelines from the European Headache Federation, outline the information the primary care physician must provide when requesting a telematic second-opinion for a difficult headache case (including the rationale for the consultation, patient and requester details, clinical history, investigations and imaging, current and prior treatments, comorbidities, and language/contact considerations), and discuss how the use of the EHF’s standardised electronic data-collection form, pilot monitoring (first-year quality control), and considerations about cost and medico-legal responsibility should influence how the service is implemented and used in routine practice."}

Patients in both treatment groups were followed for safety, including bleeding events, for up to 77 days.\nPatients randomized to the betrixaban arm received betrixaban 160 mg orally on Day 1, then 80 mg once daily for 35 to 42 days AND enoxaparin subcutaneous placebo once daily for 6 to 14 days. Patients randomized to the enoxaparin arm received enoxaparin 40 mg subcutaneously once daily for 6 to 14 days AND betrixaban placebo orally once daily for 35 to 42 days.\nPatients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance ≥ 15 and < 30 mL/min) received reduced doses of study medications (betrixaban 80 mg loading dose, then 40 mg once daily or enoxaparin 20 mg once daily) along with corresponding placebo.\nPatients taking a concomitant P-gp inhibitor received betrixaban 80 mg loading dose, then 40 mg once daily or enoxaparin 40 mg subcutaneously once daily for 6 to 14 days along with corresponding placebo.\nHemorrhage\nThe most common adverse reactions with betrixaban were related to bleeding (> 5%) with major bleeding occurring in less than 1% of patients.\nOverall, 54% of patients receiving betrixaban experienced at least one adverse reaction vs. 52% with enoxaparin. The frequency of patients reporting serious adverse reactions was similar between betrixaban (18%) and enoxaparin (17%). In the APEX trial, the most frequent reason for treatment discontinuation was bleeding, with an incidence rate of 2.4% for betrixaban vs. 1.2% for enoxaparin.\nThe primary and secondary safety outcomes in APEX were bleeding-related events.\nA summary of major and clinically relevant non-major (CRNM) bleeding events in the overall safety population is shown in Table 1. Most CRNM events (86%) were mild to moderate in severity, and the majority (62%) did not require medical intervention.\nThe incidence of fatal bleeding was the same in the betrixaban and enoxaparin treatment groups (1 in each group).\nA summary of major and CRNM bleeding events by dose is shown in Table 2 and Table 3.\nThe most common adverse reactions occurring in ≥ 2% of patients are shown in Table 4.\nOther Adverse Reactions\n- Hypersensitivity reactions: one patient experienced a serious adverse reaction of moderate hypersensitivity\n\n## Postmarketing Experience\nThere is limited information regarding Betrixaban Postmarketing Experience in the drug label.\n\n# Drug Interactions\nInhibitors of P-gp\nBetrixaban is a substrate of P-gp and concomitant use of P-gp inhibitors (e.g., amiodarone, azithromycin, verapamil, ketoconazole, clarithromycin) results in an increased exposure of betrixaban.\nReduce the dose of betrixaban for patients receiving or starting concomitant P-gp inhibitors.\nAnticoagulants, Antiplatelets, and Thrombolytics\nCo-administration of anticoagulants, antiplatelet drugs, and thrombolytics may increase the risk of bleeding. Promptly evaluate any signs or symptoms of blood loss if patients are treated concomitantly with anticoagulants, aspirin, other platelet aggregation inhibitors, and/or NSAIDs.\n\n# Use in Specific Populations\n\n### Pregnancy\nPregnancy Category (FDA): \nRisk Summary\nThere are no data with the use of betrixaban in pregnant women, but treatment is likely to increase the risk of hemorrhage during pregnancy and delivery. Betrixaban was studied in reproductive and developmental toxicology studies in rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis at exposures up to 44 times the recommended clinical dose of 80 mg daily. Although betrixaban was not associated with adverse developmental fetal outcomes in animals, maternal toxicity (i.e., hemorrhage) was identified in these studies. Betrixaban should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk to the mother and fetus.\nAdverse outcomes in pregnancy occur regardless of the health of the mother or the use of medications. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively.\nData\nAnimal Data\nEmbryo-fetal development studies were conducted in pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis. In rats, no adverse embryofetal or teratogenic effects were seen when betrixaban was administered orally at doses up to 200 mg/kg/day, or 44 times the human dose of 80 mg/day when based on AUC. In rabbits, no adverse embryofetal or teratogenic effects were seen at doses up to 45 mg/kg/day, or 35 times the human exposure at a dose of 80 mg/day when based on AUC. Pregnant rabbits administered the highest dose of 150 mg/kg/day were terminated prematurely due to excessive maternal toxicities. Upon post-mortem examination, early and/or late resorptions and fetal deaths were observed at the 150 mg/kg dose, which may be linked to hemorrhage observed in various organs including the reproductive tract.\nIn a rat pre-and-post-natal developmental study, betrixaban was administered orally during the period of organogenesis and through lactation day 20 at doses up to 200 mg/kg/day. Maternal toxicities (including decreased body weight gain and food consumption and red/brown perivaginal substance) were observed at 200 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 44 times the human exposure when based on AUC. At a maternal dose up to 200 mg/kg/day, betrixaban did not have adverse effects on sexual maturation, reproductive performance, and behavioral development of the F1 generation.\nClinical Considerations\nMaternal Adverse Reactions\nTreatment is likely to increase the risk of hemorrhage during pregnancy and delivery. Consider the risks of bleeding and of stroke in using betrixaban in this setting.\nPregnancy Category (AUS): \nThere is no Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) guidance on usage of Betrixaban in women who are pregnant.\n\n### Labor and Delivery\nThere is no FDA guidance on use of Betrixaban during labor and delivery.\n\n### Nursing Mothers\nRisk Summary\nNo data are available regarding the presence of betrixaban or its metabolites in human milk, the effects of the drug on the breast-fed infant, or the effects of the drug on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for betrixaban and any potential adverse effects on the breast-fed child from betrixaban or from the underlying maternal condition.\n\n### Pediatric Use\nSafety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.\n\n### Geriatic Use\nOf the total number of patients in the APEX clinical study 90% were 65 years and over, while 68.6% were greater than or equal to 75 years. No clinically significant differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between older and younger patients.\n\n### Gender\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Betrixaban with respect to specific gender populations.\n\n### Race\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Betrixaban with respect to specific racial populations.\n\n### Renal Impairment\nPatients with severe renal impairment (CrCl ≥ 15 to  30 mL/min, computed by Cockcroft-Gault using actual body weight).\n\n### Hepatic Impairment\nBetrixaban has not been evaluated in patients with hepatic impairment, because these patients may have intrinsic coagulation abnormalities. Therefore, the use of betrixaban is not recommended in patients with hepatic impairment.\n\n### Females of Reproductive Potential and Males\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Betrixaban in women of reproductive potentials and males.\n\n### Immunocompromised Patients\nThere is no FDA guidance one the use of Betrixaban in patients who are immunocompromised.\n\n# Administration and Monitoring\n\n### Administration\nThe recommended duration of treatment is 35 to 42 days.\n\n### Monitoring\nThere is limited information regarding Betrixaban Monitoring in the drug label.\n\n# IV Compatibility\nThere is limited information regarding the compatibility of Betrixaban and IV administrations.\n\n# Overdosage\nOverdose of betrixaban increases the risk of bleeding.\nA specific reversal agent for betrixaban is not available. There is no experience with hemodialysis in individuals receiving betrixaban. Protamine sulfate, vitamin K, and tranexamic acid are not expected to reverse the anticoagulant activity of betrixaban.\n\n# Pharmacology\n\n## Mechanism of Action\nBetrixaban is an oral FXa inhibitor that selectively blocks the active site of FXa and does not require a cofactor (such as Anti-thrombin III) for activity. Betrixaban inhibits free FXa and prothrombinase activity. By directly inhibiting FXa, betrixaban decreases thrombin generation (TG). Betrixaban has no direct effect on platelet aggregation.\n\n## Structure\nBetrixaban, a factor Xa (FXa) inhibitor, is chemically described as N-(5-chloropyridin-2-yl)-2--5-methoxybenzamide maleate. Its molecular formula (as maleate salt) is C27H26ClN5O7, which corresponds to a molecular weight of 567.98. Betrixaban (maleate salt) has the following structural formula:\n\n## Pharmacodynamics\nInhibition of FXa by betrixaban results in an inhibition of thrombin generation at clinically relevant concentrations, and the maximum inhibition of thrombin generation coincides with the time of peak betrixaban concentrations.\nCardiac Electrophysiology\nIn a study that evaluated the effect of betrixaban on the QT interval, a concentration-dependent increase in the QTc interval was observed. Based on the observed concentration-QTc relationship a mean (upper 95% CI) QTc prolongation of 4 ms (5 ms) is predicted for 80 mg betrixaban and 13 ms (16 ms) for a 4.7-fold increase in exposure.\n\n## Pharmacokinetics\nWithin the anticipated therapeutic dose range, a two-fold increase in dose resulted in a three-fold increase in exposure in the single ascending dose study. A two-fold increase in betrixaban exposure was observed after repeat dosing, and the time to steady-state is 6 days (without an initial loading dose).\nAbsorption\nThe oral bioavailability of betrixaban for an 80 mg dose is 34%, and peak concentrations occurred within 3 to 4 hours. Betrixaban is also a substrate of P-gp.\nEffect of Food\nWhen administered with a low-fat (900 calories, 20% fat) or high-fat (900 calories, 60% fat) meal, Cmax and AUC were reduced as compared to the fasting state by an average of 70% and 61% for low-fat and 50% and 48% for high-fat, respectively. The effect of food on betrixaban PK could be observed for up to 6 hours after meal intake.\nDistribution\nThe apparent volume of distribution is 32 L/kg. In vitro plasma protein binding is 60%.\nElimination\nThe effective half-life of betrixaban is 19 to 27 hours.\nMetabolism\nUnchanged betrixaban is the predominant component found in human plasma. Two inactive major metabolites formed by CYP-independent hydrolysis comprise the other components in plasma, accounting for 15 to 18% of the circulating drug-related material. Less than 1% of the minor metabolites could be formed via metabolism by the following CYP enzymes; CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4.\nExcretion\nFollowing oral administration of radio-labeled betrixaban approximately 85% of the administered compound was recovered in the feces and 11% recovered in the urine. In a study of intravenous betrixaban, a median value of 17.8% of the absorbed dose was observed as unchanged betrixaban in urine.\nSpecific Populations\nMale and Female Patients\nNo clinically significant changes in betrixaban pharmacokinetics were observed between males and females.\nPatients with Renal Impairment\nIn a dedicated renal impairment study mean AUC0-24 on day 8 was increased by 1.89, 2.27 and 2.63-fold in mild (eGFRMDRD ≥ 60 to < 90 mL/min/1.73 m2), moderate (eGFRMDRD ≥ 30 to < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2) and severe (eGFRMDRD ≥ 15 to < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2) renal impaired patients respectively compared to healthy volunteers.\nPatients with Hepatic Impairment\nStudies with betrixaban in patients with hepatic impairment have not been conducted and the impact of hepatic impairment on the exposure to betrixaban has not been evaluated.\nDrug Interaction Studies\nThe effects of coadministered drugs on the pharmacokinetics of betrixaban exposure based on drug interaction studies are summarized in Figure 1.\n\n## Nonclinical Toxicology\nCarcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility\nCarcinogenicity studies with betrixaban have not been performed.\nBetrixaban was not mutagenic in bacteria (Ames-Test) or clastogenic in Chinese hamster ovary cells in vitro or in the rat micronucleus test in vivo.\nIn a study to assess fertility and early embryonic development to implantation, oral doses of betrixaban were administered to male and female rats. There was no evidence that betrixaban up to 150 mg/kg/day adversely affected male or female fertility, reproductive performance, or embryo-fetal viability.\n\n# Clinical Studies\nThe clinical evidence for the effectiveness of betrixaban is derived from the APEX clinical trial . APEX was a randomized, double-blind, multinational study comparing extended duration betrixaban (35 to 42 days) to short duration of enoxaparin (6 to 14 days) in the prevention of venous thromboembolic events (VTE) in an acutely medically ill hospitalized population with risk factors for VTE.\nEligible patients included adults who were at least 40 years of age, hospitalized for an acute medical illness, at risk for VTE due to moderate or severe immobility, and had additional risk factors for VTE (described below). Expected duration of hospitalization was at least 3 days and patients were expected to be moderately or severely immobilized for at least 24 hours. The causes for hospitalization included heart failure, respiratory failure, infectious disease, rheumatic disease, or ischemic stroke. At study initiation eligible patients were required to have one of the following additional risk factors for VTE:\n- ≥ 75 years of age,\n- 60 through 74 years of age with D-dimer ≥ 2 ULN, or\n- 40 through 59 years of age with D-dimer ≥ 2 ULN and a history of either VTE or cancer\nA total of 7,513 patients were randomized 1:1 to:\n- Betrixaban arm (betrixaban 160 mg orally on Day 1, then 80 mg once daily for 35 to 42 days AND enoxaparin subcutaneous placebo once daily for 6 to 14 days),\nOR\n- Enoxaparin arm (enoxaparin 40 mg subcutaneously once daily for 6 to 14 days AND betrixaban placebo orally once daily for 35 to 42 days).\nPatients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance ≥ 15 and < 30 mL/min) received reduced doses of study medications (betrixaban 80 mg loading dose, then 40 mg once daily or enoxaparin 20 mg once daily) along with corresponding placebo.\nPatients taking a concomitant P-gp inhibitor received betrixaban 80 mg loading dose, then 40 mg once daily or enoxaparin 40 mg subcutaneously once daily for 6 to 14 days along with corresponding placebo.\nBaseline characteristics were balanced between the treatment groups. The population was 55% female, 93% White, 2% Black, 0.2% Asian, and 5% others. The most prevalent acute medical illness at hospitalization was acutely decompensated heart failure (45%), followed by acute infection without septic shock (29%), acute respiratory failure (12%), acute ischemic stroke (11%) and acute rheumatic disorders (3%). The mean and median ages were 76.4 and 77 years, respectively, with 68% of patients ≥ 75 years of age, 97% were severely immobilized at study entry, and 62% had D-dimer ≥ 2 × ULN.\nWhile the APEX Study was ongoing (after 35% enrollment), the study was amended to restrict further enrollment to patients ≥ 75 years of age or with D-dimer values ≥ 2 × ULN. The APEX trial excluded patients whose condition required prolonged anticoagulation (e.g., concurrent VTE, atrial fibrillation, cardiac valve prosthesis), were at increased risk of bleeding, had liver dysfunction, were on dual antiplatelet therapy, or patients who had both severe renal insufficiency (CrCl 15-29 ml/min) and required the concomitant use of a P-gp inhibitor.\nThe efficacy of betrixaban was based upon the composite outcome of the occurrence of any of the following events up to Day 35 visit:\n- Asymptomatic proximal Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) (detected by ultrasound),\n- Symptomatic proximal or distal DVT,\n- Non-fatal Pulmonary Embolism (PE), or\n- VTE-related death\nEfficacy analyses were performed based on the modified Intent-to-Treat (mITT) population. The mITT population consisted of all patients who had taken at least one dose of study drug and who had follow-up assessment data on one or more primary or secondary efficacy outcome components. A total of 7,441 patients (N=3,721 for betrixaban and N=3,720 for enoxaparin) were included in the mITT population.\nThe efficacy results for the APEX trial are provided in Table 5 below.\nFor patients with D-dimer ≥ 2 ULN at baseline, the event rate is 5.7% in the betrixaban arm vs. 7.2% in the enoxaparin arm (relative risk = 0.79, 95% CI ).\nFor patients with D-dimer ≥ 2 ULN at baseline or age ≥ 75 years, the event rate is 4.7% in the betrixaban arm vs. 6.0% in the enoxaparin arm (relative risk = 0.78, 95% CI ).\nResults for the primary efficacy analysis for subjects that were stratified at randomization to the 80 mg betrixaban dose group in the mITT population are shown in Table 6 below.\nPatients who were randomized to receive 40 mg betrixaban (those with severe renal impairment or receiving P-gp inhibitors), had VTE rates similar to the enoxaparin arm (6 to 14 days followed by placebo) shown in Table 7 below.\n\n# How Supplied\nBetrixaban capsules are available as listed below.\nThe 40 mg size 4 capsules are light grey with 40 printed in black, and have a light blue cap with PTLA printed in white.\n- Bottles of 100 (NDC 69853-0202-1)\nThe 80 mg size 2 capsules are light grey with 80 printed in black, and have a blue cap with PTLA printed in white.\n- Bottles of 100 (NDC 69853-0201-1)\n\n## Storage\nStore at room temperature; 20°C to 25°C (68°F to 77°F).\n\n# Images\n\n## Drug Images\n\n## Package and Label Display Panel\n\n# Patient Counseling Information\nAdvise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide).\n- Risk of Bleeding\nAdvise patients that it might take longer than usual for bleeding to stop, and that they may bruise or bleed more easily when treated with betrixaban.\nInstruct patients to report any unusual bleeding to their physician.\nInstruct patients to tell their physicians and dentists that they are taking betrixaban, and/or any other products known to affect bleeding (including nonprescription products, such as aspirin or NSAIDs), before any surgery or medical or dental procedure is scheduled and before any new drug is taken.\n- Advise patients that it might take longer than usual for bleeding to stop, and that they may bruise or bleed more easily when treated with betrixaban.\n- Instruct patients to report any unusual bleeding to their physician.\n- Instruct patients to tell their physicians and dentists that they are taking betrixaban, and/or any other products known to affect bleeding (including nonprescription products, such as aspirin or NSAIDs), before any surgery or medical or dental procedure is scheduled and before any new drug is taken.\n- Use in Patients with Severe Renal Impairment\nAdvise patients that the risk of bleeding is higher in people who have severe kidney problems (severe renal impairment).\n- Advise patients that the risk of bleeding is higher in people who have severe kidney problems (severe renal impairment).\n- Spinal/Epidural Hematoma\nAdvise patients having neuraxial anesthesia or spinal puncture to watch for signs and symptoms of spinal or epidural hematomas, such as numbness or weakness of the legs, or bowel or bladder dysfunction.\nInstruct patients to contact their physician immediately if any of these symptoms occur.\n- Advise patients having neuraxial anesthesia or spinal puncture to watch for signs and symptoms of spinal or epidural hematomas, such as numbness or weakness of the legs, or bowel or bladder dysfunction.\n- Instruct patients to contact their physician immediately if any of these symptoms occur.\n- Pregnancy and Lactation\nAdvise female patients to inform their physicians if they are pregnant or plan to become pregnant or are breastfeeding or intend to breastfeed during treatment with betrixaban.\n- Advise female patients to inform their physicians if they are pregnant or plan to become pregnant or are breastfeeding or intend to breastfeed during treatment with betrixaban.\n- How to Take Betrixaban\nInstruct patients to take betrixaban with food, and instruct patients on what to do if a dose is missed.\n- Instruct patients to take betrixaban with food, and instruct patients on what to do if a dose is missed.\n\n# Precautions with Alcohol\nAlcohol-Betrixaban interaction has not been established.

They should not be confused with saccular aneurysms (a.k.a. berry aneurysms), which occur in larger-sized blood vessels. Charcot-Bouchard aneurysms are most often located in the brainstem. They are associated with chronic hypertension.\nAs with any aneurysm, once formed they have a tendency to expand and eventually rupture, in keeping with the Law of Laplace. If a Charcot-Bouchard aneurysm ruptures, it will lead to an intracerebral hemorrhage, which can cause hemorrhagic stroke, typically experienced as a sudden focal paralysis or loss of sensation. In contrast, if a saccular aneurysm ruptures, it will lead to a subarachnoid hemorrhage, typically experienced as an extremely severe headache leading to loss of consciousness. Both situations are medical emergencies, but a subarachnoid hemorrhage is more dangerous, with mortality between 25 and 50%.\nCharcot-Bouchard aneurysms are named for the French physicians Jean-Martin Charcot and Charles-Joseph Bouchard. It was Bouchard who discovered these aneurysms during his doctoral research under Charcot. These aneurysms do not exist, they are an artifact from the primitive staining techniques employed by Charcot and Bouchard. The vast majority of hemmorages into the brainstem and basal ganglia are caused by lipohyalinosis of perforating arterioles.\nCharcot-Bouchard aneurysms are a common cause of stroke. They are aneurysms in the small penetrating blood vessels of the brainstem and midbrain.They are associated with hypertension. The common artery involved is lenticulostriate branch of middle cerebral artery. Other causes of intracranial hemorrhage include:\n- Saccular aneurysm (aka berry aneurysm)\n- Ateriovenous malformations", "source": "wikidoc", "question": "According to authoritative guidelines, discuss the contemporary understanding of Charcot‑Bouchard aneurysms—covering their proposed pathogenesis (including the evidence that they may be artefacts), typical vascular locations, associations (eg, hypertension), how rupture clinically presents and how this differs from saccular (berry) aneurysm rupture, and the implications of these points for diagnosis and management of intracerebral haemorrhage."}

{"guideline_text": "VO2 max\n\n# Overview\nVO2 max is the maximum capacity to transport and utilize oxygen during incremental exercise. (The derivation is V̇ - volume per time, O2 - oxygen, max - maximum). It is also called maximal oxygen consumption or maximal oxygen uptake. It is also known as aerobic capacity, which reflects the physical fitness of a person.\nIt is the maximal intake of oxygen that a person can take in at the moment of exhaustion, which is determined according to that person's age, height, weight, fitness level and basal metabolic rate.\nExpressed either as an absolute rate in litres of oxygen per minute (l/min) or as a relative rate in millilitres of oxygen per kilogram of bodyweight per minute (ml/kg/min), the latter expression is often used to compare the performance of endurance sports athletes. A less size-biased measure is to divide by \\sqrt{mass^2} rather than mass.\nIt has become a standard testing method for athletes, athletic and sportive people and even for airplane pilots, car race drivers, and individuals with jobs demanding them to be fit, in good shape and health. It is a part of cardiac and pulmonary screenings too.\n\n# Measuring VO2 max\nAccurately measuring VO2 max involves a physical effort sufficient in duration and intensity to fully tax the aerobic energy system. In general clinical and athletic testing, this usually involves a graded exercise test (either on a treadmill or on a cycle ergometer) in which exercise intensity is progressively increased while measuring ventilation and oxygen and carbon dioxide concentration of the inhaled and exhaled air. V̇O2 max is reached when oxygen consumption remains at steady state despite an increase in workload.\n\n## Fick Equation\nVO2 max is properly defined by the Fick Equation:\nwhere Q is the cardiac output of the heart, CaO2 is the arterial oxygen content, and CvO2 is the venous oxygen content.\n\n## Cooper test\nDr. Kenneth H. Cooper conducted a study for the United States Air Force in the late 1960s. One of the results of this was the Cooper test in which the distance covered running in 12 minutes is measured. An approximate estimate for VO2 max (in ml/min/kg) is:\nwhere d12 is distance (in metres) covered in 12 minutes.\nThere are several other reliable tests and VO2 max calculators to estimate VO2 max.\n\n# VO2 max Levels\nVO2 max varies considerably in the population. The average young untrained male will have a VO2 max of approximately 3.5 litres/minute and 45 ml/min/kg. The average young untrained female will score a VO2 max of approximately 2.0 litres/minute and 38 ml/min/kg. These scores can improve with training and decrease with age, though the degree of trainability also varies very widely.\nIn sports where endurance is an important component in performance, such as cycling, rowing, cross-country skiing and running, world class athletes typically have high VO2 maximums.  World class male athletes, cyclists and cross-country skiers typically exceed 80 ml/kg/min and a rare few may exceed 90 ml/kg/min for men and 70 ml/kg/min for women. Three time Tour de France winner Greg LeMond is reported to have had a VO2 max of 92.5 at his peak - one of the highest ever recorded, while cross-country skier Bjørn Dæhlie measured at an astounding 96 ml/kg/min. It should also be noted that Dæhlie's result was achieved out of season and that physiologist Erlend Hem who was responsible for the testing stated that he would not discount the possibility of the skier passing 100 ml/kg/min at his absolute peak. By comparison a competitive club athlete might achieve a VO2 max of around 70 ml/kg/min. World class rowers are physically very large endurance athletes and typically do not score as high on a per weight basis, but often score exceptionally high in absolute terms. Male rowers typically score VO2 maximums over 6 litres/minute, and some exceptional individuals have exceeded 8 l/min.\nTo put this into perspective, thoroughbred horses have a VO2 max of around 180 ml/min/kg. Siberian dogs running in the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race sled race have VO2 values as high as 240 ml/min/kg.", "source": "wikidoc", "question": "According to authoritative guidelines on VO2 max, discuss how you would select an appropriate method to measure or estimate VO2 max for a 45-year-old recreational cyclist undergoing pre-employment cardiac and pulmonary screening, including (a) the rationale for choosing a direct graded exercise test versus an indirect field test (eg, Cooper test or calculators), (b) how you would interpret results expressed as absolute (L/min) versus relative (ml/kg/min) values given the patient’s body size and sex, and (c) the main physiological and methodological limitations that should be communicated when using VO2 max to assess fitness or occupational suitability."}

{"guideline_text": "Markers for early detection of cancer: Statistical guidelines for nested case-control studies\n\nBackground: Recently many long-term prospective studies have involved serial collection and storage of blood or tissue specimens. This has spurred nested case-control studies that involve testing some specimens for various markers that might predict cancer. Until now there has been little guidance in statistical design and analysis of these studies.Methods:To develop statistical guidelines, we considered the purpose, the types of biases, and the opportunities for extracting additional information.Results:The following guidelines:(1) For the clearest interpretation, statistics should be based on false and true positive rates -not odds ratios or relative risks(2) To avoid overdiagnosis bias, cases should be diagnosed as a result of symptoms rather than on screening.(3) To minimize selection bias, the spectrum of control conditions should be the same in study and target screening populations.(4) To extract additional information, criteria for a positive test should be based on combinations of individual markers and changes in marker levels over time.(5) To avoid overfitting, the criteria for a positive marker combination developed in a training sample should be evaluated in a random test sample from the same study and, if possible, a validation sample from another study.(6) To identify biomarkers with true and false positive rates similar to mammography, the training, test, and validation samples should each include at least 110 randomly selected subjects without cancer and 70 subjects with cancer.Conclusion: These guidelines ensure good practice in the design and analysis of nested casecontrol studies of early detection biomarkers.\n\n# Background\nMost current methods of cancer early detection, such as mammography or cervical cytology, are based on anatomic changes in tissues or morphologic changes in cells. Recently, various molecular markers, such as protein or genetic changes have been proposed for cancer early detection [bib_ref] Lysophosphatidic acid as a potential biomarker for ovarian and other gynecologic cancers, Xu [/bib_ref] [bib_ref] Insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-1 and prostate cancer, Signorello [/bib_ref] [bib_ref] Serum pepsinogens in relation to precancerous gastric lesions in a population at..., You [/bib_ref] [bib_ref] Serum human glandular kallikrein-2 protease levels predict the presence of prostate cancer..., Nam [/bib_ref]. This has spurred many investigators with long-term cohort studies to serially collect and store blood or tissue specimens. The aim is to later perform a nestedcase control study, where specimens from subjects with a particular type of cancer (cases) and specimens from a random sample of subjects without the cancer (controls) are tested for various molecular markers. Sometime this sort of study is called a retrospective longitudinal study [bib_ref] Phases of biomarker development for early detection of cancer, Pepe [/bib_ref] although retrospective longitudinal data could arise in other ways, as well. Unlike cross-sectional study designs, the markers are measured on specimens collected well before the onset of clinical disease in cases. This avoids the potential confounding effect of the target disease on the marker.\nFor example, in the ATBC (alpha-tocopherol, beta-carotene)and CARET [bib_ref] Risk factors for lung cancer and for intervention effects in CARET, the..., Omenn [/bib_ref] studies, subjects were randomized to placebo or drug to in a long-term study to determine the effect of the drug on lung cancer mortality. During the course of the trial serum was serially collected and stored in a biorepository. In a subsequent nested casecontrol study, stored serum samples from all cases of prostate cancer and a random sample of controls were tested for prostate-specific antigen (PSA).\nImportantly the nested case-control study of early detection biomarkers may be distinct from the original longterm study from which serum were collected. It is designed to answer a different question, it typically studies subjects with a different disease, and it often ignores the intervention in the original long-term study.\n\n# Methods\nWe had three considerations in formulating appropriate guidelines. First we wanted to link the analysis to the goal of study, namely, to help decide on further study of the biomarker as a trigger for early intervention. Second we wanted to minimize possible biases in the selection of cases and the controls and in the investigation of many markers. Third, we wanted to extract as much information as possible relevant to the evaluation.\n\n# Results\nWe offer the following guidelines for the design and analysis of nested case-control studies of early detection cancer biomarkers.\n1. For the clearest interpretation, statistics for binary markers should be based on true and false positive rates or predictive values based on the true prevalence -not odds ratios, relative risks, or predictive values based on the prevalence in the study A promising marker should have a high degree of accuracy in discriminating between subjects who are likely to get cancer from those who are not. For a binary marker, which is either positive or negative, the basic measures of this type of accuracy are the true positive and false positive rates. Consider the hypothetical data in the [fig_ref] Table 1: Hypothetical data for a binary marker from a nested case-control study [/fig_ref] from a nested case-control study of early detection biomarkers. The true positive rate (TPR), or the test sensitivity, is the probability the marker is positive given cancer. The false positive rate (FPR), or 1 -specificity, is the probability the marker is positive given no cancer. In [fig_ref] Table 1: Hypothetical data for a binary marker from a nested case-control study [/fig_ref] , TPR is estimated by 80/100 = .80, and FPR is estimated by 10/1000 = 01. For a perfect test, TPR = 1 and the FPR = 0. There is always a tradeoff between the TPR and FPR, so it is meaningless to assess one without assessing the other. For example, one could make the TPR equal to 1 simply by classifying every subject as positive for cancer. But this would be a poor classification rule because the FPR would also be 1.\n\n## Guidelines for fpr and tpr\nBecause the underlying prevalence of cancer is so low in average risk populations, for acceptable cancer screening of asymptomatic people, the FPR should be very small [bib_ref] Some limitations and problems of screening for cancer, Lillienfeld [/bib_ref]. As a starting point we recommend basing guidelines for FPR and TPR on the FPR and TPR for mammography, which, as discussed below, is FPR=.01 and TPR=.80. A mammogram is analogous to a biomarker test for cancer but there is extra information from various studies that makes it useful for setting guidelines.\nOne reason for using FPR and TPR from mammography as a standard is that, unlike biomarker measurements in nested case-control studies, in mammography studies there is a biopsy at the time of a positive test. This biopsy is the gold standard for determining cancer status in subjects with positive mammograms and is used for comput- True positive rate (TPR) = 80/100 = .80 = sensitivity False positive rate (FPR) = 10/1000 = .01 = 1 -specificity ing TPR in a way not possible with biomarkers in nested case-control studies. The TPR for mammography is the probability of a positive biopsy as a direct result of mammography in women with cancer and is estimated via mathematical models or data collected after following subjects not biopsied. As discussed in Baker and Pinsky [bib_ref] A proposed design and analysis for comparing digital and analog mammography: special..., Baker [/bib_ref] , estimates ranged from .74 to 1.00 with .80 a conservative value.\nImportantly the estimated TPR for mammography is not likely to be affected by overdiagnosis, which means that some screening-detected cancers would never have caused medical problems during the patient's life [bib_ref] Prostate-cancer screening-what we know and what we need to know, Kramer [/bib_ref]. This would make the biomarker appear more promising than actually the case. Results from the HIP screening trial of mammography and clinical self-examination [bib_ref] Periodic Screening for Breast Cancer, The Health Insurance Plan Project and Its..., Shaprio [/bib_ref] suggest that if there were overdiagnosis with mammography, it would be relatively small. At the time of the last breast screening in the HIP trial, there were more cancers in the group randomized to screening than in the controls. But with further follow-up the number of cancers in the control group eventually equaled the number in the screened group, which would not have occurred if there were substantial overdiagnosis.\nA second reason for using FPR and TPR from mammography is that, based on various randomized trials with cancer mortality endpoint, mammography is generally considered an acceptable screening modality. The implication is that a similar FPR and TPR for a biomarker would lead to an acceptable screening modality. For a particular biomarker, these target values of FPR and TPR from mammography may need modification depending on various factors. One factor is the invasiveness of a follow-up procedure to investigate a positive test (e.g. needle biopsy of the prostate to investigate an abnormal PSA versus laparotomy to investigate an abnormal CA125). The more invasive the follow-up procedure, the lower the FPR must be to gain acceptance in practice. A second factor is additional work-up prior to a biopsy. If a positive biomarker is unlikely to trigger additional diagnostic work-ups prior to biopsy, a higher FPR might be acceptable.\nOne caveat when using FPR from mammography is to be careful as to its definition. The restricted definition is the probability of a positive biopsy as a direct result of mammography in women without cancer. The less restricted definition is the probability of a suspicious mammogram warranting additional diagnostic follow-up of any type in women without cancer. Typically nested-case control studies of early detection biomarkers do not provide information on additional diagnostic follow-up. Therefore they cannot be used to estimate a less restricted FPR involving diagnostic follow-up. However, because nested case-control biomarker studies provide data on cancer di-agnosis, they can be used to estimate a more restricted FPR based on unnecessary biopsies. Therefore the target FPR is based on the more restricted definition of FPR in mammography. For mammography the more restricted FPR is estimated by the fraction of women screened by mammography who received a biopsy in which no cancer was detected. As discussed in Baker and Pinsky [bib_ref] A proposed design and analysis for comparing digital and analog mammography: special..., Baker [/bib_ref] , estimates of FPR from three studies ranged from .005 to .013 with a middle value of around .010.\n\n## Inappropriateness of odds ratio and relative risk\nWhen evaluating binary early detection markers, it is inappropriate to report an odds ratio or relative risk, as is common in epidemiology or clinical trials. Because an odds ratio or relative risk is a single number, it does not capture the tradeoff between correctly classifying cancer and incorrectly classifying non-cancers. Also the odds ratio or relative risk can lead to an overoptimistic impression of the performance of an early detection test if the interpretation is based on experience in epidemiology or clinical trials. In the latter settings an odds ratio of 3 is often considered large. Much larger odds ratio are needed from early detection tests for useful application in the screening setting [bib_ref] Analysis of repeated markers used to predict progression of cancer, Emir [/bib_ref]. For example, for the target values of FPR = .01 and TPR = .80, the odds ratio equals (TPR × (1-FPR)/ ((1-TPR) × FPR) = 396, as in [fig_ref] Table 1: Hypothetical data for a binary marker from a nested case-control study [/fig_ref].\n\n## Appropriate computation of predictive values\nIt is sometimes useful to use the FPR and TPR to compute the predictive value negative (PVN), the probability of no disease if the marker is negative, and the predictive value positive (PVP), the probability of disease if the marker is positive. For cancer screening, it is the PVP that is most important to the physician in clinical decision-making. Because the likelihood of any individual cancer type in an asymptomatic person is nearly always very low, a negative early detection test usually adds little information to the clinical impression. The computation of the PVN and PVP depend on the prevalence of cancer as well as on the FPR and the TPR, as shown below,\n[formula] PVP = (TPR × prevalence) / (TPR × prevalence + FPR (1- prevalence)) PVN = (1-FPR) × (1-prevalence) / ((1-TPR) × prevalence + (1-FPR) (1-prevalence)) [/formula]\nWhen the prevalence is small, as with cancer screening, a small absolute change in FPR, but not TPR, can have a large impact on the PVP. It is erroneous to directly compute the prevalence from data in the nested case-control study, as in [fig_ref] Table 1: Hypothetical data for a binary marker from a nested case-control study [/fig_ref] , because the ratio of cases to controls in the study is not the same as in the population. For ex- [fig_ref] Table 2: Hypothetical Data for an Ordered Marker From a Nested Case-Control Design [/fig_ref] and generate a receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve, which is a plot of TPR versus FPR for the various pairs [bib_ref] Measuring the accuracy of diagnostic systems, Swets [/bib_ref]. (See [fig_ref] Figure 1: ROC curve derived from hypothetical data in [/fig_ref]. The higher and farther left the points on the ROC curve the better the test performance. As mentioned previously, acceptable cancer screening requires very small false positive rates. Therefore, for evaluating cancer biomarkers, we are only interested in the leftmost sliver of the ROC curve in [fig_ref] Figure 1: ROC curve derived from hypothetical data in [/fig_ref].\n\n## To avoid overdiagnosis bias, cases should be diagnosed as a result of symptoms rather than on screening\nFor the TPR in the biomarker study to reflect the true TPR, cases should be diagnosed as a result of symptoms rather than on screening. For example in the study of PSA in the ATBC trial, cases were subjects diagnosed with prostate cancer as a result of symptoms. If the prostate cancer cases were detected as the result of screening, say with ultrasound, the TPR could be artificially elevated if there were overdiagnosis, as previously discussed.\n\n## To minimized selection bias, the spectrum of control conditions should be the same in study and target screening populations\nFor the FPR in the nested case-control study to reflect the true FPR in the target population, the spectrum of control conditions should be the same as in the target population. By control conditions, we mean characteristics of the population, such as the presence of other diseases or certain known risk factors that could elevate the false positive rate.\nThe spectrum of conditions could differ considerably if the retrospective biomarker study were embedded in a [fig_ref] Table 2: Hypothetical Data for an Ordered Marker From a Nested Case-Control Design [/fig_ref].\nBecause acceptable cancer screening requires a very small false positive rate (FPR) and a reasonable true positive rate (TPR), only the four points farthest to the left are relevant for biomarker evaluation.\nrandomized trial with strict eligibility requirements. For example, consider a biomarker for the early detection of lung cancer where the data comes from a biorepository arising from a randomized trial of healthy subjects. It would be inappropriate to apply the results to a population with a high prevalence of chronic obstructive lung disease, bronchitis, or viral pnuemonitis because these conditions could increase the number of positive readings in subjects without lung cancer. Because FPR is very small for screening to be acceptable, this spectrum bias could have important consequences in a clinical application.\nIt would not always be possible to identify all relevant control conditions, but to the extent possible, the control conditions should be similar in both populations.\n\n## To extract additional information, criteria for a positive test should be based on combinations of individual markers and changes in marker levels over time\nData from multiple markers present an opportunity to extract potentially valuable information not available by analyzing markers separately. Consider the hypothetical data in [fig_ref] Table 3: Hypothetical data for two ordered markers, A and B [/fig_ref]. The left side corresponds to subjects without cancer, and the right corresponds to subjects with cancer. In our idealized circumstance, markers A and B are independent for subjects without cancer and are perfectly correlated for subjects with cancer. The indicated region for A = 2 or A = 3 and B = 2 or B = 3 designates a positive test that has FPR = .04 and the TPR = .80. Suppose that marker A and marker B were evaluated separately. The indicated region corresponding to A only, namely A = 2 or A = 3 and the indicated region corresponding to B only, namely B = 2 and B = 3, each designates a positive test that has FPR=. 20 and TPR=. 80. Thus, in this particular example, the combination of markers leads to a much better test than the separate markers, with a smaller FPR (.04 ver-sus .20) for the same TPR of .80. One could create a similar example with any number of marker levels. For an ideal test in which FPR = 0 and TPR = 1, the region would encompass all subjects with cancer but no subjects without cancer.\nA real application of how marker combinations provide extra information comes from a recent study by Mok et al [bib_ref] Prostasin, a potential serum marker for ovarian cancer: Identification through microarray technology, Mok [/bib_ref] on CA125 and Prostasin as markers for ovarian cancer. Although the data are not from a nested case-control study and have not been validated in subsequent studies, they are useful for illustration. Based on of Mok et al [bib_ref] Prostasin, a potential serum marker for ovarian cancer: Identification through microarray technology, Mok [/bib_ref] with approximate values for the outpoints, we investigated regions with FPR=.02. The combination for a positive test of CA 125 greater than or equal to 40 U/ml and Prostasin greater than or equal to 5 µg/ml had FPR = .02 and TPR = .92. Evaluating CA 125 alone, the criterion for a positive test of CA 125 greater than 80 U/ml had FPR=.02 and TPR =.78. Evaluating Prostasin alone, the criterion for a positive test of Prostasin greater than 15 µg/ml had FPR=. 02 and TPR=. 32. Thus, in this real example, the combination of markers led to a better test than the separate markers, with a larger TPR (.92 versus .78 or .32) for the same FPR of .02.\nTo more generally compare performance of a combination of markers with a single marker, we need to compare ROC curves. Creating an ROC curve from a combination of markers is different from creating an ROC curve from a single marker. With a combination of markers, the number of possible regions, as in [fig_ref] Table 3: Hypothetical data for two ordered markers, A and B [/fig_ref] a, for calling a marker positive is extremely large. Some choices of regions correspond to AND rules, for example A>1 and B>1, as in [fig_ref] Table 3: Hypothetical data for two ordered markers, A and B [/fig_ref] a. Some choices of regions correspond to OR rules, for example A>2 or B>2. Other choices are also possible, but for biological reasons, one would usually require all regions to be contiguous. A plot of the FPR and TPR for each region would lead to a cloud of points, rather than the smooth curve in [fig_ref] Figure 1: ROC curve derived from hypothetical data in [/fig_ref]. To create the best ROC curve, one should select those points that are highest and farthest to the left, which is generally all that would need to be presented and only for small false positive rates. For complicated situations, Baker [bib_ref] Identifying combinations of cancer markers for further study as triggers of early..., Baker [/bib_ref] proposed an algorithm to select the regions creating the best ROC curve without the need to enumerate all the regions. Mathematically, in any sample of data, the best ROC curve for a combination of markers must be as good or better than the ROC curve for any of the markers evaluated separately. The reason is that the set of possible regions for calling a combination of markers positive includes as a special case the regions for calling any single marker positive.\n[formula] A = 1 A = 2 A = 3 B only A = 1 A = 2 A = 3 B [/formula]\nAlternative approaches that do not directly optimize the ROC curve include linear logistic regression or linear discriminant analysis [bib_ref] Multiple markers for lung cancer diagnosis: validation of models for advanced lung..., Gail [/bib_ref] , which choose regions based on linear combinations of the markers, and neural networks, which choose regions in a very complicated nonlinear manner. Due to the potential for overfitting (to follow), it is not possible to make a blanket statement as to which approach for choosing regions is best. If one takes the set of regions for calling a combination positive that gives a good ROC curve in a random sample of data, it may give a poor ROC curve in another random sample of the data, simply due to selecting chance patterns in the first sample. As discussed in the section on overfitting, this motivates splitting the data into two random samples, training and test, and using the regions from the training sample to compute the definitive ROC curve based on data in the test sample.\nChanges in marker values over time also provide potentially valuable information not available when examining markers at a single time point. With marker measurements at two different times per subject (and approximately the same interval between times), a common summary measure is the slope. If investigators believe that both slope and baseline level predict cancer, the combination can be evaluated using the previously discussed methods for evaluating multiple markers, namely, treating baseline level and slope as two \"separate\" markers. With measurements at more than two times per subject, investigators may identify a more complicated feature, such as whether or not there is a sudden increase in marker levels [bib_ref] Estimating unknown transition times using a piecewise nonlinear mixed-effects model in men..., Morell [/bib_ref].\nWhen biomarker measurements occur at regular time intervals (and allowing different numbers of measurements for each subject), one can estimate TPR and FPR by using a first order Markov chain in reverse time, as described by Baker and Tockman [bib_ref] Evaluating serial observations of precancerous lesions for further study as a trigger..., Baker [/bib_ref] for the analysis of precancerous lesions for lung cancer.\n\n## To avoid overfitting, the criteria for a positive marker combination developed in a training sample should be evaluated in a random test sample from the same study and, if possible, a validation sample from another study.\nWith a single marker and a large number of subjects, there is usually no concern with overfitting. However with many combinations of markers, overfitting could invalidate results. Overfitting is often associated with step-wise regression models [bib_ref] Modelling strategies for improved prognostic prediction, Harrell [/bib_ref] but it can occur in other situations as well. Overfitting of a larger number of markers to a relatively small number of subjects produces a model that is overly sensitive to chance fluctuations in the data. As a simple example, overfitting occurs when a sports announcer reports that a baseball player had a very high batting average against left-handed pitchers in ballpark X over the past month. This average is not very reliable for future predictions because the particular set of factors, left-handed pitchers and ballpark X, were selected to give a high average. In reality the high average is more likely the result of chance factors that coincided with left handed pitchers at ballpark X during that particular month. One way to adjust for overfitting is to apply the factors in another sample not used for initial reporting. The first sample is known as the training sample, and the second sample is known as the test sample. For example, the prediction of the average against left handed pitchers in the ballpark X could be tested on data from a different month. Similarly, a standard statistical approach to adjust for overfitting is to randomly split the data into a training and test samples. This is called the split-sample approach. Promising marker combinations are identified in the training sample, but more reliable FPR and TPR measurements are made in the test sample because it involves different data. Baker [bib_ref] Identifying combinations of cancer markers for further study as triggers of early..., Baker [/bib_ref] used the split-sample approach to evaluate the performance of four markers for prostate cancer.\nMore sophisticated adjustments for overfitting include cross-validation and bootstrapping. Suppose the interest lies in a single statistic, such as the area under the part of the ROC curve corresponding to a small FPR. In a typical cross-validation analysis (i) the data are randomly split into ten samples each with 10% of the data, (ii) one of the 10% samples is deleted, (iii) the statistic is computed by applying the classification rule recalculated from the remaining 90% of the sample to the deleted 10% sample and (iv) an average is taken of the statistic over all ten 10% samples [bib_ref] Internal validation of predictive models; Efficiency of some procedures for logistic regression, Steyerberg [/bib_ref]. Although one could use a different fraction than 10%, ROC computation it is not possible with the most extreme version of cross-validation that involves leaving out one subject at a time. With bootstrapping, (i) the entire data set is resampled with replacement many times, (ii) on each resampling the statistics is computed, and (iii) the statistics from each resampling are combined in a special way [bib_ref] Internal validation of predictive models; Efficiency of some procedures for logistic regression, Steyerberg [/bib_ref]. In a recent study comparing these adjustments with other types of statistics in a different setting, Steyerberg et al [bib_ref] Internal validation of predictive models; Efficiency of some procedures for logistic regression, Steyerberg [/bib_ref] found that the split-sample approach tended to underestimate performance, crossvalidation performed poorly on some statistics that were not normally distributed, and bootstrapping performed best overall. For our purposes of estimating an entire ROC curve rather than a summary statistic, more research is needed for cross-validation and bootstrapping, as it is not clear how best to combine ROC curves over different samples.\nRegardless of the method used to adjust for overfitting in forming a classification rule, to obtain the most reliable FPR and TPR measurements, the classification rule should ideally be evaluated in a validation sample from a different study, as in Baker [bib_ref] Identifying combinations of cancer markers for further study as triggers of early..., Baker [/bib_ref].\n\n## To identify biomarkers with true and false positive rates similar to mammography, the training, test, and validation samples should each include at least 110 randomly selected subjects without cancer and 70 subjects with cancer (as based on fpr and tpr for mammography)\nThe sample size is based on the need to determine if the biomarker is sufficiently promising for investigation as a trigger for early intervention in a future trial. As discussed previously, based on considerations from mammography, our target values are FPR = .01 and TPR= .80. In most situations, we think it would be of interest to specify a 95% confidence interval for TPR of (.70, .90). Using a normal approximation the target standard error is approximately .05. Setting the standard error of TPR, TPR × (1-TPR) / (square root of n), equal to .05 and solving for the sample size n, we obtain n= 64, which we round up to 70. In addition we think that in most situations the largest reasonable value of FPR would be .03 which is 3 times the number of false positives as with mammography screening. Because FPR is so small, we do not use a normal approximation. We specify a sample size of n = 110, so that under the binomial distribution with FPR=.01, the upper 2.5% bound equals .03 × 110. Strictly, these sample sizes apply only after a single criterion for a positive test has been identified. For a training sample, one might consider larger sample sizes.\n\n# Conclusion\nA major advantage of nested case-control studies for early detection biomarkers is that they can be done quickly if serum from a long-term study has been stored in a biorepository. Importantly the retrospective aspect does not compromise the validity. There are none of the usual problems with retrospective studies such as recall bias.\nThus we anticipate that in the coming years, there will be many reports in literature from studies of this design.\nThese guidelines should greatly help investigators design and analyze nested case-control studies for early detection biomarkers and help readers of the literature to interpret them. It bears emphasis that these studies do not prove clinical efficacy of the markers. Rather, they suggest which markers or marker combinations are the most promising candidates for further study as a trigger for early intervention in definitive trials with cancer-mortality endpoints.\n[fig] Figure 1: ROC curve derived from hypothetical data in [/fig]\n[table] Table 1: Hypothetical data for a binary marker from a nested case-control study [/table]\n[table] Table 2: Hypothetical Data for an Ordered Marker From a Nested Case-Control Design [/table]\n[table] Table 3: Hypothetical data for two ordered markers, A and B [/table]", "source": "pubmed", "question": "According to authoritative guidelines, outline how you would design and analyze a nested case–control study to evaluate a candidate biomarker for early cancer detection, specifically addressing: the choice of performance metrics (and why odds ratios/relative risks are inappropriate), case and control selection strategies to avoid overdiagnosis and selection/spectrum biases, how to exploit multiple markers and serial measurements to define positive-test criteria, procedures to prevent and assess overfitting (including training/test/validation approaches and alternative internal-validation methods), the sample-size requirements recommended for training, test and validation sets (with rationale based on mammography FPR/TPR benchmarks), and how to compute and interpret predictive values in the context of low disease prevalence."}
{"guideline_text": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in Canada and the United States. A positive family history (FH) significantly increases the risk of developing CRC, and screening programs can substantially reduce CRC incidence and mortality. These consensus recommendations were developed by the Canadian Association of Gastroenterology (CAG), with US and Canadian experts, and endorsed by the American Gastroenterological Association. The purpose was to systematically and critically review the literature and provide specific recommendations See editorial on page 1298.# \nBACKGROUND & AIMS: A family history (FH) of colorectal cancer (CRC) increases the risk of developing CRC. These consensus recommendations developed by the Canadian Association of Gastroenterology and endorsed by the American Gastroenterological Association, aim to provide guidance on screening these high-risk individuals. METHODS: Multiple parallel systematic review streams, informed by 10 literature searches, assembled evidence on 5 principal questions around the effect of an FH of CRC or adenomas on the risk of CRC, the age to initiate screening, and the optimal tests and testing intervals. The GRADE (Grading of Recommendation Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach was used to develop the recommendations. RESULTS: Based on the evidence, the Consensus Group was able to strongly recommend CRC screening for all individuals with an FH of CRC or documented adenoma. However, because most of the evidence was very-low quality, the majority of the remaining statements were conditional (\"we suggest\"). Colonoscopy is suggested (recommended in individuals with 2 first-degree relatives ), with fecal immunochemical test as an alternative. The elevated risk associated with an FH of 1 FDRs with CRC or documented advanced adenoma suggests initiating screening at a younger age (eg, 40-50 years or 10 years younger than age of diagnosis of FDR). In addition, a shorter interval of every 5 years between screening tests was suggested for individuals with 2 FDRs, and every 5-10 years for those with FH of 1 FDR with CRC or documented advanced adenoma compared to average-risk individuals. Choosing screening parameters for an individual patient should consider the age of the affected FDR and local resources. It is suggested that individuals with an FH of 1 second-degree relatives only, or of nonadvanced adenoma or polyp of unknown histology, be screened according to averagerisk guidelines. CONCLUSIONS: The increased risk of CRC associated with an FH of CRC or advanced adenoma warrants more intense screening for CRC. Well-designed prospective studies are needed in order to make definitive evidence-based recommendations about the age to commence screening and appropriate interval between screening tests.\nfor CRC screening of individuals with an FH of nonhereditary CRC or adenoma. This is the first guideline to use systematic reviews and the GRADE (Grading of Recommendation Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach to make recommendations for screening for CRC in this high-risk population. Multiple parallel systematic review streams, informed by 10 literature searches, assembled evidence on 5 principal questions: (1) effect of an FH of CRC on an individual's risk of CRC, (2) effect of an FH of adenoma on an individual's risk of CRC, (3) age at which screening should begin, (4) optimal screening tests, and (5) optimal testing intervals for individuals with an FH of CRC or adenoma. The GRADE approach was used to assess the quality of evidence. Questions were developed through an iterative online platform, and then statements were developed and voted on by a group of specialists.\nConsensus was reached on 19 statements addressing 5 main patient risk categories, including individuals with 2 or more first-degree relative (FDRs) with CRC, 1 FDR with CRC, 1 or more FDRs with advanced adenoma, 1 or more seconddegree relatives (SDRs) with CRC, and 1 or more FDR with any non-advanced adenoma (Table 1).\nBecause of the lack of high-quality data, the majority of statements are conditional recommendations (\"we suggest\"). However, based on moderate-quality evidence, the Consensus Group is able to strongly recommend CRC screening over no screening for all individuals with an FH of CRC or documented adenoma. In addition, despite very-lowquality evidence, colonoscopy is recommended in individuals with 2 or more FDRs with CRC, because of the high-risk of life-threatening negative consequences of missed lesions.\nBased on available data and consensus, Table 2 provides a concise summary of the preferred and secondchoice screening tests, the age at which screening should begin, and the interval for screening according to the level of elevated CRC risk for each patient subgroup. For individual at highest risk (2 or more FDRs with a history of CRC), we recommend screening with colonoscopy, which we suggest begin at age 40-50 years or 10 years younger than the age of diagnosis of the FDR (whichever is earlier), at an interval of every 5 years. For individuals with 1 FDR with a history of CRC or advanced adenoma, we suggest commencing CRC screening at age 40-50 years or 10 years younger than the age of diagnosis of the FDR (whichever is earlier), at an interval of every 5-10 years. For those with an FH of CRC, colonoscopy is suggested with fecal immunochemical test (FIT) as an alternative, while both tests are suggested options for those with an FH of advanced adenoma. Finally, it is suggested that individuals with an FH of 1 or more SDRs only, or of nonadvanced adenoma or polyp of unknown histology be screened according to average-risk guidelines.\nExcept for the statements for those at the highest risk, age ranges are provided. The relationship between the age at which an affected FDR was diagnosed with CRC and an individual's risk of developing CRC is difficult to define. The evidence shows that the risk falls on a continuum, and that there is no clearly defined age above or below which a clear inflection in risk can be recognized. The Consensus Group carefully considered the issue of recommending a range of years, acknowledging that some clinicians and programs may wish for greater precision. However, the evidence in cases where a range was recommended does not support a specific age point. Definitive statements in these circumstances are misleading and imply a degree of certainty that does not currently exist. Furthermore, specifying a range allows some flexibility, including consideration of the age of the affected FDR and local resources, and underscores the need for further data, which will hopefully lead to greater clarity in the future.\nThe Consensus Group acknowledged that heritable cancers tend to occur at an earlier age and that this heritable risk decreases with advancing age of the diagnosis of the CRC in the FDR. That being the case, the age of the affected relative should be considered when making clinical decisions regarding screening. For example, having an FDR diagnosed at 75-90 years of age is unlikely to seriously impact an individual's risk of CRC, while an FDR diagnosed at age 35 years is probably highly relevant. Therefore, we acknowledge that national or provincial programs may wish to set specific FDR age cutoffs for screening, based on additional factors, including feasibility, cost, and cost-effectiveness. From an evidence perspective, we are, unfortunately, not able to provide clear guidance at this time. Future research should prioritize prospective studies that assess the optimal time to initiate screening and appropriate intervals between screening tests.\n\n# Introduction\nColorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer in Canada, and the fourth leading cause in the United States. 1,2 It is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in both countries, with approximately 9400 Canadians, and 50,260 Americans dying of the disease annually. The 2017 estimated incidence of new cases CRC was 26,800 Canadians, and 135,430 Americans, and the prevalence of individuals living with CRC was 105,195 Canadians (2009) and 1.3 million Americans (2014). 1,2 A systematic review (SR) estimated the prevalence of an individual having 1 or more first-degree relatives (FDRs) with CRC to be 3%-10%, and of having 2 or more FDRs with CRC to be about 0.3%. 3 Many of these individuals with a positive family history (FH) are at an increased risk of developing CRC. However, the magnitude of the individual's increased risk appears to be dependent on the degree of relationship to the affected relative, age of the affected relative at time of diagnosis, and the age of the individual. Overall CRC burden in a family (ie, total number of individuals with CRC on the same side of the family) also increases the magnitude of the individual's CRC risk. This may be a red flag for an inherited CRC syndrome. 4 CRC usually develops from premalignant polyps, and CRC screening can be used to detect and remove these polyps or localized cancer. Evidence from studies conducted in individuals primarily at \"average risk\" for CRC shows that screening (with endoscopy or occult blood tests) can reduce CRC mortality and incidence.  Guidelines and the introduction of population-based screening programs have led to substantially increased uptake of CRC screening. Rates in the United States and Canada were about 25%-35% before 2003, but have increased to 55%-60% in 2012-2013 surveys. 8,9 Individuals with an FH of CRC are more likely to adhere to CRC screening recommendations compared to those with no FH. 3 But even among this higher-risk population, participation rates remain less than optimal. 3, While a variety of guidelines for screening individuals for CRC are available, the majority apply to patients at average risk,  or those at highest risk due to inherited germline mutations associated with CRC and polyposis. 4,23,24 The few guidelines that make detailed recommendations for screening individuals with an FH of CRC or adenoma have not systematically reviewed the literature in this specific population. 17,19,20 Recent guidelines from the US Multi-Society Task Force on CRC screening used a modified process to systematically review published literature on this topic, however, systematic assessments of the methodological quality of the individual studies were not presented, and the paper was published after our consensus meeting. 22 For this guideline, systematic literature searches were conducted and the quality of evidence (QoE) and strength of recommendations were rated using the Grading of Recommendation Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. 25 This guideline specifically excludes individuals with hereditary syndromes, such as Lynch syndrome, familial adenomatous polyposis, attenuated familial adenomatous polyposis, MUTYH-associated polyposis, Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, juvenile polyposis syndrome, Cowden syndrome, serrated (hyperplastic) polyposis syndrome, hereditary pancreatic cancer, and hereditary gastric cancer. However, hereditary CRCs occurring due to mutations and defects in certain genes account for about 5% of all CRC. 4 Given the substantial risk of CRC and extracolonic cancers warranting specific screening strategies, it is important to identify these patients with hereditary syndromes. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network proposed 9 recommendations (summarized in Table 3) for patients who should be referred to a genetics provider for further assessment of a hereditary cancer syndrome. In addition, many jurisdictions and hospitals have implemented universal screening programs for CRC and endometrial cancers that include microsatellite instability or immunohistochemistry to identify patients at risk of Lynch syndrome. These individuals should be managed according to appropriate guidelines for individuals with hereditary gastrointestinal cancer syndromes. 4,23,24 The purpose of this guideline was to systematically and critically review the literature and provide specific recommendations for CRC screening of individuals with an FH of nonhereditary CRC or adenoma.\n\n# Methods\n\n# Scope and Purpose\nQuestions around screening for CRC in individuals with an FH of nonhereditary CRC or adenomas were identified and discussed by the participants, aided by evidence derived from review of the literature on CRC screening. Specifically, the processes focused on 5 principal questions. \n\n# Sources, Literature Searches, and Systematic Reviews\nEvidence for these consensus guidelines was gathered via multiple parallel SR streams. The SRs were informed by a series of 10 literature searches. The scope, search strategy, and yield of each literature search are shown in Supplementary Table 1. All SRs (and the corresponding metaanalyses, where applicable) were performed by the 2 GRADE methodologists (GL and FT), with one exception, an SR of prospective studies on the risk of CRC among individuals with an FH of CRC/adenoma vs those without, which was led by Ahmed M. Abou-Setta, with the data being independently confirmed by the GRADE methodologists. All searches, data extractions, and analyses were performed by 1 investigator and double-checked by a second investigator, with any disagreements resolved by consensus. Most of the literature searches supported more than 1 of the SRs, and most SRs depended on 2 or more literature searches. The streams of evidence and the research questions they addressed are briefly summarized in Table 4. The results of the SRs (along with the assessments of the QoE) were forwarded to the Consensus Group members 1 week before the face-to-face meeting.\nAll analyses were performed using the Cochrane Collaboration's Review Manager (RevMan).\n\n# Assessment of the Quality of Evidence\nThe GRADE approach 25 was used by 2 nonvoting methodologists (GL, FT) to assess the following: risk of bias (of individual studies and overall, across studies), indirectness, inconsistency, imprecision, and other aspects (including publication bias) in order to determine the overall quality (trustworthiness) of evidence for each statement. As is described in GRADE 25,26 and used in prior Canadian Association of Gastroenterology (CAG) consensus documents,  the descriptors of high, moderate, low, or very low were used to grade the QoE for each statement. One week before the face-to-face meeting, the voting members of the CRC Consensus Group had access to the GRADE assessments (including evidence profiles, the results of the SRs and meta-analyses conducted for this guideline,   \n\n# Consensus Process\nThe Consensus Group included 8 voting members: the meeting chair (DL), and 6 other gastroenterologists and clinical epidemiologists, as well as a family physician. The voting group included 2 participants from the United States (NJS, DAL). Nonvoting members included the moderator (JKM) and 2 GRADE methodologists (GIL, FT), 1 of whom acted as a co-moderator (GIL). The meeting was observed by members of the CAG and the Canadian Partnership Against Cancer. A patient advocate provided valuable insight during the initial guideline development.\nA web-based platform (ECD solutions, Atlanta, GA) was used by the CAG to facilitate the consensus process before the 2-day face-to-face meeting held in Banff, Alberta, Canada in March 2017. Voting members used the platform to answer the principal questions to be addressed during the meeting and provided valuable comments, feedback, and suggested sources of evidence. All participants had access to the results of literature searches and relevant references.\nAt the meeting, the GRADE methodologists presented the data and provided the group with a review of the GRADE evaluations leading to the QoE determination for each of the questions. A modification of the Evidence-to-Decision (EtD) framework was applied to facilitate ranking of multiple screening methods for each specific population. The EtD framework is a formalized approach that enables a structured and transparent discussion on 12 criteria (is the problem a priority; how substantial are the desirable anticipated effects; how substantial are the undesirable anticipated effects; what is the overall certainty of the evidence on effects; is there important uncertainty about or variability in how much individuals value the main outcomes; do the desirable effects outweigh the undesirable effects; how large are the resource requirements; what is the certainty of evidence for the resource requirements; are the net benefits worth the incremental cost; what would be the impact on health equity; is the intervention/ option acceptable to key stakeholders; and is the intervention feasible to implement). 31 Recommendation statements were developed that were subsequently voted on anonymously via touchpads. If 75% of participants voted 4 (agree) or 5 Table 3.National Comprehensive Cancer Network Criteria for Further Genetic Risk Evaluation 4 Criteria Individuals meeting the revised Bethesda Guidelines Individuals with a family history that meets Amsterdam Criteria Individuals with colorectal (or endometrial) cancer with microsatellite instability or immunohistochemistry consistent with Lynch syndrome Individuals with papillary thyroid cancer that is the cribriform-morular variant, or hepatoblastoma Individuals with a diagnosis of CRC and >10 colorectal adenomas Individuals with a personal history of 20 adenomas Individuals with multiple gastrointestinal hamartomatous polyps or serrated polyposis syndrome Individuals from a family with a known hereditary syndrome associated with CRC with or without a known mutation Individuals with a desmoid tumor, multifocal or bilateral CHRPE CHRPE, congenital hypertrophy of retinal pigment epithelium. (strongly agree) on a scale of 1 to 5 (with 1, 2, and 3 indicating disagree strongly, disagree, and uncertain, respectively), a statement was then accepted. Once accepted, the \"strength\" of the recommendation (strong vs conditional) was determined based on 4 components: (1) QoE, (2) benefit-to-harm balance, (3) patients' values/preferences, and (4) resource requirements. 32 When the QoE was low or very low, unless at least 1 of the other 3 factors was overwhelmingly strong, the strength of the recommendation would typically default (without a vote) to \"conditional,\" using the phrasing, \"we suggest.\" If the QoE was moderate or high, the statement's strength was determined by an anonymous vote; if 75% of participants voted \"strong, then the recommendation would be designated as \"strong\" and the phrasing was \"we recommend.\"\nThe GRADE approach notes that a conditional recommendation should prompt clinicians to \". . . recognize that different choices will be appropriate for different patients and that they must help each patient to arrive at a management decision consistent with her or his values and preferences,\" whereas a strong recommendation is indicative of a more broadly applicable statement (\"most patients should receive the recommended course of action\"). 32 In accordance with CAG policy, written disclosures of any potential conflicts of interest for the 24 months before the consensus meeting were provided by all participants, reviewed by the CAG ethics committee, and made available to all group members.\n\n# Canadian Association of Gastroenterology Approval and American Gastroenterological Association Endorsement\nThe chair (DL) and 1 of the GRADE methodologists (GL) initially drafted the manuscript, which was then reviewed and revised by the remaining members of the Consensus Group, both individually and jointly during a teleconference.

Please wait.# Rationale and impact\nThese sections briefly explain why the committee made the recommendations and how they might affect practice. They link to details of the evidence and a full description of the committee's discussion.\n\n# Diagnostic testing in primary care\nRecommendations 1.1.1 to 1.1.10\n\n## Why the committee made the recommendations\nAlthough no evidence was available, the committee are confident, based on their knowledge and experience, that albumin-adjusted serum calcium measurement produces an accurate indication of the amount of calcium that is active in the body. Calcium that is bound to albumin is not active and does not have clinical effects. Adjusting for albumin compensates for this, and allows better identification of the active calcium that may be causing symptoms or signs.\nLimited evidence, and the committee's experience, suggest that hypercalcaemia in primary hyperparathyroidism is associated with particular symptoms, notably thirst, frequent or excessive urination, or constipation, and with conditions such as osteoporosis, fragility fractures or renal stones. Diagnostic testing is therefore indicated for people with these symptoms or conditions. However, the committee noted that hypercalcaemia is often asymptomatic and agreed that an incidental finding of elevated albumin-adjusted serum calcium in a person without symptoms should also trigger diagnostic testing.\nNoting that people with primary hyperparathyroidism sometimes have chronic non-differentiated symptoms, the committee agreed that diagnostic testing could be considered for people with these symptoms. Examples include fatigue, depression, mild confusion, anxiety, irritability, insomnia or digestive problems. The committee acknowledged that there could be multiple causes for these symptoms and that their association with primary hyperparathyroidism is uncertain.\nThe committee agreed that ionised calcium should not be measured because point-of-care testing is not subject to the stringency of laboratory testing and the sample has to be handled very quickly, making ionised calcium measurement unreliable.\nBecause serum calcium levels can vary with changes in blood pH or serum albumin, and the cost of measurement is relatively low, the committee agreed that albumin-adjusted serum calcium should be measured at least twice before moving on to more expensive measurement of parathyroid hormone (PTH).\nNo evidence was available on measurement of PTH in the diagnosis or assessment of primary hyperparathyroidism. The committee based their recommendations on the normal reference range for albumin-adjusted serum calcium as defined by the Association of Clinical Biochemistry, which is 2.2 to 2.6 mmol/litre, and their own experience.\nThe committee noted that most people with primary hyperparathyroidism have an albumin-adjusted serum calcium level above 2.6 mmol/litre. However, they also discussed a type of primary hyperparathyroidism that affects a smaller number of people, in which the albumin-adjusted serum calcium level is within the normal range. This is known as 'normocalcaemic primary hyperparathyroidism' and it often goes unrecognised. To address this, the committee added a lower criterion of 2.5 mmol/litre (with clinical suspicion of primary hyperparathyroidism) for PTH measurement.\nThe committee were in agreement that PTH measurement can be done at any time of day. Although there is a marginal diurnal difference, it is not enough to need adjusting for. They agreed that the PTH measurement needs to be interpreted in the context of a concurrent albumin-adjusted serum calcium measurement. They also agreed that there is no benefit in repeating the PTH measurement in primary care.\nThe committee noted that PTH levels can vary widely from one individual to another, and that there is uncertainty about the level of PTH at which primary hyperparathyroidism can be ruled out. The reference range for PTH differs between laboratories so the committee were unable to specify numerical PTH thresholds.\nThe committee agreed, based on their experience, that advice from a specialist with expertise in primary hyperparathyroidism should be sought if:\nPTH is above the midpoint of the reference range and primary hyperparathyroidism is suspected, because these features indicate that primary hyperparathyroidism is likely\nPTH is below the midpoint of the reference range but albumin-adjusted serum calcium is raised, because this indicates that primary hyperparathyroidism cannot be ruled out.\nIf PTH is below the midpoint of the reference range and albumin-adjusted serum calcium is not raised, the committee agreed that primary hyperparathyroidism is unlikely.\n\n## How the recommendations might affect practice\nThe committee expects that these recommendations could lead to a change in practice for some providers. There may be an increased demand for primary care services (such as appointments or blood tests) as a result of increased awareness of symptoms such as thirst, frequent or excessive urination, or constipation. Repeating albumin-adjusted serum calcium measurements will increase the number of such tests but can be expected to reduce the number of PTH tests.\nImplementing a standardised sequence of diagnostic tests should lead to more rapid diagnosis, and reduce the need to manage complications of undiagnosed primary hyperparathyroidism such as fractures, renal stones and chronic long-term symptoms.\nReturn to recommendations\n\n# Testing and assessment in secondary care\nRecommendations 1.2.1 to 1.2.3\n\n## Why the committee made the recommendations\nNo evidence was available on measuring vitamin D to assess primary hyperparathyroidism, so the recommendation is based on the committee's knowledge and experience.\nThe committee noted that vitamin D deficiency can lead to a rise in PTH level, exacerbate bone disease and increase postoperative risk. It is therefore important to assess and correct vitamin D for people with primary hyperparathyroidism. However, the committee were aware that vitamin D testing is not available to all primary care providers, and that waiting for vitamin D to be measured, and corrected if necessary, before seeking specialist advice could delay diagnosis. They therefore concluded that vitamin D measurement and correction are best carried out in secondary care.\nThe committee agreed that it is important to exclude familial hypocalciuric hypercalcaemia (FHH) because it needs no operative treatment. Evidence showed that the 3 tests recommended are equally accurate in the diagnosis of FHH. The committee were not able to recommend thresholds for these measurements because the evidence is inconsistent.\nThe committee agreed that baseline assessment will help to determine optimal management in secondary care. They did not recommend phosphate measurement because improvements in PTH assays have reduced its usefulness.\nThe committee acknowledged the potential of bone turnover markers to enable earlier and more accurate diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism but were unable to make a recommendation because of a lack of evidence. They therefore made a research recommendation on bone turnover markers.\n\n## How the recommendations might affect practice\nMeasuring vitamin D in secondary care is expected to be a change in practice for some services. Current practice varies, partly because of the varying availability of vitamin D measurement in primary care. In primary care services where vitamin D measurement is available, vitamin D is being measured and deficiencies corrected before PTH is measured. By standardising practice and reducing delays in diagnostic testing, the committee expects improvements in the diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism and more prompt treatment for people with the condition.\nMeasuring urine calcium excretion in secondary care is current practice.\nReturn to recommendations\n\n# Referral for surgery\nRecommendations 1.3.1 and 1.3.2\n\n## Why the committee made the recommendations\nThere was no evidence available on surgery compared with non-surgical treatment for people with a confirmed diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism and symptoms or other indications for surgery. However, the committee reasoned that the lack of evidence is likely to reflect the broad consensus that surgery is beneficial for these people. The committee also agreed that surgery is cost effective because, although the initial cost is high, it can be expected to result in a cure and eliminate the need for further treatment. It relieves symptoms of hypercalcaemia such as thirst, polyuria and constipation, and can prevent future adverse events such as renal stones and fragility fractures. Non-surgical treatment, such as calcimimetics, is an ongoing cost with no curative benefit.\nFor people with a confirmed diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism but no symptoms or indications for surgery, the committee based their recommendation on limited evidence together with their clinical experience. They noted that surgery has shown benefits for this group. Although specific symptoms of primary hyperparathyroidism are absent, people in this group can experience non-specific symptoms such as fatigue, depression or muscle weakness that affect their quality of life. Furthermore, future decrements in quality of life and events associated with end‑organ damage may occur. Therefore surgery can be considered as a means of resolving non-specific symptoms and avoiding further deterioration in health.\nThe committee acknowledged the potential of bone turnover markers to help identify people who could benefit from surgery but were unable to make a recommendation because of a lack of evidence. They therefore made a research recommendation on bone turnover markers.\n\n## How the recommendations might affect practice\nThe recommendations are broadly in line with current practice. It is uncertain how many additional surgeries will be performed as a result of the recommendation to consider surgery for people without symptoms or signs, but the committee do not anticipate a significant increase in the number of referrals for surgery.\nReturn to recommendations\n\n# Surgical management\nRecommendations 1.4.1 to 1.4.14\n\n## Why the committee made the recommendations\nThere was limited evidence on preoperative imaging so the committee also used their clinical knowledge and experience to make the recommendations. They agreed that the purpose of preoperative imaging is to help guide the surgical approach. It is not essential in all circumstances (for example, if a decision has already been made to perform 4‑gland exploration).\nEvidence suggested that ultrasound scanning is accurate in identifying abnormal parathyroid tissue. Ultrasound scanning is widely available, safe and does not involve any exposure to radiation. However, the committee noted that the accuracy of ultrasound depends on the expertise of the person performing it. They therefore recommended sestamibi as an alternative.\nAlthough dual scanning using 2 different imaging modalities has the advantage of providing both anatomical and functional information, the committee agreed that a second imaging modality is only needed if it will further inform the surgical approach. Evidence suggests that sestamibi scanning is accurate in detecting single-gland disease. The committee did not make a recommendation on 4D CT scanning because there was no evidence available.\nThe committee agreed that if dual scanning fails to identify an adenoma or is discordant, further imaging will not add useful information and will expose the person to unnecessary radiation. They acknowledged that preoperative imaging does not detect all adenomas, so 4‑gland exploration should be offered if preoperative imaging does not identify an adenoma.\nThe committee agreed that, based on their experience, people whose preoperative imaging does not identify a single adenoma will more frequently have multigland disease and will benefit from 4‑gland exploration. If the first-modality and second-modality scans are discordant, 4‑gland exploration can be considered because the specific anatomical location of the adenoma cannot be assured.\nFor people with a single adenoma, a small amount of evidence shows that both focused parathyroidectomy and 4‑gland exploration are safe and effective. The committee agreed that focused parathyroidectomy offers the potential advantages of lower temporary hypocalcaemia, a shorter surgery time and minor cosmetic benefit. However, it also carries a marginally (around 5%) higher chance of recurrence or persistent disease. They therefore agreed that people with a single adenoma should be offered a choice of focused parathyroidectomy or 4‑gland exploration, and that the possible benefits and risks of each type of surgery should be discussed with them.\nThere was limited evidence on intraoperative PTH (IOPTH) monitoring. The committee noted that in their experience, there is a marginal benefit with the use of IOPTH, but this could be partially attributed to surgical expertise.\nIOPTH monitoring is costly and its effectiveness in improving surgical outcomes is uncertain. The committee agreed that their experience together with the limited evidence did not support IOPTH monitoring as part of standard practice.\nBased on their knowledge and experience, the committee agreed that people who have had parathyroid surgery can be considered biochemically cured if their albumin-adjusted serum calcium and PTH levels are within the reference range before discharge after surgery and their albumin-adjusted serum calcium level is within the reference range 3 to 6 months after surgery.\nThe committee acknowledged the potential of bone turnover markers to check bone health after surgery for primary hyperparathyroidism but were unable to make a recommendation because of a lack of evidence. They therefore made a research recommendation on bone turnover markers.\nThere was no evidence on further surgical management for people who have had unsuccessful first surgery, and very limited evidence on drug therapy with cinacalcet compared with placebo. The committee agreed that input from a multidisciplinary team at a specialist centre should be sought, noting that repeat parathyroid surgery is relatively uncommon, failure rates are higher than in first surgery and it carries a higher risk. They also made a research recommendation on management after unsuccessful first surgery.\n\n## How the recommendations might affect practice\nThe recommendations for preoperative imaging largely reflect current practice. However, there is variation in the number and type of preoperative tests carried out and the resulting course of action. The committee thought that the recommendations will necessitate changes in practice for some providers. They noted that using a maximum of 2 imaging modalities before surgery would change practice in centres that currently use more than 2 imaging modalities.\nAlthough not widely used, IOPTH testing is most likely to be found in larger centres that are undertaking parathyroidectomies most frequently. The recommendation is expected to lead to changes in practice in these centres.\nThe recommendations on type of surgery are considered to generally reflect current practice. However, in some centres, current practice is not to offer surgery to people if no adenoma is identified on imaging. These recommendations will therefore necessitate changes in practice for some providers.\nThe recommendations on follow‑up after surgery reflect current practice in most NHS centres, so the committee thought that there would be little change in practice.\nThe recommendations on unsuccessful surgery are current practice in many areas.\nReturn to recommendations\n\n# Non-surgical management\nRecommendations 1.5.1 to 1.5.5\n\n## Why the committee made the recommendations\nCinacalcet is the only calcimimetic for which evidence was available. The committee noted that cinacalcet does not directly stop kidney problems or bone loss caused by primary hyperparathyroidism, and that surgery is the only definitive treatment for primary hyperparathyroidism.\nBased on the evidence and their experience, the committee agreed that treatment with cinacalcet could be considered for the purpose of reducing symptoms and lowering the risk of a hypercalcaemic crisis for people who have not had surgery and those for whom surgery has not been successful. The committee agreed that, in their experience, cinacalcet can improve quality of life for people with symptoms of hypercalcaemia and an albumin-adjusted serum calcium level of 2.85 mmol/litre or above. For people with an albumin-adjusted serum calcium level of 3.0 mmol/litre or above, who are more at risk of hypercalcaemic crises, cinacalcet can both improve quality of life and help to prevent hypercalcaemic crises.\nThe committee agreed that treatment-related changes in serum calcium should be managed by basing initiation and continuation of treatment on albumin-adjusted serum calcium level and symptoms. They also agreed that treatment with cinacalcet should be continued if it produces a decrease in albumin-adjusted serum calcium or an improvement in symptoms, because discontinuation is likely to reverse these improvements. The committee noted that there is no evidence for and little likelihood of benefit from cinacalcet for people with normal calcium levels and no symptoms.\nThere was evidence showing that bisphosphonate treatment improves lumbar spine bone mineral density for people with primary hyperparathyroidism. The committee based the recommendation on the NICE technology appraisal guidance on bisphosphonates for treating osteoporosis.\nBased on the evidence and their clinical experience, the committee agreed that bisphosphonates should not be offered to reduce hypercalcaemia in the long term.\n\n## How the recommendations might affect practice\nThese recommendations are considered to be current practice in many areas, and are not expected to lead to major changes in practice.\nReturn to recommendations\n\n# Monitoring\nRecommendation 1.6.1\n\n## Why the committee made the recommendations\nBased on their knowledge and experience, the committee agreed that the risk of recurrent disease after successful parathyroid surgery is very low and therefore it is sufficient to monitor albumin-adjusted serum calcium levels once a year.\nFor people who have osteoporosis, although bone density improves after surgery, skeletal recovery can take some time and needs specialist monitoring. The risk of renal stones decreases after successful surgery, but the residual risk persists and the committee agreed that specialist opinion on monitoring should be sought.\nBased on their clinical experience, the committee agreed that monitoring for people who have had unsuccessful surgery should be the same as for people who have had no previous surgery. Monitoring bridges the gap between first surgery and multidisciplinary review and reassessment in a specialist centre.\nThe committee noted the increased risk of renal stones and fractures in people who have had unsuccessful or no parathyroid surgery. Evidence suggests that around one‑third of people who do not have symptoms or indications for surgery will go on to develop these. The committee agreed that monitoring will ensure that surgery, including repeat surgery, can be offered when needed.\nThe committee agreed that people with multigland disease, or disease that has recurred after successful surgery, have a slightly increased risk of future recurrence and will benefit from specialist endocrine opinion on monitoring.\nFor all people with primary hyperparathyroidism, the committee agreed that there was no evidence to suggest that surgery modifies cardiovascular disease risk or fracture risk, so these should be assessed in line with NICE guidance.\nThe committee noted the limited evidence on long-term outcomes and made a research recommendation on long-term outcomes of different management strategies.\n\n## How the recommendations might affect practice\nThe recommendations reflect current practice in most NHS centres, so the committee expects little change in practice.\nReturn to recommendations\n\n# Pregnancy\nRecommendations 1.7.1 to 1.7.6\n\n## Why the committee made the recommendations\nThe committee noted that having surgery for primary hyperparathyroidism before becoming pregnant allows women to start their pregnancy with a normal serum calcium level, which reduces their risk of pregnancy-associated complications of primary hyperparathyroidism. They noted that the risk of stillbirth and neonatal tetany increases with a serum calcium level above 2.85 mmol/litre.\nBased on their experience, the committee agreed that management of primary hyperparathyroidism during pregnancy should be discussed with a multidisciplinary team (MDT) because of the high risk of maternal and neonatal complications.\nThe safety and efficacy of cinacalcet for pregnant women is largely unknown, so the committee agreed that cinacalcet should not be offered during pregnancy. They also agreed that bisphosphonates are potentially harmful for the mother and the fetus.\nThere was no evidence on monitoring for pregnant women. The committee agreed that monitoring should be guided by a specialist centre MDT because of the risk of maternal or fetal complications. They also highlighted primary hyperparathyroidism as a risk factor for pre‑eclampsia and hypertension.\nThere was little overall evidence so the committee made a research recommendation on managing primary hyperparathyroidism during pregnancy.\n\n## How the recommendations might affect practice\nThe recommendations made for women who are pregnant or considering pregnancy might change practice in some areas. However, this is a small population so they are not expected to have a substantial impact on practice.\nReturn to recommendations\n\n# Information and support\nRecommendations 1.8.1 to 1.8.5\n\n## Why the committee made the recommendations\nNo evidence was found so the committee based the recommendations on their knowledge and experience. The committee agreed that primary hyperparathyroidism is an under-recognised condition among both the general population and healthcare professionals. They emphasised the importance of accurate, balanced and up-to-date information so that people with the condition can understand it and make informed choices, particularly with regard to surgery.\n\n## How the recommendations might affect practice\nThe recommendations broadly reflect current practice. They focus on the information and support that should be given rather than on specific interventions and therefore are not expected to change practice.\nReturn to recommendations# Context\nPrimary hyperparathyroidism is a disorder of one or more of the parathyroid glands. The parathyroid gland becomes overactive and secretes excess amounts of parathyroid hormone, causing hypercalcaemia, hypophosphataemia and hypercalciuria. The most common cause of primary hyperparathyroidism is a non-cancerous tumour (an adenoma) in one of the parathyroid glands.\nPrimary hyperparathyroidism is one of the leading causes of hypercalcaemia and one of the most common endocrine disorders. About 1 to 4 people per 1,000 are known to have the condition. Women are twice as likely to develop primary hyperparathyroidism as men. It can develop at any age, but in women in the UK, it is most often diagnosed between the ages of 50 and 60.\nThe signs and symptoms of primary hyperparathyroidism are predominantly brought about by hypercalcaemia and include thirst and increased urine output, gastrointestinal symptoms such as constipation, and effects on the central nervous system such as fatigue and memory impairment. Long-term effects include kidney stones, bone-related complications such as osteoporosis and fractures, and cardiovascular disease.\nThis guideline provides recommendations on recognition, diagnosis and management of primary hyperparathyroidism. It offers advice for primary care professionals on initial diagnostic testing. It also provides guidance for secondary care professionals on indications for surgery, preoperative imaging, types of surgery and follow‑up care after surgery.# Finding more information and resources\nYou can see everything NICE says on primary hyperparathyroidism in the NICE Pathway on primary hyperparathyroidism.\nTo find out what NICE has said on topics related to this guideline, see NICE's webpage on thyroid disorders.\nFor full details of the evidence and the guideline committee's discussions, see the evidence reviews.

{"guideline_text": "Tardive dyskinesia\nFor  patient information click here\n\n# Overview\nTardive dyskinesia is a neurological disorder caused by the long-term or high-dose use of dopamine antagonists, usually antipsychotics. These neuroleptic drugs are generally prescribed for psychiatric disorders. Other dopamine antagonists that can cause tardive dyskinesia are drugs for gastrointestinal disorders (for example metoclopramide) and neurological disorders. Some drugs that are not intended to affect dopamine, such as SSRI antidepressants, may also cause tardive dyskinesia. While newer atypical antipsychotics such as olanzapine and risperidone appear to have less dystonic effects, only clozapine has been shown to have a lower risk of tardive dyskinesia than older antipsychotics.\nThe term tardive dyskinesia was introduced in 1964. Dyskinesia refers to an impairment of voluntary movement. The resultant tics and other movements are often referred to as dyskinesias. Dyskinesia is sometimes caused by long-term use of anti-psychotic drugs or other dopamine antagonists like the antiemetic metoclopramide. The effect of these drugs can be tardive, meaning the dyskinesia continues or appears even after the drugs are no longer taken. As far as treatment of iatrogenic tardive dyskinesia is concerned, neuroleptic drugs should be withdrawn for a period of 3-6 months to see if this resolves the issue, but the problem may fail to improve or may even exacerbate. In this situation, it would be sensible to trial the patient on tetrabenazine 25-50 mg/8h PO.(Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine).\nIn context of Parkinson's disease, dyskinesias are often the result of chronic levodopa (L-dopa) therapy. These motor fluctuations occur in more than half of PD patients after 5 to 10 years of levodopa therapy, with the percentage of affected patients increasing over time.\nDyskinesias most commonly occur at the time of peak L-dopa plasma concentrations and are thus referred to as peak-dose dyskinesias. As patients advance, they may evidence diphasic dyskinesias, which occur when the drug concentration rises or falls.\nThe use of MDMA has been shown to enhance the effects of L-Dopa while reducing the associated dyskinesia in primates with simulated Parkinson's disease.\n\n# Features\nTardive dyskinesia is characterized by repetitive, involuntary, purposeless movements. Features of the disorder may include grimacing, tongue protrusion, lip smacking, puckering and pursing of the lips, and rapid eye blinking. Rapid movements of the arms, legs, and trunk may also occur. Impaired movements of the fingers may appear as though the patient is playing an invisible guitar or piano. Patients with Parkinson's disease have difficulty moving, while patients with tardive dyskinesia have difficulty not moving.\nOther closely related neurological disorders have been recognized as variants of tardive dyskinesia. Tardive akathisia involves painful feelings of inner tension and anxiety and a compulsive drive to move the body. In the extreme, the individual undergoes internal torture and can no longer sit still. Tardive tourettism is a tic disorder that can closely mimic Tourette Syndrome, sometimes to the point where the two can only be distinguished by the details of their onsets.\n\n# Cause\nThe cause of tardive dyskinesia appears to be related to damage to the system that uses and processes the neurotransmitter dopamine. It is thought that postsynaptic dopaminergic receptors become supersensitive to stimulation as a result of the use of neuroleptic drugs and that this supersensitivity causes the symptoms of tardive dyskinesia.  The available research seems to suggest that the concurrent prophylactic use of a neuroleptic and an antiparkinsonian drug is useless to avoid early extrapyramidal side-effects and may render the patient more sensitive to tardive dyskinesia. Since 1973 the use of these drugs have been found to be associated with the development of tardive dyskinesia (Crane, 1973). Since some of the symptoms of tardive dyskinesia can be interpreted as schizophrenia by doctors, they may prescribe additional neuroleptic drugs to treat it, leading to increased risk of more prevalent tardive dyskinesia. Several studies have indicated that long-term neuroleptic use is associated with both cognitive deterioration and atrophy of the brain.\n\n# Differential Diagnosis of Tardive dyskinesia\nOne the basis of stiffness and fever it can be differentiated from:\n- Tetanus\n- Stiff man syndrome\n- Meningitis\n- Hypocalcemia\n- Parkinsonism\n- Neuroleptic malignant syndrome\n\n# Causes\n\n# Treatment\nPrimary prevention of tardive dyskinesia is achieved by using the lowest effective dose of a neuroleptic for the shortest time. If tardive dyskinesia is diagnosed, the causative drug should be reduced or discontinued if possible. Tardive dyskinesia may persist after withdrawal of the drug for months, years, or even permanently. There is no known cure for tardive dyskinesia, but preliminary research suggests that the atypical neuroleptic clozapine (Clozaril®) may improve the state of the patient. Improvements are also seen in some cases, if the high potency benzodiazepines - lorazepam (Ativan®), diazepam (Valium®), or clonazepam (Klonopin®)--are used. The findings about the effects of natural substances, such as vitamin E (Alpha-Tocopherol) or melatonin, are inconclusive.\nNatural remedies are unproven, since they are seldom tested in a controlled setting such as a drug trial. Preliminary research indicates that alternating rest, and regular exercise also negate the symptoms of tardive dyskinesia, necessary for all mental health outpatients who maintain anti-psychotic neuroleptic drug regimes, for on-going 'wellness'. Switching to a newer drug with fewer side effects might be an option for a patient in a controlled or monitored environment.\n\n# Epidemiology\nTardive dyskinesia most commonly occurs in patients with psychiatric conditions who are treated with antipsychotic medications for many years.  Some estimates suggest that it occurs in 15-30% of patients receiving treatment with antipsychotic neuroleptic medications for 3 months or longer. \n“A study being conducted at the Yale University School of Medicine has estimated that 32% of patients develop persistent tics after 5 years on major tranquilizers, 57% by 15 years, and 68% by 25 years.”\nOther estimates suggest that with each year of neuroleptic use, 5% of the patients will show signs of tardive dyskinesia, i.e., 5% after one year, 10% after two years, 15% after three years with no clear upper limit. Eventually, according to these estimates, if on the drugs long enough, the majority of patients will develop the disorder.  The incidence of tardive dyskinesia varies with the type of neuroleptic (e.g., haloperidol (Haldol®) more often than perphenazine (Trilafon®)), daily dose and duration of treatment (the higher the daily dose and the longer the duration of treatment, the higher the risk).\nThe elderly and female patients are more prone to develop tardive dyskinesia. Cigarette smokers also have a higher prevalence of tardive dyskinesia. Children and adolescents are much more sensitive to the early and late extrapyramidal side-effects of neuroleptics than adults. Because of this, treatment of youngsters with neuroleptics may be contraindicated, and many authorities believe that they should be initiated only as a last resort, using the lowest dose regime possible and the shortest duration of treatment in accordance with good patient management.\nTardive dyskinesia can become a social handicap. Patients and/or their families (guardians and/or caregivers/nurses) should receive full information about the neuroleptic before starting treatment (informed consent). The benefits need to be weighed by the individual patient/guardian and their physician.\n\n# Controversy\nPeter Breggin has discussed tardive dyskinesia in the context of his criticism of biological psychiatry.  However, his hypotheses are not widely accepted by mainstream psychiatric professionals.", "source": "wikidoc", "question": "According to authoritative guidelines, discuss a comprehensive clinical approach to preventing, identifying, and managing tardive dyskinesia in a patient receiving long‑term dopamine‑antagonist therapy, including assessment of risk factors, the rationale and process for dose reduction or drug withdrawal, the pharmacologic (including clozapine, benzodiazepines, and other agents mentioned) and non‑pharmacologic treatment options, expected prognosis after drug cessation, and how you would counsel the patient and caregivers."}

Their causative role has been established in some of these diseases but not all. Neuromyotonia is considered to be one of these with accumulating evidence for autoimmune origin over the last few years.

Please read our full disclaimer here.\n\n# Overview\nCarmustine (implant) is an alkylationg agent that is FDA approved for the treatment of high-grade malignant glioma, glioblastoma multiforme.   Common adverse reactions include headache, nausea and vomiting.\n\n# Adult Indications and Dosage\n\n## FDA-Labeled Indications and Dosage (Adult)\n\n### Indication\n- Carmustine is indicated for the treatment of patients with:\n- newly-diagnosed high-grade malignant glioma as an adjunct to surgery and radiation, and recurrent glioblastoma multiforme as an adjunct to surgery.\n\n### Dosage\n- The recommended dose of carmustine is eight 7.7 mg wafers for a total of 61.6 mg implanted intracranially. The safety and effectiveness of repeat administration have not been studied.\n- Following maximal tumor resection, confirmation of tumor pathology and establishment of hemostasis, place up to a maximum of eight carmustines to cover as much of the resection cavity as possible. Should the size and shape of the resected cavity not accommodate eight wafers, place the maximum number of wafers feasible within the cavity. Slight overlapping of the wafers is acceptable. Wafers broken in half may be used, but discard wafers broken in more than two pieces. Oxidized regenerated cellulose (Surgicel®) may be placed over the wafers to secure them against the cavity surface. After placement of the wafers, irrigate the resection cavity and close the dura in a water-tight fashion.\n- Carmustines contain a cytotoxic drug. Follow applicable special handling and disposal procedures.1\n- Each wafer is packaged within two nested aluminum foil laminate pouches. The inner pouch is sterile and is designed to maintain product sterility and protect the product from moisture. The outside surface of the outer laminated aluminum foil pouch is a peelable overwrap and is not sterile.\n- Deliver carmustines to the operating room in their outer aluminum foil pouch, unopened. Do not open the pouch until the wafers are ready to be implanted. Carmustines in unopened outer foil pouches are stable at room temperature for six hours at a time for up to three cycles within a 30-day period.\n- Exposure to carmustine can cause severe burning and hyperpigmentation of the skin. Use double gloves when handling carmustines. Discard the outer gloves into a biohazard waste container after use. Use a dedicated surgical instrument for wafer implantation. If repeat neurosurgical intervention is indicated, handle residual wafers or wafer remnants as potential cytotoxic agents.\n- Instructions for Opening Pouch Containing carmustine\n- Read all steps of the instructions prior to opening the pouch.\n\n## Off-Label Use and Dosage (Adult)\n\n### Guideline-Supported Use\nThere is limited information regarding Off-Label Guideline-Supported Use of Carmustine (implant) in adult patients.\n\n### Non–Guideline-Supported Use\nThere is limited information regarding Off-Label Non–Guideline-Supported Use of Carmustine (implant) in adult patients.\n\n# Pediatric Indications and Dosage\n\n## FDA-Labeled Indications and Dosage (Pediatric)\nThere is limited information regarding FDA-Labeled Use of Carmustine (implant) in pediatric patients.\n\n## Off-Label Use and Dosage (Pediatric)\n\n### Guideline-Supported Use\nThere is limited information regarding Off-Label Guideline-Supported Use of Carmustine (implant) in pediatric patients.\n\n### Non–Guideline-Supported Use\nThere is limited information regarding Off-Label Non–Guideline-Supported Use of Carmustine (implant) in pediatric patients.\n\n# Contraindications\n- Condition1\n\n# Warnings\n- Seizures occurred in 37% of patients treated with carmustines for recurrent glioma in Study 2. New or worsening (treatment emergent) seizures occurred in 20% of patients; 54% of treatment emergent seizures occurred within the first 5 post-operative days. The median time to onset of the first new or worsened post-operative seizure was four days. Institute optimal anti-seizure therapy prior to surgery.\n- Monitor patients for seizures postoperatively.\n- Brain edema occurred in 23% of patients with newly diagnosed glioma treated with carmustines in Study 1. Additionally, one GLIADEL-treated patient experienced intracerebral mass effect unresponsive to corticosteroids which led to brain herniation. Monitor patients closely for intracranial hypertension related to brain edema, inflammation, or necrosis of the brain tissue surrounding the resection. In refractory cases, consider re-operation and removal of carmustines or Wafer remnants.\n- Impaired neurosurgical wound healing including wound dehiscence, delayed wound healing, and subdural, subgleal, or wound effusions occur with carmustine treatment. In Study 1, 16% of carmustine-treated patients with newly diagnosed glioma experienced impaired intracranial wound healing and 5% had cerebrospinal fluid leaks. In Study 2, 14% of carmustine-treated patients with recurrent glioma experienced wound healing abnormalities . Monitor patients post-operatively for impaired neurosurgical wound healing.\n- Meningitis occurred in 4% of patients with recurrent glioma receiving carmustines in Study 2. Two cases of meningitis were bacterial; one patient required removal of the Wafers four days after implantation; the other developed meningitis following reoperation for recurrent tumor. One case was diagnosed as chemical meningitis and resolved following steroid treatment. In one case the cause was unspecified, but meningitis resolved following antibiotic treatment. Monitor postoperatively for signs of meningitis and central nervous system infection.\n- Carmustine migration can occur. To reduce the risk of obstructive hydrocephalus due to wafer migration into the ventricular system, close any communication larger than the diameter of a Wafer between the surgical resection cavity and the ventricular system prior to Wafer implantation. Monitor patients for signs of obstructive hydrocephalus.\n- Carmustines can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Carmustine, the active component of carmustine, is embryotoxic and teratogenic in rats at exposures less than the exposure at the recommended human dose on a mg/m2 basis and embryotoxic in rabbits at exposures similar to the exposure at the recommended human dose on a mg/m2 basis. Advise females of reproductive potential to avoid pregnancy after implantation of carmustines. If the patient becomes pregnant after carmustine implantation, warn the patient about the potential hazard to the fetus.\n\n# Adverse Reactions\n\n## Clinical Trials Experience\n- Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.\n- The safety of carmustines was evaluated in a multicenter, randomized (1:1), double-blind, placebo controlled trial of 240 adult patients with newly-diagnosed high-grade malignant glioma who received up to eight carmustines or matched placebo implanted against the resection surfaces after maximal tumor resection (Study 1).\n- The population in Study 1 was 67% male and 97% White, and the median age was 53 years (range: 21-72). Eighty-seven percent had a Karnofsky performance status ≥ 70 and 71% had a Karnofsky performance status of ≥ 80%. Seventy-eight percent had a histologic subtype of glioblastoma multiforme as determined by central pathology review. Thirty-eight percent of patients received 8 wafers and 78% received ≥ 6 wafers. Starting three weeks after surgery, 80% of patients received standard limited field radiation therapy (RT) described as 55-60 Gy delivered in 28 to 30 fractions over six weeks; an additional 11% received no radiotherapy and the remainder received non-standard radiotherapy or a combination of standard and non-standard radiotherapy. At the time of progression, 12% received systemic chemotherapy.\n- Deaths occurred within 30 days of wafer implantation in 5 (4%) of patients receiving carmustines compared to 2 (2%) of patients receiving placebo. Deaths on the GLIADEL arm resulted from cerebral hematoma/edema (n=3), pulmonary embolism (n=1) and acute coronary event (n=1). Deaths on the placebo arm resulted from sepsis (n=1) and malignant disease (n=1).\n- The incidence of common adverse reactions in carmustine-treated patients is listed in Table 1. The incidence of local adverse reactions is shown in Table 2.\n\n## Postmarketing Experience\nThere is limited information regarding Postmarketing Experience of Carmustine (implant) in the drug label.\n\n# Drug Interactions\nThere is limited information regarding Carmustine (implant) Drug Interactions in the drug label.\n\n# Use in Specific Populations\n\n### Pregnancy\nPregnancy Category (FDA): D\n- Carmustine can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. There have been no studies with carmustine; however, carmustine, the active component of carmustine, is embryotoxic and teratogenic in rats at exposures less than the exposure at the recommended human dose on a mg/m2 basis and embryotoxic in rabbits at exposures similar to exposures at the recommended human dose on a mg/m2 basis. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus.\n- There are no studies assessing the reproductive toxicity of carmustine; however, carmustine, the active component of carmustine, is embryotoxic and teratogenic in rats at intraperitoneal doses of 0.5mg/kg/day or greater when given on gestation days 6 through 15. Carmustine caused fetal malformations (anophthalmia, micrognathia, omphalocele) at 1.0 mg/kg/day (about 0.12 the recommended human dose, eight wafers of 7.7 mg carmustine/wafer, on a mg/m2 basis). Carmustine was embryotoxic in rabbits at intravenous doses of 4.0 mg/kg/day (about 1.2 times the recommended human dose on a mg/m2 basis).

Approximately 60% of the intravenous 200-mg/m2 dose of 14C-carmustine was excreted in the urine over 96 hours and 6% was expired as CO2. Carmustine degrades both spontaneously and metabolically. The relevance of these data to elimination of intracranial implant-delivered carmustine are unknown.\n- Carmustines are biodegradable when implanted into the human brain. Wafer remnants may be observed on brain imaging scans or at re-operation. Wafer remnants were visible in 11 of 18 patients on CT scans obtained 49 days after implantation of carmustine. More than 70% of the copolymer degrades within three weeks. Wafer remnants have been present at re-operation and autopsy up to 232 days after carmustine implantation, and consisted mostly of water and monomeric components with minimal detectable carmustine present.\n\n## Nonclinical Toxicology\nThere is limited information regarding Nonclinical Toxicology of Carmustine (implant) in the drug label.\n\n# Clinical Studies\n\n# How Supplied\n- Carmustine is supplied in a single dose treatment box containing eight individually pouched wafers.

{"guideline_text": "HACEK organism\n\n# Overview\nHACEK organisms is a group of fastidious, slow growing, pleomorphic Gram negative bacilli which form part of the oropharynx commensals and require enhanced carbon dioxide tension for recovery in culture.\n\n# Microbiology\nHACEK refers to the initials of organisms including:\n- Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Aggregatibacter aphrophilus (formerly Haemophilus aphrophilus and Haemophilus paraphrophilus)\n- Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (formerly Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans)\n- Cardiobacterium hominis, Cardiobacterium valvarum\n- Eikenella corrodens\n- Kingella kingae, Kingella denitrificans\n\n# Pathophysiology\nThe pathogenesis of HACEK endocarditis is presumed to be related to colonization of the oropharynx with bacteria that gain access to the vascular space following either trauma or local infection. In addition to valvular infections in the heart, these organisms can also produce other infections such as bacteremia, abscesses, peritonitis, otitis media, conjunctivitis, pneumonia, peritonitis, arthritis and osteomyelitis, and periodontal infections.\n\n# Epidemiology and Demographics\nHACEK organisms account for about 3% of cases of endocarditis,  with an insidious onset and subacute course. They are the most common Gram negative casue of endocarditis among patients who do not use intravenous drugs. Most patients with HACEK endocarditis have preexisting cardiac defects or prior dental manipulations. The duration of symptoms prior to diagnosis is reported to be longer than 2 weeks but shorter than 6 months.\n\n# Diagnosis\n\n## Laboratory Studies\nGiven the fastidious growth requirements, HACEK bacteria are a recognized cause of culture-negative endocarditis. The organisms can be identified after subculture on 5 to 8% sheep blood and chocolate agar at 35 to 37°C for 48 to 72 hours in an aerobic atmosphere containing 5 to 10% CO2. Although the mean duration for incubation of blood cultures until detection of growth is 3 to 5 days, up to 30 days may be required. Biochemical properties are used to differentiate members of the HACEK group. However, biopatterns may be varied by inoculum volume and growth conditions, which prompts the utilization of molecular techniques such as 16S rRNA sequencing.\n\n# Treatment\nThe treatment of endocarditis caused by HACEK organisms should be based on antimicrobial susceptibility tests, including tests for β-lactamase ctivity. Since many of these organisms are slow growing, such tests can be problematic. Although there are limited published clinical data demonstrating the efficacy of ceftriaxone or ampicillin-sulbactam therapy, these drugs should be considered the regimens of choice for the treatment of patients with HACEK endocarditis. Fluoroquinolones should be considered as an alternative agent for patients unable to tolerate β-lactam therapy. The American Heart Association recommends that native-valve and prosthetic-valve endocarditis be treated for 4 weeks and 6 weeks, respectively. HACEK endocarditis is associated with a favorable prognosis, with a cure rate of 82 to 87% of patients with medical treatment alone or associated with surgery.", "source": "wikidoc", "question": "According to authoritative guidelines, outline your approach to diagnosing and managing suspected HACEK endocarditis, including recommended laboratory techniques and incubation times to maximize organism recovery, the role of molecular methods and susceptibility testing (including β-lactamase assessment), first‑line and alternative antibiotic regimens, recommended treatment durations for native versus prosthetic valve infection, and key factors that would prompt consideration of surgical intervention."}

Seguimento.\nlevel of evidence and degree of recommendation adapted from the Brazilian Medical Association/Federal Council of Medicine (AMB/CFM) Guidelines represented in. Note that, in this first part, the ABCG Guidelines will only address issues related to diagnosis, staging, endoscopic treatment and follow-up. The ABCG Guidelines related to treatment itself will be addressed in a future publication. Note that the numbering of the statements is not in sequential order. They were divided according to the topic in question. Thus, many aspects related to diagnosis, staging, treatment and follow-up remain constantly changing. The Japanese Gastric Cancer Association recently published the 5 th English edition of the Japanese Gastric Cancer Treatment Guidelines. In this new edition, some evidence that recently emerged were presented, for instance: the new TNM staging classification of the Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) -8 th edition; the new classification of curability after endoscopic resection, the abandonment of lymph node dissection of the splenic hilus (station nº 10) in D2 lymphadenectomy in total gastrectomy; among others 2 . Furthermore, the Brazilian Gastric Cancer Association (ABCG) recently published the II Brazilian Consensus on Gastric Cancer 7 . In this study, 67 statements regarding the diagnosis, staging, treatment and prognosis of GC were presented to 57 specialists from all regions of the country. The experts were carefully selected considering the notorious knowledge and contribution of each one in the GC field. In this opportunity, the participants responded to the statements with only one possible answer among the alternatives \"I totally agree\"; \"Partially agree\"; \"Undecided\"; \"I disagree\"; \"Strongly disagree\". A consensus was adopted when at least 80% of the sum of the answers \"fully agree\" and \"I partially agree\" was reached. The results were presented at an ABCG event in Porto Alegre (RS).\nAs mentioned in the II Consensus, Brazil is a country with a continental dimension, with many regional peculiarities that directly impact on the diagnosis, treatment and prognosis of GC patients. Therefore, it is pertinent that each region can act in the fight against GC in the best possible way, according to the local reality. Therefore, the aim of this study is to interpret the statements regarding the diagnosis, staging, endoscopic treatment and follow-up contained in the II Brazilian Consensus on Gastric Cancer through a review of the most recent medical literature. Again, it is important to note that the comments contained here are not absolute whatsoever. The idea is to provide new concepts and update old knowledge, which will certainly benefit GC patients. That said, each information presented here must be carefully analyzed and used in the best possible way according to the resources available at your place of work.\n\n# Methods\nDuring the elaboration of the methodology used in the II Consensus, some alternatives were presented in relation to the possibilities of the experts' responses to the statements displayed: the method used in the I Consensus published in 2013 could be repeated, in which there were only two possible answers ( \"yes or no\"); or else, offer the opportunity to the experts to agree wholly or in part, as well as disagree wholly or in part with the statements presented. Both options have already been used in the literature. The second option was chosen, since it can provide a greater amount of relevant information related to GC, when performing the comments presented in this study. In addition, as will be discussed below, there are many possibilities for managing GC, according to the situation in each region.\nTo compose the comments for each statement, the authors used the Medline/PubMed, Cochrane Library and SciELO databases with the following descriptors: gastric cancer, staging, endoscopic treatment and follow-up. Preference was given to more recent articles with better statistical relevance. In addition, each statement was classified according to the OriginAl Article 2/8 negative biopsies collected by upper gastrointestinal endoscopy (including macrobiopsies), the diagnosis can be made through endoscopic resection or surgery. 94% Agreement (level of evidence C; degree of recommendation 2a)\nComment Gastric biopsies must follow the Sydney Protocol (biopsy of the antrum, incisura angularis, small and greater curvature). It generally allows the diagnostic confirmation and the risk assessment for disease development. Anyhow, it is noteworthy that endoscopic mucosal resection or endoscopic submucosal dissection in suspected gastric lesions with dysplasia or early cancer are effective, with a high success rate and low recurrence. Another recommendation is enhanced image upper endoscopy and use of dyes, combined with biopsies is the best approach to accurately detect and stratify GC. Still, in cases where there is a high suspicion of GC, with repeated negative biopsies and highly suspicious imaging exams for GC, diagnostic laparoscopy can be performed 6 .\n\n# Statement 3\nUltrasound upper endoscopy is not indicated when there are clear endoscopic signs that the cancer is invasive. It should be used when there is any doubt about the early aspect of GC. It allows to evaluate the degree of tumor invasion in the gastric wall and the presence of suspicious lymph nodes for metastases. 96% Agreement (level of evidence C; degree of recommendation 2a)\nComment According to a study published by, the ultrasound upper endoscopy is indicated in the following situations: diffuse GC with negative biopsies; to determine the proximal and distal limits of the tumor; for lymph nodes diagnosis; to assess the extent of the lesion and when there is an indication for neoadjuvant chemotherapy, as the method allows lymph node biopsies and ascites analysis (which positivity can modified the strategy adopted). In addition, they conclude that ultrasound upper endoscopy is not useful in T3/T4 tumors diagnosed by computed tomography (CT).analyzed 734 patients treated for GC to assess the agreement between ultrasound upper endoscopy and the pathological result. The agreement was considered moderate (stage T: 52% and stage N: 70%). The accurately estimated risk of invasion was 73%, overestimated in 19% and underestimated in 8%. It may be concluded with this report that ultrasound upper endoscopy should be used with caution and when necessary, always associated with another diagnostic imaging method.\n\n# Statement 4\nThe main staging method is computed tomography of the chest, abdomen and pelvis. 100% Agreement (level of evidence B; degree of recommendation 1) Comment Luo et al. (2017) published a meta-analysis to assess the value of CT in detecting lymph node metastases in GC. There were 27 studies enrolled, with 6,519 patients. They concluded that CT is adequate to assess lymph node metastases in the preoperative stage of serosa positive advanced GC. Nonetheless, it is insufficient to assess serosa negative GC (particularly early GC) due to its low sensitivity. Another meta-analysis corroborated these results, showing that CT is more sensitive than ultrasound and ultrasound upper endoscopy. Another advantage of CT is the possibility of detecting distant metastases (mainly liver and lung) and the possibility to diagnosis peritoneal carcinomatosis.\n\n# Statement 5\nPositron emission tomography (PET-CT) and nuclear magnetic resonance (MRI) should be used only in selected cases. 100% Agreement (level of evidence C; degree of recommendation 2b)\n\n## Comment\nSome studies have shown good results with the use of MRI (positive predictive values, negative predictive values, sensitivities and specificities ranging from 67 to 100%, 71 to 100%, 50 to 100% and 63-100%, respectively). Possibly, MRI would have an added value in detecting lymph node metastases and systemic diseases, in defining the volume of tumors and in predicting treatment response. Still, there is the fact that there is no ionizing radiation emission and yet the benefit for patients allergic to iodinated contrast.analyzed the use of PET-CT in GC staging and demonstrated its limited role in T stage evaluation. Considering its low level of spatial resolution, it provides limited information regarding gastric wall involvement or adjacent organs invasion. It is a method with lower sensitivity than isolated CT in detecting peritoneal lesions. Its sensitivity, specificity and precision for detecting lymph node metastases (N stage) varies from 41 to 74%, 75 to 100% and 51 to 76%, respectively. Whereas contrast CT scans vary from 70 to 83%, 62 to 92% and 67 to 80%, respectively. Possibly, the addition of PET-CT may assist in distant lymph nodes and bone metastases detection, which could significantly influence the treatment. After all, its use should be restricted to selected cases.\n\n# Statement 6\nPET-CT can be used in well-differentiated tumors or in the proximal third. 74% Agreement (level of evidence C; degree of recommendation 2b) Commentevaluated the application of PET-CT in GC staging and found that it is associated with a low detection rate (around 55%), especially in early GC, as well as signet ring cells, mucinous and poorly differentiated adenocarcinomas, which are typically less metabolically active. Well-differentiated tumors may eventually present greater uptake of the radiopharmaceutical fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG-18 F) when compared to undifferentiated tumors. Notwithstanding, the variable and occasionally intense physiological uptake of FDG in the gastric wall is not uncommon and may mask the uptake by the primary tumor. Contrast uptake can often correspond to gastritis. As for proximal tumors, there is a benefit of using PET-CT in cardia tumors (mainly in Siewert's type I and II adenocarcinomas). These tumors have different metabolic and biological behavior from true stomach cancers. In fact, they behave more similarly to esophageal tumors and so, PET-CT can assist in lymph node metastases detection in the chest, which often occur in these types of tumors.\n\n# Statement 7\nStaging laparoscopy should be performed in cases where there is uncertainty in computed tomography regarding the presence of peritoneal carcinomatosis or when multidisciplinary treatment is planned. 98% Agreement (level of evidence C; degree of recommendation 2a)\nComment\nThe staging laparoscopy with peritoneal washing cytology is recommended when CT fails to rule out the possibility of peritoneal carcinomatosis or radiologically occult metastatic disease. Recently, Li et al. (2020) conducted a study comparing CT with diagnostic laparoscopy in hidden peritoneal metastases detection. Among the 385 patients analyzed, diagnostic laparoscopy found hidden peritoneal metastases in 33 (8.5%). The main site was the greater omentum (38.6%), followed by the parietal and perihepatic peritoneum (22.8%). carried out a systematic review with meta-analysis including 240 patients. The authors found that most patients were already in advanced stages, with mean resectability of only 68.7% after staging laparoscopy. The sensitivity was 84.6% while specificity was 100%. Hence, based on the results of this meta-analysis, we can conclude that staging laparoscopy for BrAZiliAn gAStric cAncer ASSOciAtiOn gUiDelineS (PArt 1): An UPDAte On DiAgnOSiS, StAging, enDOScOPic treAtMent AnD FOllOW-UP\n\n## 3/8\nGC is a useful method for detecting peritoneal metastases, with good precision 32 . Currently, a Dutch multicenter prospective study is underway with the goal to compare PET-CT with staging laparoscopy in the preoperative resectable GC patients. The authors of this study hypothesize that there may be a 27% change in the treatment strategy, leading to an important cost reduction.\nIn the era of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC), staging laparoscopy is most needed. Despite great advances in imaging methods, laparoscopy allows a thorough evaluation of the tumor, adjacent organs and the peritoneal cavity. According to a study by, staging laparoscopy added important information in 65% of cases with NAC indication and changed the treatment strategy in 30% of them 8 .\n\n# Statement 8\nPeritoneal washing with oncotic cytology should be performed in all cases during staging laparoscopy and / or surgery. It may be omitted if there is frank peritoneal carcinomatosis. 96% Agreement (level of evidence B; degree of recommendation 2a) Comment Some studies indicate an incidence between 7% and 10% of positive cytology in patients with GC without peritoneal metastases. This situation undoubtedly influences the type of treatment and the prognosis of these patients. In the meantime, peritoneal cytology may be omitted in patients whose lesions have a low risk for peritoneal dissemination (T1/T2, N0). It can also be avoided in those with clear peritoneal disease, in which a biopsy must be collected instead. Conventional peritoneal washing has low sensitivity and immunohistochemical and molecular techniques may be used to increase detection. Negativity cytology must be interpreted according to patient`s disease context and the surgeon`s impression. and 81.8% and for CA 19.9 was 55.0% and 93.7%, respectively. If these markers were elevated prior to surgery, the sensitivity of each marker was greater than 90%. Similar results were found by, in which the sensitivity for recurrence of CEA was 44%, for CA19.9 was 56% and for CA 72.4 was 51%. The combined sensitivity of the 3 markers was 87%. It is interesting to mention that the increase in these markers preceded the clinical diagnosis in most cases. For patients with elevated tumor markers preoperatively, sensitivity was 100%. On the other hand, false elevations of CEA, CA 19.9 and CA 72.4 in disease-free patients were 21%, 26% and 3%, respectively. Thus, the analysis of tumor markers should be performed in a combined manner, but only the CA 72.4 positivity should be considered as a specific indicator for GC recurrence during follow-up.\n\n# Preoperative care statements\n\n# Statement 11\nMultidisciplinary therapeutic planning (surgeon, endoscopist, general clinician, oncologist, radiologist and pathologist) is recommended before starting any type of treatment. 90% Agreement (level of evidence B; degree of recommendation 1) Comment Although there are guidelines directing the therapeutic approach in different stages, the individualities of each patient demand a personalized treatment, adapting the treatment to the patients and tumors features. The association of therapeutic modalities, and the choice of the strategy to be used, require the involvement of several specialists. Therapeutic planning in the form of a multidisciplinary tumor board alters the diagnosis formulated, and the treatment planned when compared to a single physician in 18 to 27%, and in 23 to 41%, respectively. There are no randomized studies, yet there are prospective studies and systematic review acknowledging the contribution of multidisciplinary planning in the therapeutic decision of patients with gastric GC.\n\n# Statement 12\nPatients who had weight lost greater than 10% of their usual weight in the past 6 months should receive some form of nutritional therapy before starting any treatment. 100% Agreement (level of evidence A; degree of recommendation 1) Comment\nThe cachexia in cancer patients is often associated with decreased intake, catabolism, and exacerbated inflammatory response. It affects among 50-80% of patients, accounting for about 20% of deaths. Even with limitations of use as an isolated parameter to assess nutritional status, weight loss greater than 10% in 6 months is indicative of severe malnutrition. In patients with moderate and severe malnutrition, nutritional input is required before any type of treatment, for 7-14 days, in order to reduce morbidity and mortality. Patients initially submitted only to neoadjuvant treatment, also have indication of nutritional therapy, particularly those with food intake below 70% of estimated energy spent.\n\n# Staging statements\n\n# Statement 10\nCurrently, the staging that must be adopted is the UICC/ AJCC TNM 8 th edition. 100% Agreement (level of evidence A; degree of recommendation 2a)\n\n## Comment\nThe gastric cancer staging system, mainly with regard to the evaluation of the lymph node involvement (N), has undergone numerous changes in the last 20 years. The adoption of the numerical, quantitative system is due to the fact that it is simpler to be adopted in different centers of the world and has high precision. The last update of TNM -UICC / AJCC, 8th. edition, is consistent with the Japanese Gastric Cancer Association staging system, widely used in the East, and corrects the imperfections and disparities in the survival curves of stages IIIB and IIIC that existed in the 7th edition, since there was no separation between lymph node involvement between 7 and 15 and with more than 15 lymph nodes. Therepresents the TNM 8 th edition final staging.IIIC IIIC\n\n# Statement 18\nThe UICC / AJCC recommends a minimum of 15 harvested lymph nodes to allow correct staging. 92% Agreement (level of evidence B; degree of recommendation 2b)\n\n## Comment\nThe AJCC / UICC classification recommends at least 16 LN for correct lymph node staging analysis. In fact, some studies have shown the potential benefit of extended lymphadenectomy in this regard.found that limited lymphadenectomy (less than 16 LN removed) is associated with inadequate staging in 54.4% of patients. On the contrary, these rates decreased to 6.2% and 1.4%, respectively, in patients undergoing more extensive lymphadenectomy (D2 or D3), which are associated with adequate disease staging in most cases.\n\n# Statement 19\nD2 lymphadenectomy recommends at least 25 harvested lymph nodes. 76% Agreement (level of evidence B; degree of recommendation 2b) Comment\nThe lymphadenectomy does not concern the number of lymph nodes, but the locations (stations) dissected. This methodology for guiding the removal of lymph node stations is based on results of lymph node involvement studies in various types of tumor (location, degree of tumor penetration into the gastric wall and histological type), associating it with the survival observed according to the dissection pattern. Respecting this standardization, it is unlikely that the number of LN removed in D2 lymphadenectomy will be less than 25. In 2011, a new Japanese guideline was published to coincide with the standard AJCC/UICC TNM classification. The type of lymphadenectomy started to be considered depending on the type of gastrectomy to be performed (total or subtotal) .\n\n# Statement 20\nIt is recommended at the end of each operation that a member of the surgical team send the surgical specimen for the pathological analysis with all the separate and identified lymph node stations. 90% Agreement (level of evidence C; degree of recommendation 2b) Comment\nThe wrong analysis of the number of lymph nodes removed after GC surgery can impair the correct staging for the presence of lymph node metastasis. This would certainly have a significant impact on the prognostic assessment and strategic formulation of adjuvant therapy. Under the premise of standard D2 lymphadenectomy, the number of lymph nodes collected depends mainly on the procedures that will examine the lymph nodes. Despite the fact that the current staging system consider only the number of lymph nodes involved, sending to the pathological evaluation the whole specimen, without dissection of the lymph node stations, could difficult this analysis, and furthermore, diminishes the quality of the surgery itself.\n\n## Endoscopic treatment statements statement 13\nEndoscopic resection is indicated in well-differentiated adenocarcinoma tumors, restricted to the mucosa (T1a), less than 2 cm in its longest axis and not ulcerated. 100% Agreement (level of evidence B; degree of recommendation 1) Comment These are tumors whose recommendation for endoscopic treatment is supported by the main medical societies involved in the treatment of early GC, including the International Gastric Cancer Association, due to low risk of lymph node metastasis, and high survival rates, similar to those achieved by standard gastrectomy. It presents as a potential advantage over surgical treatment, due to the possibility of a less invasive curative approach. However, it requires accurate endoscopic and histological diagnosis, and experienced professionals to perform the procedure. Despite this recommendation is widely accepted, there are no randomized studies, and the current recommendations are based on non-randomized and retrospective studies.\n\n# Statement 14\nEarly lesions with invasion of the submucosal layer, ulcerated, diffuse type and larger than 2 cm are exception criteria for endoscopic resection and should be adopted only in patients at high surgical risk. 92% Agreement (level of evidence B; degree of recommendation 2b) Comment\nThe risk of lymph node metastases, incomplete resections, and recurrences make the above characteristics exception criteria for endoscopic resections. The endoscopic approach in these situations does not reproduce the results of radical surgical treatment, and should be reserved for peculiar situations, such as in patients who do not present performance for surgical treatment or refuse standard treatment. In the event of adoption of this approach, the need for exhaustive multidisciplinary discussion is emphasized, full clarification and agreement of the patient are mandatory, because the chance of complications, in such endoscopic procedure is not negligible, including perforations, which may result in possible surgical indication 2,29,30 .\n\n# Statement 15\nEndoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) is recommended as the treatment of choice for most superficial gastric tumors. 76% Agreement (level of evidence B; degree of recommendation 2a)\n\n## Comment\nThe submucosal dissections offer a higher probability of complete resections, excisions in a single fragment, obtaining free margins, and results in lower risk of recurrences than mucosal resections, especially in cases of tumors greater than 1cm. However, these are procedures of greater complexity than mucosal resections, and the risk of complications, especially perforations, is higher. They require high cost specialized instruments and the time necessary for performing such procedures is longer. Still, it represents a treatment modality with high curative potential, when formal clinical indications are observed (including cancer restricted to the mucosa non-ulcerated, regardless of tumor size, cancer restricted to the mucosa ulcerated maximum of 3 cm in diameter and cancer in the submucosal layer (<500 mm of the muscularis of the mucosa maximum of 3 cm in diameter non-ulcerated, all of the intestinal type and well differentiated.) In these situations, the possibility of lymph node metastases in early GC is practically nil.\n\n## Follow-up statements statement 62\nPatients with metastatic gastric cancer who have not responded to palliative chemotherapy or in poor clinical conditions, should receive only palliative care with best support of care. 96% Agreement (level of evidence C; degree of recommendation 1) Comment \"Primum non nocere\" (first, do not harm). In cases of patients with metastatic GC who do not respond to palliative chemotherapy or in poor clinical conditions, the goal of treatment is not to achieve a cure. It is essential to know when to stop. The medical assistant should seek to relieve symptoms, prevent complications and try to prolong life without impairing the quality of life 1 .\n\n# Statement 63\nPatients undergoing radical surgery or after adjuvant therapy should not be followed due to the high cost and because there is no evidence that the follow-up improves survival. 18% Agreement (level of evidence C; degree of recommendation 3)\n\n## Comment\nThe periodic clinical follow-up of patients undergoing radical gastric surgery for GC is the subject of much controversy.\nBrAZiliAn gAStric cAncer ASSOciAtiOn gUiDelineS (PArt 1): An UPDAte On DiAgnOSiS, StAging, enDOScOPic treAtMent AnD FOllOW-UP\n\n## 5/8\nThat is because the treatment options for relapse historically have always been very limited and also because there are no randomized trials that confirm the usefulness of follow-up. In 2012, the Italian Study Group on Gastric Cancer held a 3-month debate entitled \"Rationale and limits of oncological follow-up after gastrectomy for cancer\". This discussion involved 32 authors from 12 countries, including Brazil. Substantial differences emerged between the participants: authors from Japan, South Korea, Italy, Brazil, Germany and France perform routine followup with serial examinations, while authors from Eastern Europe, Peru and India do not. British and American surgeons carry out surveillance in a very limited way or in experimental studies. In addition to the physical examination, performance status, weight, tomography, endoscopy and laboratory tests are used, including tumor markers are requested. With the progressive increase in clinical and surgical therapeutic options for recurrence, this topic has been recently discussed. A propensity-score match analysis showed that standardized follow-up significantly increased overall survival. This work also suggests that imaging tests and relapse treatment were associated with better outcomes. In addition, this study recommends CT scans periodically, especially in the first three years. In fact, the possibility of recurrence is usually concentrated in the first 3 years in more than 90% of cases 9 .\nOther reasons for carrying out this postoperative follow-up are the possibility of diagnosing early and late gastrectomy complications; psychological support and surveillance of nutritional aspects of these patients.\n\n# Statement 64\nPatients submitted to radical surgery can be followed through abdominal ultrasound, due to its accessibility and low cost. 38% Agreement (Level of Evidence C; degree of recommendation 3)\nComment No evidence is available comparing imaging modalities performance in the diagnosis of recurrence during follow-up though. Nonetheless, the lack of efficacy regarding abdominal ultrasound in diagnosing some of the most common relapse sites of GC, such as peritoneal, regional and distant lymph nodes, or even small hepatic nodules, should be taken under consideration. Therefore, abdominal ultrasound should not be recommended routinely for GC follow-up 4 .\n\n# Statement 65\nIn the postoperative period of patients submitted to radical surgery, the upper endoscopy is indicated when there is clinical suspicion of recurrence and digestive symptoms. 78% Agreement (level of evidence C; degree of recommendation 2a)\nComment The local recurrence in GC patients treated with adequate resection margins and lymph node dissection is not common. It is reported in up to 10% of patients from multicentric trials, such as the Dutch Trial. In the long term, among patients who had a subtotal gastrectomy, a recent Japanese study identified 5% risk of new tumors in the gastric stump. Although these are not very high numbers, they justify the performance of upper endoscopy as a strategy for GC patients follow-up. Two questions remain though: the time interval between each exam and its use among patients who underwent a total gastrectomy. There is no conclusive evidence on these questions. The most recent guidelines recommend and upper endoscopy one year after surgery and every two years after that. Regarding the use of upper endoscopy after a total gastrectomy, it could be implied that it would be more relevant for patients with tumors located in the cardia/fundus 2,41 .\n\n# Statement 66\nThe long-term follow-up should be offered to patients undergoing radical surgery or after the end of adjuvant therapy for nutritional and psychological control and support, early detection of recurrence, treatment of complications and data collection. 100% Agreement (level of evidence B; degree of recommendation 2b) Comment The main reason for monitoring patients operated for GC is the early diagnosis of recurrence, which usually occurs in the first 2 years after surgery with a curative intention. Of these patients, about 2/3 will have recurrence during followup. Despite the limited potential for treating recurrence, even when diagnosed early, other aspects influence the periodic surveillance of these patients. Among them, the treatment of complications related to gastrectomy, nutritional support, psychological support, diagnosis of other possible tumors, improvement in quality of life, data collection for institutional assessment of treatment outcomes 23 (see statement 63 for more information).\n\n# Statement 67\nThe attempt of surgical resection in patients with single local recurrence and low surgical risk can be considered in selected cases. 98% Agreement (level of evidence C; degree of recommendation 3)\n\n## Comment\nThe laparotomy with curative intent is an option for those patients with inadequate resections (for instance: positive gastric margin, immediate postoperative with gross macroscopic nodal disease, D0/D1 lymphadenectomy and local lymph node relapse). Few reports exist showing well succeed resection of local or liver recurrence. Mostly more disease than anticipated is found or resection is abandoned due to safety issues. The procedure should be reserved for patients with good clinical status 28 .\n\n# Discussion\nThe statements conception that forged the II Brazilian Consensus on Gastric Cancer by ABCG was the subject of great debate (in the good sense of the word) among its authors. This is because some of the authors considered that the consensus should be succinct and concise and, therefore, with fewer statements. However, the understanding and perception of all forms of approach and management of GC require wide discussion. As previously mentioned extensively, the disease is complex and with different forms of behavior. In addition to this characteristic, is the fact that there is great social inequality in our country, causing enormous variability in the availability of human, diagnostic and technological resources between the different regions. For this reason, the simple adoption of foreign guidelines does not correspond to the needs found, requiring the positioning of ABCG for the best practices in our scenario.\nHence, it was decided to build up the II Consensus composed of sufficient statements that could cover the different aspects of GC as fully as possible. However, publishing only the results could raise doubts about how would be the best way to manage a patient with GC according to each local reality. In fact, among the 67 statements performed, there was 100% agreement in just 10 (15%). Some aspects are still cause for much discussion among specialists, such as the routine use of drains in GC surgery, the role of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, the best form of surgical approach in cardia tumors, among others. Thus, the ABCG's main goal was to provide arguments based on the literature that could somehow support, or not, the guidelines contained in each statement. This will allow each professional to, as far as possible, offer adequate and effective treatment to the patient with GC.\nOn the other hand, the literature review carried out on each statement made the II Consensus somewhat extensive. Therefore, it became opportune to publish the Brazilian Gastric Cancer OriginAl Article\n\n## 6/8\nGuidelines in two stages. In this first part are the statements regarding the diagnosis, staging, endoscopic treatment and follow-up. In the next stage (part 2) will be presented the statements about the treatment itself (surgical and multimodal).\n\n# Conclusion\nThis publication contains comments and guidelines with reference to the diagnosis, staging, endoscopic treatment and follow-up of GC patients found on the II Brazilian Consensus on Gastric Cancer. The guidelines shown here are intended to assist professionals working in the fight against GC with relevant and current information, allowing them to be applied in daily medical practice.", "source": "pubmed", "question": "According to authoritative ABCG guidelines, outline a stepwise diagnostic and staging approach for a patient with an endoscopically suspicious gastric lesion but repeated negative mucosal biopsies, explaining when to use enhanced-image endoscopy and dyes, when diagnostic endoscopic resection (EMR/ESD) is appropriate for diagnosis, the role and indications for endoscopic ultrasound, the indications for staging laparoscopy with peritoneal washing, and how these results should guide the decision between endoscopic therapy, neoadjuvant treatment, or surgery."}

Please wait.# Rationale and impact\nThese sections briefly explain why the committee made the recommendations and how they might affect practice.\n\n# Information and support for people having surgery\nRecommendation 1.1.1\n\n## Why the committee made the recommendation\nEvidence from studies using patient focus groups and face-to-face interviews showed that people place a high value on having information that is consistent and available when they need it. Patients in these studies stressed the importance of knowing who to contact if they have concerns or queries, particularly after discharge. The studies also illustrated how people's information needs change before, during and after surgery, with some postoperative patients reporting difficulty recalling information given to them before surgery. The committee agreed that their experience reflects the evidence. They also noted that people who feel well informed about their surgery and recovery are less anxious than those who do not.\nThe committee concurred that their recommendation, together with the recommendations in the NICE guidelines on patient experience in adult NHS services and care and support of people growing older with learning disabilities cover the information and support needed by adults during perioperative care.\n\n## How the recommendation might affect practice\nIn larger hospitals the point of contact could be a specific team member such as a clinical nurse specialist. In smaller units the point of contact may need to be a team of people. The point of contact may change as people's needs change throughout the stages of perioperative care. In current practice the amount, availability and sources of information for people having surgery all vary. This recommendation is not expected to lead to major changes in practice.\nReturn to recommendations\n\n# Enhanced recovery programmes\nRecommendations 1.2.1 and 1.2.2\n\n## Why the committee made the recommendations\nThere was a large body of evidence showing that hospital stays are shorter, postoperative complications less frequent and overall costs lower when people having elective major or complex surgery follow an enhanced recovery programme (ERP).\nThe committee agreed that, for optimum effectiveness, an ERP should span the preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative stages, so recommended that components covering all 3 stages be included. They acknowledged that the specific components of an ERP depend on the type of surgery so did not make recommendations detailing the particulars of these components.\nThere is no evidence on the effectiveness of ERPs in emergency surgery, but the committee thought they might be beneficial and made a recommendation for research on enhanced recovery programmes.\n\n## How the recommendations might affect practice\nAccording to the Perioperative Quality Improvement Programme (PQIP) 2017/2018 annual report, 61% of patients enrolled in the PQIP were following an ERP. The report noted that the use of ERPs varies across specialties and hospitals. To implement this recommendation, specialties and hospitals that do not currently provide an ERP covering all 3 stages of perioperative care for patients having major or complex elective surgery will need to restructure their surgical care. This might have an initial resource impact, although some features of an ERP, such as early mobilisation and early intake of food and fluids, are current practice in many hospitals. Introducing an ERP can be expected to reduce the length of hospital stays and the incidence of complications, thereby reducing overall costs.\nReturn to recommendations\n\n# Preoperative care\nRecommendations 1.3.1 to 1.3.11\n\n## Why the committee made the recommendations\nValidated preoperative risk stratification tools are freely available and can be completed rapidly. Although no risk stratification tool is 100% accurate, the evidence showed that validated tools are sufficiently accurate to be a useful supplement to clinical assessment.\nThe committee noted that a validated risk stratification tool can also help to frame discussions about risk with the person having surgery. This includes changes the person can make to reduce their risk, such as stopping smoking. The committee agreed that the risk of postoperative morbidity is an important concern for people when they are making decisions about surgery.\nPreoperative optimisation clinics for older people are designed to reduce complications and deaths associated with surgery by proactively addressing risk factors identified during the preoperative assessment. These clinics are not available in all areas and are expensive to establish. Although a small number of studies suggested a possible improvement in surgical outcomes, the evidence was inconclusive. The committee decided that, because of the high cost and lack of clear evidence, they could not make a recommendation on these clinics. However, they agreed that this is an important area and made a recommendation for research on preoperative optimisation clinics for older people.\nOral iron supplements are usually taken daily but some people have unpleasant side effects from daily iron. The committee thought that, for these people, switching to an alternate-day regimen should be considered as a means of reducing side effects and encouraging adherence. They noted that an alternate-day regimen does not address problems with tolerability or absorption, and the potential benefits need to be balanced against the risk that an alternate-day regimen might be more complicated for people taking multiple daily medicines. There was no evidence on the comparative effectiveness of daily and alternate-day oral iron regimens.\nIn all of the studies, iron supplementation had been started about 3 weeks before surgery. In current practice, this varies. There were no studies that compared different starting times, so the committee were unable to determine the best time to start iron therapy before surgery.\nThe committee made a recommendation for research on oral iron supplementation.\nPeople who take a vitamin K antagonist are at high risk of venous thromboembolism or stroke and therefore, it is usual practice to provide bridging anticoagulation during surgery with either subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) or intravenous unfractionated heparin (UFH). No clinical evidence was identified comparing LMWH with UFH in this high-risk group of patients. The committee noted that people who take a vitamin K antagonist with a target international normalised ratio (INR) of more than 3 and who need bridging therapy are a small proportion of the population taking vitamin K antagonists, and that many of these people have mechanical heart valves. Because of the lack of evidence, the committee made a recommendation for research on managing anticoagulation treatment for people taking a vitamin K antagonist who need bridging therapy.\nNo evidence on nutritional assessment was available. The committee noted that nutritional deficiency contributes to reduced physiological resilience, which is associated with increased complications and perioperative mortality. Because of this, they agreed that preoperative nutritional screening is useful for people having intermediate, major or complex surgery.\n\n## How the recommendations might affect practice\nPreoperative risk stratification tools are commonly used in current practice and the recommendation is not expected to change practice.\nThe option to consider switching from a daily to an alternate-day regimen might increase adherence to oral iron therapy in people who have unpleasant side effects from daily iron. This has the potential to reduce the need for blood transfusions and improve surgical outcomes for this group of people.\nPreoperative nutritional assessment for intermediate, major or complex surgery is current practice and the recommendation is not expected to lead to changes in practice.\nReturn to recommendations\n\n# Intraoperative care\nRecommendations 1.4.1 to 1.4.9\n\n## Why the committee made the recommendations\nSome evidence showed that drinking water until 2 hours before surgery reduces postoperative headaches, nausea and vomiting. The committee noted that many patients are not aware of this and that there is a widespread belief that fluids should be avoided before surgery. They agreed that there was sufficient evidence to recommend drinking clear fluids before surgery, and that the benefits should be explained to patients.\nThere was not enough evidence to justify the routine use of preoperative carbohydrate drinks for most types of surgery. A small amount of evidence suggested reductions in postoperative thirst and headache in people given a carbohydrate drink before surgery. However, the evidence did not show any substantial benefits in terms of patient satisfaction or the occurrence of other side effects.\nThe committee noted that people having major abdominal surgery may need longer postoperative fasting periods and therefore might benefit more than others from preoperative carbohydrate drinks. Some evidence also suggested that length of hospital stay after major abdominal surgery is reduced in people given a preoperative carbohydrate drink. For these reasons, the committee agreed that carbohydrate drinks could be considered for people having this type of surgery.\nThere was no evidence on the best time to give preoperative carbohydrate drinks or clear fluids, so the committee made a recommendation for research on preoperative carbohydrate drinks.\nA small amount of evidence suggested a possible reduction in mortality when intravenous crystalloid, rather than colloid, is used for intraoperative fluid management. However, there was also evidence showing that crystalloids resulted in a clinically important increase in nausea and vomiting. The committee were aware that crystalloid use has become more common after reports of increased risks of acute kidney injury, coagulopathy and mortality with colloid. They also noted that crystalloid is less expensive than colloid. They concluded that crystalloid should be considered for intraoperative fluid maintenance.\nOlder evidence suggested that cardiac output monitoring reduces some complications. However, the relevance of this evidence to current practice was unclear because of subsequent improvements in perioperative care such as better preoperative risk assessment and advancements in surgical techniques. More recent evidence also supported the use of cardiac output monitoring to reduce complications, but this evidence was from 1 small study. The committee agreed that cardiac output monitoring should be considered on a case-by-case basis.\nThere was no evidence that tight blood glucose control in hospital improves outcomes for people with type 2 diabetes or those without diabetes. In addition, there was evidence suggesting that tight blood glucose control increases episodes of hypoglycaemia. The committee therefore concluded that tight blood glucose control is not necessary for people in these 2 groups.\nEvidence showed that using the World Health Organization (WHO) surgical safety checklist (SSC) reduces complications and mortality. Although the SSC is mandatory in NHS practice, the committee were aware from their experience that completion of the checklist varies. They reasoned that the occurrence of preventable 'never events' could be associated with this variation in completion of the SSC. They therefore decided to make a recommendation to highlight the importance of completing the SSC.\nIn the committee's view, reducing 'never events' should be a primary focus of surgical safety checklists. They agreed that adding steps to the SSC could help to achieve this and should be considered whenever relevant events are reported.\n\n## How the recommendations might affect practice\nCurrent clinical practice on allowing oral fluids before surgery varies, with some services offering carbohydrate drinks before surgery, some allowing clear fluids until 2 to 4 hours before surgery, and others advising people to fast from midnight before surgery. The committee noted that more centres are moving away from traditional preoperative fasting regimens and using the more liberal regimen of clear fluids up to 2 hours before surgery. This recommendation is expected to increase the number of services adopting more liberal regimens.\nThe use of intravenous crystalloid for intraoperative fluid maintenance reflects current practice and is not expected to result in a change in practice.\nThe recommendation on cardiac output monitoring reflects current practice and is not expected to lead to major changes in practice.\nBlood glucose control varies in current practice, although there has been a shift away from tight control because of concerns about hypoglycaemic events. The recommendation is expected to change practice in services that still use tight blood glucose control for people with type 2 diabetes or without diabetes. It may also prevent operations being cancelled unnecessarily on the basis of blood glucose levels.\nThe recommendations are expected to reinforce use of the SSC in current practice. Modifying the SSC to address risks highlighted in national patient safety alerts and 'never events' reports, is expected to reduce the number of preventable 'never events' that occur.\nReturn to recommendations\n\n# Postoperative care\nRecommendation 1.5.1\n\n## Why the committee made the recommendation\nThe committee agreed that people with a high risk of complications or mortality should have postoperative care in a non-ward-based specialist recovery area to improve outcomes such as quality of life and to reduce the incidence of adverse events. However, they noted that there is a large group of people in whom the need for postoperative care in a specialist recovery area is less clear, and made a recommendation for research on specialist recovery areas.\n\n## How the recommendation might affect practice\nThe recommendation is expected to lead to a need for increased capacity and staff in hospitals performing major or complex surgery, or surgery in patients with a high risk of complications or mortality. The resource impact for the NHS is likely to be significant because of the high cost of care in specialist recovery areas and the large number of patients likely to need this care. However, there may also be savings achieved by reducing the occurrence of postoperative adverse events and the need to manage these.\nReturn to recommendations\n\n# Managing pain\nRecommendations 1.6.1 to 1.6.13\n\n## Why the committee made the recommendations\nBased on their experience, the committee agreed that people having surgery should be informed of the options for pain management and be actively involved in choosing their own pain management whenever possible.\nThe committee agreed, based on their experience, that multimodal analgesia provides more effective pain relief and reduces the need for opioids and the occurrence of opioid-related complications. They also agreed that prescribing pre‑emptive analgesia should be considered to ensure that pain is managed when local anaesthesia wears off.\nSome evidence suggested that paracetamol used alongside opioid analgesia reduces the amount of opioid needed to manage pain. The committee therefore agreed that paracetamol is beneficial in reducing opioid consumption. There was no evidence showing a significant difference in effectiveness between oral and intravenous paracetamol. Intravenous paracetamol is much more expensive so the committee did not recommend it for people who can take oral medicines.\nThe evidence showed that NSAIDs provide effective additional pain relief, reducing the amount of other types of analgesia needed. Traditional NSAIDs are more cost effective than COX‑2 (cyclo‑oxygenase‑2) inhibitors, and oral ibuprofen is the most cost-effective traditional NSAID. There was no evidence showing a significant difference in effectiveness between NSAIDs or routes of administration. Intravenous NSAIDs are more expensive so the committee did not recommend them for people who can take oral medicines.\nThere was no evidence showing a significant difference in effectiveness between oral and intravenous opioids. Intravenous opioids are more expensive so the committee did not recommend them for people who can take oral medicines.\nFor people who cannot take an oral opioid, the committee agreed that a choice of PCA (patient-controlled analgesia) or epidural should be offered because there was no evidence favouring either mode of administration for most people having surgery. An exception is the group having major or complex open-torso surgery, who may benefit from the early pain relief provided by a continuous epidural. The committee pointed out that factors such as patient preference and ability to use a PCA pump effectively should be taken into account when choosing between PCA and continuous epidural. The committee looked at the possible benefits of spinal administration and agreed that there was insufficient evidence to support a recommendation.\nThere was evidence showing that adding intravenous ketamine to an intravenous opioid can reduce both pain and opioid consumption. The committee noted that ketamine has an additive analgesic effect. They agreed, based on their experience, that intravenous ketamine is helpful if an intravenous opioid alone does not provide adequate pain relief, or if the person is opioid sensitive (abnormal pain sensitivity). Based on the evidence and their experience, the committee agreed that a single dose of 0.25 mg/kg to 1 mg/kg should be considered in these situations.\nEvidence showed that a single dose of gabapentin can lessen postoperative pain and reduce the amount of opioid needed. However, the studies used a range of doses and administered the gabapentin at different times, so the optimal dose and timing of administration remain uncertain. The committee therefore made a recommendation for research on single-dose gabapentin.\n\n## How the recommendations might affect practice\nThe committee noted that pain management is usually planned during a preoperative assessment. Although preoperative assessments are standard in current practice, actively involving the person in decisions about their pain management may lead to a small increase in staff time required.\nA multimodal approach is current practice and the recommendation is not expected to change this.\nThe recommendations can be expected to result in cost savings by reducing the use of intravenous paracetamol. They are also expected to lead to dose reductions in opioid analgesia, resulting in fewer side effects from opioid consumption.\nConcerns about cardiac and renal complications have limited the use of NSAIDs in people having surgery. These recommendations can be expected to change practice by increasing the use of short courses of traditional oral NSAIDs for people having surgery.\nIntravenous opioid administration is often used in current practice because it is perceived to be more convenient and offer better pain relief. The recommendations are expected to lead to a change in this practice, with a reduction in intravenous opioid administration and a concomitant increase in the use of oral opioids.\nPCA and continuous epidurals are used routinely in current practice, although there are variations in their use across services.\nBecause these recommendations are for the perioperative period only, an opiate withdrawal plan is not necessary, but one would need to be considered if opioids were used in the longer term.\nThis recommendation is not expected to lead to major changes in practice.\nThe use of intravenous ketamine in postoperative pain management has increased in recent years. Although ketamine is more expensive than other analgesics, the recommendation is not expected to have a significant impact because it is restricted to a single dose and only one-third of people having surgery are expected to experience moderate to severe pain.\nReturn to recommendations# Context\nApproximately 11 million people have surgery each year in the NHS. Over half are having elective (non-emergency) procedures. Although the standard of care during surgery is high, preventable complications and deaths still occur. Most of these are in high-risk patients, who make up 15% of all patients having surgery.\nPerioperative care is a broad field covering an array of elective and emergency procedures across a varied population. This guideline focuses on aspects of perioperative care where practice varies. It brings together the available evidence and provides recommendations to standardise practice and improve surgical outcomes. It also highlights areas where research is needed to inform future guidance.", "source": "nice", "question": "According to authoritative NICE guidance on perioperative care, discuss the rationale for offering an enhanced recovery programme to adults having elective major or complex surgery, describe the essential components that such a programme should include across the preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative phases, and explain the expected benefits and potential implementation challenges for a hospital introducing these programmes."}
{"guideline_text": "Guideline on the prevention and control of seasonal influenza in healthcare setting\n\n\n\n## Introduction background and purpose\nInfluenza is an acute respiratory disease caused by influenza virus infection. In Korea, epidemic occurs mostly in winter. The characteristic symptoms of influenza consist of abrupt fever, cough, fatigue and other constitutional and respiratory symptoms. Influenza is usually a self-limiting illness without complications, but some patients at higher risk can experience severe complications or die. Influenza is a contagious disease that infects many patients in a short period, so the spread of inf luenza in the community can lead to public health issues or socioeconomic problems.\nInfluenza within a medical institution has a different epidemiology and effects compared to influenza in the community. Medical institutions have high number of visits from influenza patients and wards are crowded with high risk patients. Therefore, there is a high possibility that influenza can spread between patients in a medical institution, and influenza can cause more complications and mortality in this setting. Hence, to minimize the damage from influenza in a medical institution, the effective infection control measures are important to prevent influenza and its spread. The purpose of this guideline is to prevent and control seasonal influenza in a medical institution based on the evidences and current situation in Korea.\n\n## Scope and subjects\nThe subject institutions of the guideline are private clinics, general hospitals, tertiary hospitals, and long term care hospitals. The scope of the guideline is seasonal influenza, and it cannot be applied in the same manner to pandemic influenza or highly pathogenic avian influenza. The epidemiology, clinical symptoms, diagnosis, tests, and treatment of influenza are addressed as an introduction, but the recommendations suggested by the guideline are limited to prevention and control of influenza in a medical institution. Guideline on the use of antivirals other than infection control purposes is discussed in a seperate guidelline [bib_ref] Clinical practice guideline for antiviral treatment and chemoprophylaxis of seasonal influenza, Choi [/bib_ref].\n\n# Method of development\nAs the first step, a guideline development committee was organized consisting of six professionals including infectious disease specialists, an infectious control nurse, and a methodology specialist, so that specialists from multiple disciplines could participate in the development process. The second step was to systematically examine the related guidelines. The influenza related guidelines published from 2009 to 2013, only those in English and Korean were included. The guidelines were limited to those developed by Government or professional associations, and were searched from four databases. The databases and search words are presented in [fig_ref] Table 1: Database and search terms for clinical guidelines [/fig_ref]. The retrieved treatment guide-lines were reviewed by two members of the development committee to select eight treatment guidelines appropriate to the scope of this guideline, and the selected guidelines are presented in [fig_ref] Table 2: Characteristics of selected clinical guidelines AAP, American Academy of Pediatrics [/fig_ref]. The third step was to create a table of contents for the guideline based on the published guidelines. Due to the characteristics of the guideline on the prevention and control of infection, the relevant content was described rather than listing key questions. The fourth step was to construct contents according to domestic and foreign guidelines, related literature searches, and specialist opinions. The level of the recommended items was not ranked, and the recommendations were proposed and composed through discussion by the development NHS, National Health Service.\n\n## Definitions\n\n## Influenza-like illness\nGenerally, influenza-like illness (ILI) is defined as acute respiratory symptoms accompanying fever, and influenza can be suspected when it occurs during influenza season. The case definition used in the influenza surveillance system of the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is a case with sudden-onset fever of 38°C or more accompanied by cough or sore throat.\n\n## High risk groups\nThe definition of high risk groups is slightly different between various clinical guidelines, but the following persons are commonly included [bib_ref] Antiviral agents for the treatment and chemoprophylaxis of influenza. Recommendations of the..., Fiore [/bib_ref] [bib_ref] Seasonal inf luenza in adults and children: diagnosis, treatment, chemoprophylaxis, and institutional..., Harper [/bib_ref].\n\n## Healthcare workers\n'Healthcare workers' used in this guideline is defined as any person who can be exposed to the patients' surrounding environment or have contact with patients, by visiting regularly or residing in a medical institution. This includes staff employed by the medical insti-tution or a related institution to work at the medical institution, students in practical training, trainees, and volunteers.\nExample: doctors, nurses, assistant nurses, medical technicians, pharmacists, administrative staff, clerical staff, students, trainees, facility managers, cooks, central supply department workers, laundry workers, cleaners, security staff, volunteers, etc.\nIn the domestic medical environment, there are many cases where caregivers or guardians of patients reside in the medical institution. Considering this situation, applying the recommendation of this guideline to caregivers and guardians is helpful to manage influenza effectively in a medical institution though they are not employed by the medical institution or related institutions.\n\n## Influenza overview\nInfluenza is an acute febrile illness caused by infection of influenza A or B virus. It is a contagious infectious disease characteristically having an outbreak with an incidence rate of 10% to 40% during an influenza season of 5 to 6 weeks.\n\n## Epidemiology\nIn Korea, an influenza epidemic usually occurs from October to April of the following year, and the peak of the epidemic is usually in December and January. Influenza occurs most frequently in children and adolescents between 5 and 14 years of age. Hospitalization from inf luenza occurs mostly in children aged less than 5 years and the elderly aged 65 years or older, and mortality is highest among the elderly aged 65 years or older. There are no domestic epidemiologic data on influenza, but it is estimated that excess death from influenza and pneumonia is 1.36 to 1.53 per 100,000 population and it is accounts for approximately 1% of the total death.\nThe occurrence of influenza within the medical institution increases during inf luenza season because many influenza patients are hospitalized from community and healthcare workers or visitors also get influenza. Influenza among hospitalized patients is known to occur at a mean ratio of 0.3 to 0.ized patients [bib_ref] Inf luenza surveillance in an acutecare hospital, Weingarten [/bib_ref] [bib_ref] Prevention of nosocomial influenza, Adal [/bib_ref] [bib_ref] Control of inf luenza A on a bone marrow transplant unit, Weinstock [/bib_ref]. In a medical institution where an outbreak of influenza occurs, the attack rate increases to 0.7% to 20%, and it can increase to more than 30% in the ward where the outbreak occurred [bib_ref] Control of inf luenza A on a bone marrow transplant unit, Weinstock [/bib_ref] [bib_ref] A nosocomial outbreak of influenza A, Kapila [/bib_ref] [bib_ref] Nosocomial influenza B virus infection in the elderly, Van Voris [/bib_ref] [bib_ref] Nosocomial outbreak of inf luenza virus A (H3N2) infection in a solid..., Malavaud [/bib_ref] [bib_ref] Influenza in a geriatric unit, Gowda [/bib_ref] [bib_ref] Influenza A virus outbreak in a neonatal intensive care unit, Munoz [/bib_ref]. When an influenza outbreak occurs in a long-term care facility with many elderly patients, the attack rate can increase up to 70% [bib_ref] Prevention and control of influenza A outbreaks in long-term care facilities, Gravenstein [/bib_ref]. In healthcare workers taking care of influenza patients, the attack rate is diverse from 11% to 59% [bib_ref] Nosocomial influenza B virus infection in the elderly, Van Voris [/bib_ref] [bib_ref] Nosocomial outbreak of inf luenza virus A (H3N2) infection in a solid..., Malavaud [/bib_ref]. When aggressive infection control measures were implemented on healthcare workers such as vaccination, reporting and monitoring of respiratory symptoms, and exclusion from work when developing symptoms, the attack rate in healthcare workers was reported to be maintained at less than 2% [bib_ref] Inf luenza in the acute hospital setting, Salgado [/bib_ref].\nThe mortality of influenza occurring in medical institution is diverse according to the characteristics of the patients. The mortality is not high in infants without severe cardiovascular diseases, but the mortality of patients in general hospitals or long-term care hospitals was 16%, and especially, the mortality of intensive care unit patients, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation patients, or acquired immune def iciency syndrome patients is reported up to 33% to 71% [bib_ref] Influenza in a geriatric unit, Gowda [/bib_ref] [bib_ref] Influenza A virus outbreak in a neonatal intensive care unit, Munoz [/bib_ref] [bib_ref] Inf luenza in the acute hospital setting, Salgado [/bib_ref] [bib_ref] Outbreaks of inf luenza A virus infection in neonatal intensive care units, Sagrera [/bib_ref] [bib_ref] Large epidemiological inf luenza a outbreak in a teaching hospital from guatemala..., Mejia [/bib_ref]. Therefore, infection control to reduce inf luenza and its outbreak within a medical institution is very important.\n\n## Transmission\nThe influenza virus is spread through 1) direct contact with a patient, 2) contact with the surrounding environment of a contaminated patient, and 3) inhalation of a droplet that includes the virus. The influenza virus can survive for 5 minutes on a contaminated hand, 8 to 12 hours on contaminated clothing or tissue, and 24 to 48 hours on contaminated metal or plastic. The virus can move onto a hand after staying up to 15 minutes on contaminated clothing or tissue, and up to 2 to 8 hours on contaminated metal or plastic [bib_ref] Survival of influenza viruses on environmental surfaces, Bean [/bib_ref]. In animal models, influenza has been transmitted in close, separated spaces without direct contact with infected animal or its surroundings and outbreak of influenza in confined spaces such as aircrafts have been reported, which suggest the possibility of airborne transmission in certain circumstances When the influenza virus is transmitted, influenza symptoms develop in approximately 50% of patients, and even asymptomatic persons can shed influenza virus. Young adults and middle aged adults are infectious 1 day before the onset of symptoms, and infectivity rapidly decreases at 3 to 5 days after symptoms onset, and 20% to 30% of cases can shed the virus up to 5 to 10 days after the initial day of symptoms [bib_ref] Time lines of infection and disease in human influenza: a review of..., Carrat [/bib_ref]. Young children can spread the virus up to 3 weeks [bib_ref] Nosocomial inf luenza infection as a cause of intercurrent fevers in infants, Hall [/bib_ref]. Use of antiviral agents can decrease the period of viral shedding. In severe influenza patients requiring hospitalization, the ratio of detecting virus RNA 1 week after developing symptoms was 57.1% when antiviral agents were not used, while it was 14.3% when antiviral agents were used within 48 hours of symptom onset [bib_ref] Viral loads and duration of viral shedding in adult patients hospitalized with..., Lee [/bib_ref]. Immunocompromised patients are known to shed the virus for a longer period than healthy people. In elderly patients or patients with underlying conditions, around 30% were confirmed to shed the virus for 1 week or more after developing symptoms. In the 2009 influenza outbreak, prolonged viral shedding for 2 weeks or more was reported in severely immunocompromised patients even when antiviral agents were used.\n\n## Clinical course\nAfter transmission of the inf luenza virus, symptoms occur after approximately 1 to 4 days of a latent period. Around 50% are asymptomatic infections, but there is a higher rate of developing symptoms in children.\nTypical influenza show sudden-onset fever accompanied by cough or sore throat, and there could be systemic symptoms such as lethargy, headache, myalgia, and joint pain, or respiratory symptoms such as cough, sore throat, rhinorrhea, and dyspnea. Gastrointestinal symptoms like diarrhea or vomiting, or ocular symptoms like ocular pain or photosensitivity can also accompany the infection.\nIn uncomplicated influenza, the symptoms usually improve after 3 to 7 days even without treatment, but cough and lethargy can continue for more than 2 weeks. In high risk groups, severe complications can accompany the infection or underlying diseases can worsen (high risk groups; refer to \"Definitions\" section). The most common complication is pneumonia, and other complications such as otitis media, sinusitis and the aggravation of underlying cardiovascular diseases, chronic liver diseases, or chronic renal diseases can be occurred.\n\n## Diagnosis\nWhen ILI develops during influenza season, it can be clinically diagnosed as influenza. When ILI is defined as sudden fever accompanied by cough or sore throat, the positive predictive value is reported to be in the 79% to 88% range in adults in community. Therefore, influenza should be suspected in medical institutions during influenza season when any hospitalized patient has new-onset fever or respiratory symptoms, underlying respiratory symptoms worsen in elderly patients, there are no symptoms other than fever in infant and patients in serious condition with fever or hypothermia.\nLaboratory methods to diagnose inf luenza include rapid antigen test (RAT), reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), serology, and virus culture. RAT and RT-PCR are used in clinical situations where results need to be confirmed quickly. The optimal clinical specimen for children or adults is nasopharyngeal aspirate or swab, and for infants, nasal aspirate or swab [bib_ref] Influenza diagnosis and treatment in children: a review of studies on clinically..., Uyeki [/bib_ref] [bib_ref] Prospective comparative study of culture specimens and methods in diagnosing influenza in..., Schmid [/bib_ref] [bib_ref] Comparative study of nasopharyngeal aspirate and nasal swab specimens for diagnosis of..., Sung [/bib_ref]. Time-wise, detection rate is higher when it is collected closer to the illness onset (within 72 hours). Endotracheal suction and the broncho-alveolar lavage have a high detection rate when a lower respiratory tract infection is accompanied.\nRAT can be used easily in all medical institutions because it is point-of-care testing using the diagnostic kit without any other laboratory equipment and provides results in less than 15 minutes. It has high specificity of more than 90%, but its sensitivity is lower than that of RT-PCR (children 70%-90%, adult < 40%-60%), so it cannot be used as confirmation of a diagnosis [6, [bib_ref] Rapid diagnostic tests for inf luenza, Storch [/bib_ref] [bib_ref] Accuracy and interpretation of rapid influenza tests in children, Grijalva [/bib_ref] [bib_ref] Low sensitivity of rapid diagnostic test for inf luenza, Uyeki [/bib_ref]. RT-PCR has high sensitivity and specificity, so it can be used as a confirmation test. The results can be obtained within 4 to 6 hours when tested in the laboratory of a medical institution, but it may be difficult to obtain prompt results when samples are sent to an external laboratory [bib_ref] Seasonal inf luenza in adults and children: diagnosis, treatment, chemoprophylaxis, and institutional..., Harper [/bib_ref].\n\n## Treatment\nGuideline for antiviral treatment and chemoprophylaxis of seasonal influenza and guideline for treatment of severe influenza have been developed separately [bib_ref] Clinical practice guideline for antiviral treatment and chemoprophylaxis of seasonal influenza, Choi [/bib_ref].\n\n## Prevention and control of influenza in a medical institution\nA multi-faceted effort is required to prevent the occurrence and transmission of influenza within a medical institution. Influenza virus in health care settings can spread through healthcare workers and visitors as well as between patients, so infection prevention and control have to include all people at a medical institution. The basic elements for influenza prevention and control are as follows:\n- Influenza vaccination - Adherence to precautions - Influenza surveillance - Infection control according to the environment and facilities of the institution - Use of prophylactic and therapeutic antiviral agents - Education of patients, guardians, and medical staff Recommendations for each of the above basic elements are presented below.\n\n## Vaccination\nVaccination is the most effective way to prevent influenza. Vaccination on healthcare workers and hospitalized patients is a basic element for preventing influenza outbreak in a medical institution.\nVaccination against seasonal influenza should be undertaken every year before upcoming influenza season. Subjects for vaccination in a medical institution are all hospitalized patients older than 6 months and healthcare workers without contraindications. Especially, for high risk patients such as those mentioned below, who are at higher risk of developing severe or complicated inf luenza, vaccination should be carried out meticulously. And vaccination should be delivered to healthcare workers to minimize the possibility of exposure of influenza to high risk patients. Both inactivated influenza vaccine and LAIV can be used for vaccination at medical institutions, but only inactivated influenza vaccine is recommended for severe immunocompromised patients and for healthcare workers who have close contact with these patients. Inactivated inf luenza vaccine is recommended for patients taking prophylactic antiviral agents for the effect of the live-attenuated influenza vaccination is reduced in these patients.\nFor people who have contraindications or precautions to vaccination (severe allergic reaction such as anaphylaxis to eggs or vaccine components, prior experience of severe fever after vaccination, history of Guillain-Barre syndrome within 6 weeks of a previous inf luenza vaccination), chemoprophylaxis can be considered instead of vaccination. Cell-culture based inf luenza vaccine is planned to be released later. Cell-culture based vaccine is egg-free unlike the existing egg-based inf luenza vaccines. Therefore cell-culture based inf luenza vaccine can be used in patients who have severe allergic reaction to eggs. For the children aged 6 months to 8 years who get influenza vaccine for the first time in their lives, the second dose should be given one month after the first dose to obtain the appropriate immunity.\nVaccination for hospitalized patients Vaccination against seasonal inf luenza is universally recommended to all people older than 6 months. This vaccination strategy is also applied to hospitalized patients in a medical institution.\nFor patients who are suffering from moderate to severe acute febrile illness accompanied by a fever of 38°C or higher, the vaccination might be delayed until the symptoms improve. For patients with moderate to severe acute illnesses without fever, influenza vaccination should be considered cautiously. Vaccination should be undertaken without delay in patients under long term care for chronic illnesses and not acute illnesses.\nPatients admitted during an influenza season should be asked whether they have received an influenza vaccination. Then vaccination should be performed for unvaccinated patients.\n\n## Vaccination for healthcare workers\nInf luenza vaccination to healthcare workers prevents influenza in vaccinee and decreases the subsequent absences. Secondly it reduces the transmission of influenza virus in healthcare settings [bib_ref] The effectiveness of vaccination against inf luenza in healthy, working adults, Nichol [/bib_ref] [bib_ref] Preventing nosocomial influenza by improving the vaccine acceptance rate of clinicians, Salgado [/bib_ref].\nMany patients admitted at medical institutions are at higher risk of developing severe or complicated influenza, therefore vaccination of healthcare workers is strongly recommended since it can reduce inf luenza mortality in medical institutions [bib_ref] Effects of influenza vaccination of health-care workers on mortality of elderly people..., Carman [/bib_ref] [bib_ref] Influenza vaccination of health care workers in long-term-care hospitals reduces the mortality..., Potter [/bib_ref]. Administrative policies are required to deliver vaccination to all healthcare workers without contraindications to vaccination.\nAlthough data regarding vaccination rate of healthcare workers in Korea is limited, reported vaccination rate in university hospitals was 23.0% to 78.0% [bib_ref] The adverse reactions of influenza vaccination in the healthcare workers in a..., Choi [/bib_ref] [bib_ref] Effect of a hospital campaign for influenza vaccination of healthcare workers, Song [/bib_ref]. Considering that the vaccination rate is relatively lower in long-term care hospitals and clinics, the overall vaccination rate of healthcare workers is expected to be lower than reported data. Because vaccination is the key strategy to prevent influenza in healthcare settings, influenza vaccination to all healthcare workers should be encouraged at all medical institutions.\n\n## Adherence to precautions\nInf luenza is usually transmitted through droplet of large particles generated by cough or sneezing of an influenza patient. In some cases, it can spread through smaller aerosols. Droplet can travel less than 1 m, and therefore it is spread by close contact. can also transmit influenza virus from contaminated surfaces to eyes or mouth through hands. Thus, standard and droplet precautions should be implemented. During procedures which generate aerosols, airborne precautions should be followed.\n\n## Adherence to standard precautions\nTo prevent the spread of influenza, all healthcare workers should adhere to standard precautions. Standard precautions are applied to patients potentially infected or colonized with an organism that could be transmitted, and this includes patients with respiratory infections, inclusive of influenza.\nHealthcare workers should perform hand hygiene before and after contact with patient, contact with potential source of infection and wearing personal protective equipment such as gloves. Hand hygiene can be performed using water and soap, or using alcohol hand rub without water. When hand is visibly soiled, they should wash their hands with water and soap. Medical institutions should supply materials for hand hygiene.\nHealthcare workers should wear gloves when they contact potential source of infection, and wash their hands after taking off gloves. Gloves should be changed for each patient, and should not be washed with the purpose of reuse.\nWhen healthcare workers are expected to contact with blood, body f luids and secretions or excretions from respiratory tract or other system, they should wear gown before contact with patients. They should take off their gowns before leaving the patient's surroundings, and then wash their hands. The gown should be changed for each patient.\nAdherence to droplet precautions For previously healthy adult patients they should be isolated for 5 days after symptom onset. When fever continues for more than 5 days, isolation should be maintained until the patient is afebrile for 24 hours or more without any antipyretics. However, in children or severely immunocompromised patients, the viral shedding may be prolonged and isolation period may be extended.\nPatients with suspected or confirmed influenza should be isolated in a single patient room. When single room is not available, the patient should be assigned to the cohort room. Healthcare workers should wear masks when they enter rooms with patients suspected or confirmed influenza. They should take off the mask when leaving the room, dispose it in a medical waste box, and hand hygiene should be followed.\nWhen a patient on droplet precaution moves outside the room, the patient should use a mask and follow respiratory and cough etiquette, and hand hygiene. Transferring department should be informed about the patient with suspected or confirmed influenza.\nPrecautions when performing aerosol-generating procedures Procedures that can generate aerosols such as bronchoscope, sputum induction, tracheal intubation or extubation, autopsy, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation have a risk of exposure to influenza through aerosols, so airborne precaution should be implemented. Only the essential members should be attended, and the procedure should be undertaken by vaccinated personnel.\nProcedures should be performed in negative-pressure rooms, where air ventilation is possible through HEPA filters allowing a minimum of 6 to 12 air changes per hour. The door should be closed all the time. Negative pressure room should be checked to ensure the proper operation of negative pressure.\nThe practitioner performing the procedure should wear gloves, a gown, facial mask or goggles to cover the entire face, and a N95 mask or other respiratory protective equipment with equivalent function with N95 mask. The surface of immediate surroundings should be disinfected following procedure.\n\n## Influenza surveillance\nFor early detection and response to occurrence of influenza within a medical institution, infection control activities are required during the inf luenza season to monitor the occurrence of ILI and to facilitate laboratory tests when ILI occurs. When an ILI occurs in a medical institution, laboratory tests should be actively performed for patient management and prevention of transmission.\nA RAT is performed on patients who have an ILI. When the RAT results are positive in patients who have an ILI during influenza season, additional laboratory testing is not needed. However when the results are negative, RT-PCR can be considered due to the possi- bility of false negative results of RAT. Because the laboratory test for patients who have ILI during influenza season is to manage inf luenza patients and prevent transmission within a medical institution, the use of therapeutic antiviral agents for treatment of individual patients can be considered whether influenza tests are taken or not. However, a diagnostic method for surveillance can be chosen according to the situation of each institution.\n\n## Surveillance during influenza season\nContinual surveillance on the occurrence of ILI in hospitalized patients is necessary during influenza season. Even when hospitalized patients are not showing an ILI during influenza season, influenza should be suspected, and laboratory tests should be performed when there are new symptoms of fever and respiratory symptoms; underlying respiratory illness is aggravated in elderly patients regardless of fever; symptoms do not exist other than fever in child patients, and when patients are in serious condition with fever and hypothermia.\n\n## Surveillance in patients with contact to influenza\nActive surveillance should be performed to monitor the occurrence of ILI or fever in patients who have come into contact with patients suspected or confirmed to have inf luenza, and laboratory tests should be performed for patients who show symptoms. The risk of influenza is highest in patients who have been within 1 m of an influenza patient, and surveillance is needed if inf luenza symptoms occur in patients who use the same hospital room or ward.\n\n## Surveillance during an outbreak in a medical institution\nAn influenza outbreak in a medical institution can be suspected when two or more patients develop acute febrile illness symptoms within 72 hours in a single medical institution, and one of them has laboratory confirmed influenza. The decision of whether it is an outbreak is to be made according to the epidemiologic relationship between the patients.\nSurveillance should be actively performed for the occurrence of ILI or fever in all areas of the medical institution including the areas where the influenza patients have not been, and laboratory testing should be performed for symptomatic patients. Active surveillance should be continued until the end of the outbreak, and active surveillance is to be maintained until 1 week after the occurrence of the last influenza patient.\n\n## Infection control according to the environment and facilities of the institution\nThe entrance of a medical institution It is important to prevent the spread of influenza within a medical institution through early detection of ILI patients. Information posters should be posted in conspicuous positions such as at the entrance and reception desk during inf luenza season, and employees should be positioned to instruct cough etiquette and to provide masks to patients with ILI [fig_ref] Figure 1: Example of a hospital entrance with instruction posters and an information center [/fig_ref]. Patients with ILI should be guided to moving routes which other patients do not use. The moving route should be decided beforehand to prevent confusion.\n\n## Outpatient clinic\n\n## When installation of a quarantine waiting room is possible\nInformation posters should be posted in conspicuous places around the reception desk during influenza season . Reception employees are to instruct cough etiquette to patients with ILI, and lead them to the quarantine waiting room after providing them with masks to wear. In the quarantine waiting room, the patients are to sit more than 1 m away from each other. In addition, movement outside the quarantine area should be minimized to reduce the opportunity of contact with other patients. Tissues should be provided in the quarantine room for patient use when coughing, and trashcans with lids that can be opened without using hands should be provided to dispose of the contaminated tissues. Facilities for hand hygiene and disposable towels should be provided. When there is not enough space for quarantine, a barrier can be used to divide the space. Appropriate ventilation should be provided in the quarantine waiting room and consulting room.\n\n## When installation of a quarantine waiting room is difficult\nInformation posters should be posted in conspicuous places around the reception desk during influenza season to promptly identify patients with ILI [fig_ref] Figure 3: Example of an outpatient clinic which could not install a quarantine waiting... [/fig_ref]. These patients should be instructed of cough etiquette, and lead to waiting room after providing them with masks to wear. Patients are to sit more than 1 m away from each other. Movement should be minimized to reduce the opportunity of contact with other patients. Tissues should be provided in the waiting room for patient use when coughing, and trashcans with lids that can be opened without using hands should be provided to dispose of the contaminated tissues. Facilities for hand hygiene and disposable towels should be provided. Appropriate ventilation should be provided in the waiting room and consulting room.\n\n## Emergency room\nIt is important to prevent spread of influenza within an institution through early detection of inf luenza patients. Information posters should be posted in conspicuous places around the emergency room entrance and reception desk during influenza season [fig_ref] Figure 4: Example of an emergency room with a quarantine area and waiting room [/fig_ref]. A triage area should be installed to question all patients regarding fever and respiratory symptoms.\nMasks should be provided to patients with fever or respiratory symptoms, and a separate quarantine space should be prepared for waiting and treatment. Patients are to sit more than 1 m away from each other. Movement should be minimized to reduce the opportunity of contact with other patients.\nTissues should be provided in the quarantine waiting room for patient use when coughing, and trashcans with lids that can be opened without using hands should be provided to dispose of contaminated tissues. When there is not enough space for quarantine, a barrier can be used to divide the space. Appropriate ventilation should be provided in the quarantine waiting room and consulting room. When hospitalization is decided, the patient should be promptly moved to a ward. Patients with ILI are to wear masks during transfer, and are to wash their hands before moving. Patients suspected of influenza are to be guided to moving routes which other patients do not use. The moving route should be decided beforehand to prevent confusion. Medical staff moving the patient should wear appropriate personal protective equipment.\n\n## Ward\nTo prevent the spread of inf luenza during inf luenza season, patients with ILI should be separated in their placement. In principle, they should be hospitalized in single isolation rooms. However, when there are too many patients and individual isolation is difficult, cohort isolation rooms should be used [fig_ref] Figure 5: Example of operating hospital rooms based on cohort isolation [/fig_ref]. When there are no cohort rooms or they cannot be used, a barrier can be used to separate part of a room. However, precautions should be taken so they are not placed in the same room with high risk patients. The spacing between beds in a cohort isolation room is to be maintained at 1 m or more. The doors to the isolation rooms should be closed, and there should be sufficient external ventilation.\nMasks should be placed at the room entrance, and thorough education is necessary for the proper wearing of masks and washing of hands before entering an isolation ward. Patients suspected or confirmed of influenza should always wear masks, and opportunity for contact with other general patients in the ward should be limited. When movement to the outside the ward is inevitable, the patient should be moved after wearing a mask and washing their hands.\nThere is need to educate and restrict visitors. Surveillance is needed to check for fever and respiratory symptoms in visitors, and hospital visits should be restricted. Visitors should be limited to members who are needed for the care and emotional support of the patient.\n\n## Infection control according to different situations\n\n## Sporadic cases of influenza in hospitalized patients\n\n## Laboratory diagnosis when patients suspected of influenza occur\nDiagnosis of influenza in local community during influenza season consists of mainly clinical symptoms, but laboratory tests should be actively performed for patients suspected of influenza in a medical institution (refer to \"Surveillance during inf luenza season\" section).\n\n## Patient management\nWhen a patient suspected of or confirmed with having influenza occurs,\n\n## 1) adherence to precautions\nThe standard precautions and droplet precaution guidelines should be implemented.\n\n## 2) restriction of movement\nPatients with suspected of conf irmed inf luenza should be restricted from common activities, and they are to stay in individual rooms or cohort isolation rooms.\n\n## 3) administration of antiviral agents for treatment\nAdministration of antiviral agents not only has the effect of treating the influenza patient, but can also reduce the amount of viral shedding and decrease the period of viral shedding. Therefore, antiviral agents should be used actively to treat inf luenza occurring within medical institutions. For details regarding the administration of antiviral agents for treatment, refer to the guideline for using antiviral agents for seasonal influenza [bib_ref] Clinical practice guideline for antiviral treatment and chemoprophylaxis of seasonal influenza, Choi [/bib_ref].\nThe possibility of drug resistant influenza should be considered when influenza occurs in patients administered with antiviral agents for more than 72 hours for preventive purposes and when symptoms do not improve and the virus is continually detected in RT-PCR despite administration of antiviral agents for treatment. When drug resistant inf luenza is suspected or confirmed, the appropriate drug should be selected in consultation with an infectious disease specialist. Patients with suspected or confirmed drug resistant influenza are to be more actively isolated than other influenza patients.\n\n## 4) surveillance and early treatment for influenza in patients exposed to influenza\nSurveillance should be conducted for patients who have been exposed to patients with suspected or confirmed influenza (refer to \"Surveillance in patients with contact to influenza\" section). Prophylactic use of antiviral agent is classified as pre-exposure prophylaxis and postexposure prophylaxis. Pre-exposure prophylaxis can be considered restrictively in persons at high risk of severe complications (e.g, patients at organ transplantation unit or neonatal unit, severely immunocompromised patients) for whom influenza vaccine is contraindicated or expected to have low effectiveness.\nPreventive use of antiviral agents for patients exposed to influenza should be limited to patients at high risk. As an alternative to the preventive use of antiviral agents, prompt administration of antiviral agents for treatment can be started when influenza symptoms occur. For details, refer to the guideline for using antiviral agents for seasonal influenza [bib_ref] Clinical practice guideline for antiviral treatment and chemoprophylaxis of seasonal influenza, Choi [/bib_ref].\n\n## 5) duration of isolation\nDuration of isolation precautions, such as implementing standard precautions and limiting activity area for patients with suspected or confirmed inf luenza is determined by the anticipated period of viral shedding and infectivity.\nIn general, isolation is maintained for 5 days after the onset of symptoms. When fever continues for more than 5 days, isolation can be discontinued only after there has been no fever for 24 hours without the use of antipyretics.\nChildren can shed the virus for a longer period than adults, so the isolation period for children can be ex-tended compared to the general isolation period. Patients with severe immunosuppression can also discharge the virus for several weeks or more even when administered with antiviral agents. There is insufficient research regarding the period of infectivity in such cases. Laboratory tests such as RT-PCR cannot confirm whether infectivity is maintained. However, when viral shedding is continually confirmed in laboratory tests despite administration of antiviral agents, there is a possibility of a drug resistant virus, so the appropriate precautions should be taken before removing quarantine.\n\n## Management of high risk patients exposed to influenza\n\n## Definition of exposure\nExposure is defined as when there was contact within 1 m with patients with suspected or confirmed influenza showing symptoms. There is insufficient research regarding what length of exposure time allows propagation.\n\n## Definition of high risk group\nPersons at high risk for severe or complicated influenza - Children aged less than 2 years and elderly aged 65 years or older - Patients with chronic respiratory disease, cardiovascular disorders (excluding isolated hypertension), chronic renal disease, chronic liver disease, metabolic disorders, hemoglobinopathy, neurologic disorders (neuromuscular diseases, epilepsy, cerebral infarction, cerebral palsy, etc.), and malignancy - Patients taking immunosuppressants or who are at immunodeficiency conditions such as HIV infection - Pregnant women and mothers who gave birth within 2 weeks - Children with long-term aspirin therapy, obesity, residents of long-term care facilities\n\n## Prophylactic use of antiviral agents for high risk patients with influenza exposure\nPostexposure prophylaxis refers to the administration of antiviral agents to subjects who have been exposed to patients with influenza during the season. It was observed that there was a 79% to 81% preventive effect when zanamivir was used in subjects exposed to influenza, and 68% to 89% when oseltamivir was used. phylactic use of antiviral agents in high risk groups can be considered according to the evidence. However, there are issues regarding the cost-benefit, developing strains with resistance to antiviral agents resulting a breakthrough infection, and adverse effects by drugs, therefore it should be used on a case by case basis considering the inf luenza activity and condition of patients. The use of antiviral agents for 10 days after exposure is recommended. Clinical research for prevention after exposure using oseltamivir has been usually conducted as a 7-or 10-day administration. A research using zanamivir was conducted as a 5-or 10-day administration.\nThere have been few researches comparing the duration of prophylaxis for each drug. The prophylactic administration dosage is shown in [fig_ref] Table 3: Dosage of antiviral prophylaxis www [/fig_ref].\nWhen postexposure prophylaxis is not or cannot be offered, education about inf luenza symptoms should be provided and antiviral agents should be prescribed to patients who are observed to be developing flu-like symptom as soon as possible.\n\n## Outbreak\n\n## Definition of an outbreak\nAn outbreak at an institution can be suspected when there is a patient with laboratory confirmed influenza, and an epidemiologically related patient newly develops ILI within 72 hours.\n\n## Management\n\n## 1) adherence to precautions\nThe standard precautions and droplet precautions should be implemented.\n\n## 2) restriction of movement\nPatients with suspected or conf irmed inf luenza should be restricted from common activities, and they are to stay in individual rooms or cohorts.\n\n## 3) vaccination\nInfluenza vaccination should be provided to patients and medical personnel who were not immunized.\n\n## 4) administration of antiviral agents\nThe spread of influenza within a medical institution should be minimized by immediate administration of antiviral agents to laboratory confirmed patients and also to patients with suspected influenza. Prophylactic administration of antiviral agents to all hospitalized patients can result in premature termination of an outbreak [bib_ref] Seasonal inf luenza in adults and children: diagnosis, treatment, chemoprophylaxis, and institutional..., Harper [/bib_ref]. However, the selection of patients and the decision for administration is made by the infection management staff and supervisor according to each outbreak situation and the characteristics of the medical institution.\nProphylactic use of antiviral agent is classified as pre-exposure prophylaxis and postexposure prophylaxis. Pre-exposure prophylaxis can be considered restrictively in persons at high risk of severe complications (e.g., patients at organ transplantation unit, severely immunocompromised patients, neonates at neonatal unit) for whom influenza vaccine is contraindicated or expected to have low effectiveness. Postexpo- sure prophylaxis should be limited to high risk exposers. An alternative to chemoprophylaxis is administrating therapeutic antiviral agent to persons promptly who have developed signs and symptoms of influenza. For healthcare workers who did not or cannot receive a vaccination, prophylactic administration of antiviral agents should be considered. When there are differences between circulating strains and vaccine strains, administration of antiviral agents for all hospital workers can be considered during influenza season. Antiviral chemoprophylaxis can be administered up to 14 days after an outbreak, or up to 7 days from the initial day of the influenza-like symptoms of the last patient.\n\n## 5) active surveillance\nDuring influenza season, surveillance should be performed every day to check for patients with fever and respiratory symptoms. When relevant to influenza-like symptoms, laboratory tests should be performed, and antiviral agents should be administered together with cohort isolation. Active surveillance is continued up to 7 days after the occurrence of the final patient. It should be considered that patients who have neurologic disease may not show the characteristic symptoms or signs of influenza.\n\n## Management and education of subjects excluding patients\n\n## Management of visitors\nVisitors should be limited to only those who are necessary for emotional support and care. Visitors who have had contact with patients with inf luenza can be the source of influenza for other patients, staff and visitors. Visitors should be checked whether they have acute respiratory symptoms before entering the institution or ward.\nVisitors should be educated about hand hygiene, standard and droplet precautions. Visitors are not allowed in areas where procedures generating aerosol are performed, and they should be instructed to minimize their movement within the medical institution.\n\n## Management of caregivers\nIf a caregiver did not receive an influenza vaccination, immunization should be recommended. Hand hygiene should be performed with water and soap, or hand sanitizer before and after contact with patient. Masks should be put on when contact is made within 1 m from patients. Surveillance should be performed to check for symptoms or signs of suspected inf luenza infection, and treatment should be given promptly when suspicious symptoms develop. Symptomatic caregivers should be discouraged from caring of the patient until their symptoms completely improve.\n\n## Management of healthcare workers\nHealthcare workers should receive vaccination for seasonal inf luenza. They should be aware of the symptoms, signs, and complications from influenza, so consultation and early treatment should be received as soon as inf luenza-like symptoms develop. Standard precautions and droplet precautions are to be followed when contacting with inf luenza patients or patients with ILI. Airborne precautions should be implemented when performing aerosols-generating procedures such as tracheal intubation.\n\n## Healthcare workers with suspected or confirmed influenza\nWhen healthcare workers have acute respiratory symptoms during influenza season, they should wear masks immediately and contact with patients should be suspended, and the infected person should report to supervisor. Duties are only to be resumed after confirming that fever is not present for 24 hours or more without the use of antipyretics. When respiratory symptoms remain at the time of returning to work, the symptomatic person should wear masks continually and perform hand hygiene thoroughly.\n\n## Medical staffs who contact with patients requiring a protected environment\nWhen patients with severe immunodeficiency are infected with influenza, there is a high possibility of severe inf luenza, and the duration of viral shedding is also longer despite antiviral treatment. Hence, there is a high risk of influenza transmission and developing of drug resistance, therefore a protected environment is necessary. When workers who come in contact with severe immunodeficient patients with suspected or confirmed influenza, they are to be excluded from duties in the protected environment by changing duties or taking time off. The period being excluded from duties is to be for 7 days after the onset of symptoms. When rewww.kjim.org http://dx.doi.org/10.3904/kjim.2014.29.2.265 spiratory symptoms continue for more than 7 days, the duration is extended until the symptoms disappear.\n\n## Duties of healthcare workers at higher risk for complications\nHealthcare workers at higher risk for complications can be assigned to duties which refrain from exposure to influenza virus (e.g., refrain from procedures which can generate aerosols on patients with suspected or confirmed influenza).\n\n## Environment management\nInfluenza virus is usually spread through droplet while coughing, sneezing, or talking, but it can survive for 1 to 2 days on an environmental surface, and it can spread by contacting an environmental surface contaminated with influenza virus [bib_ref] How long do nosocomial pathogens persist on inanimate surfaces? A systematic review, Kramer [/bib_ref]. However, it is possible to remove with heat at 75°C or higher, chlorine, hydrogen peroxide, iodophors (iodine-based antiseptics), and disinfectants such as alcohol.\nCleaning and disinfection - Cleaners should wear masks and gloves.\n- Surfaces that are frequently touched by patients (doorknobs, bedrails, tables, mattresses, phones, call bells) should be thoroughly disinfected every day and after patient discharge using environmental disinfectant (e.g., degree 4 ammonium agent, chloride based disinfectant [bleach diluted to 1:100]). - Surfaces such as floors and table tops should be cleaned regularly. - Walls, blinds, and window curtains are only cleaned when contamination is visible. - Disinfectant should be not sprayed when cleaning.\n- When blood or other potential infective material is spilled, contaminants should be removed immediately using a spill kit. - Used instruments should be disinfected with disinfectant before using with other patients.\nManagement of linen - It can be washed together with other laundry but take precautions that workers moving the laundry do not contact with the contaminated linen and do not shake the laundry. - Put into a separate bag and seal it within the room. - Wear gloves when moving linen.\n- Wear gloves and a gown when coming in direct contact with contaminated laundry. - Perform hand sanitation after laundry.\n\n## Management of tableware\nPerform mechanical dishwashing with hot water. Washing with hands is not advisable.\n\n# Note limitations\nThis guideline was designed to provide recommendations by searching as many literatures as possible with a systematic literature review. However, there were not many study results which might be used as a basis for the recommendations was particularly insufficient. Therefore, this guideline may need to be revised by continuously conducting relevant studies in the future. In addition, when this guideline is applied to the individual institution, the range of applying this guideline may be dependent on the state of each institution.\n\n## Plan for revision\nUp-to-date results with respect to the recommendations in this guideline will be periodically reviewed every 3 years. The guideline will be revised if there are new research results which may provide an appropriate basis for the recommendations.\n\n## Conflict of interest\nAll the committee members who participated in the development and review of this guideline certify that the financial support did not affect the final recommendation, that no other f inancial support which might affect the development of this guideline was received, and that the committee members were not influenced by any particular interest group.\n[fig] Figure 1: Example of a hospital entrance with instruction posters and an information center.

{"guideline_text": "Retinoschisin\nRetinoschisin also known as X-linked juvenile retinoschisis protein is a lectin that in humans is encoded by the RS1 gene.\nIt is a soluble, cell-surface protein that plays an important role in the maintenance of the retina where it is expressed and secreted by retinal bipolar cells and photoreceptors, as well as in the pineal gland. Retinoschisin (RS1) is encoded by the gene RS1 located on the X chromosome at p22.1. Young males who have an RS1 mutation are susceptible to retinoschisis, and X-linked eye disease which causes macular degeneration and can lead to a loss of vision.\n\n# Function\nRetinoschisin is an extracellular protein that plays a crucial role in the cellular organization of the retina: it binds the plasma membranes of various retinal cells tightly to maintain the structure of the retina. In addition to enabling cell-to-cell adhesion, it has been shown that retinoschisin interacts with the sodium/potassium-ATPase (Na/K-ATPase) which resides in the plasma membrane. RS1 also plays a role in the regulation on intracellular MAP kinase signalling.\n\n# Clinical significance\nPathogenic mutations of this gene are responsible for X-linked retinoschisis an early-onset macular degeneration in males that results in a splitting of the inner layers of the retina and severe loss in vision. Female carriers of the RS1 mutation do not show symptoms of X-linked juvenile retinoschisis, except in rare cases where the non-functional protein is expressed due to anomalous X-chromosome inactivation. In young males who carry a gene mutation, the disease presents itself as retinal cavities, splitting of inner retinal layers (also known as foveal schisis), and defective synapse activity. Retinas that lack mature retinoshisin develop these characteristics in up to 1 in 5,000 males. There are over 200 mutations of RS1 recorded in the Retina International Mutation Database, most of which are not pathogenic.\n\n# Structure\nThe retinoschisin monomer is 224 amino acids long, including a 23-amino acid signal peptide essential for secretion (this is cleaved off before the protein becomes functional), and a highly conserved sequence motif called the discoidin domain which consists of 157 amino acids, important for the protein's function in cell to cell adhesion. However, its oligomeric structure is a pairing of back-to-back octamers, forming a homo16mer . This structure allows it to adhere to the plasma membrane of retinal cells such as bipolar and photoreceptor cells, joining them together.", "source": "wikidoc", "question": "According to authoritative guidelines, discuss a clinician's approach to diagnosing and counseling families with suspected X-linked juvenile retinoschisis due to RS1 mutations, including typical clinical features in affected males and female carriers, the genetic basis and inheritance implications (including anomalous X‑chromosome inactivation), the role and limitations of RS1 mutation testing (given mutation heterogeneity and non-pathogenic variants), and recommendations for family screening and prognosis."}
{"guideline_text": "Brucellosis overview\n\n# Overview\nBrucellosis is an ancient zoonotic disease. It is caused by bacteria of the genus Brucella. It is usually acquired by consuming unpasteurized dairy or undercooked meat products. Patients with brucellosis usually present with undulant fever, night sweats and joint pain. Brucellosis can be easily treated with antibiotics. If left untreated, patients with brucellosis may progress to develop focal organ involvement, relapses or chronic brucellosis. Prognosis is good with treatment.\n\n# Historial Perspective\nAccording to some studies, there is evidence that Brucellosis occurred in animals 60 million years ago and 3 million years ago in human beings. In 450 BC, Hippocrates described a disease similar to Brucellosis.\n\n# Pathophysiology\nBrucellosis is a zoonotic disease. Humans could be infected by eating undercook meat or raw dairy products, inhalation of the bacteria and direct contact of bacteria with skin wounds or mucous membranes. Following transmission, white blood cells phagocyte the pathogen and transports it via hematologic or lymphatic route to different organs, specially to those of the reticuloendothelial system. Endotoxic lipopolysaccharide LPS plays an important role in: survival of bacteria inside monocytic cell, supressing phagosome-lysosome fusion and internalizing bacteria into endoplasmic reticulum.\n\n# Causes\nHuman brucellosis is caused by four Brucellae species: B. abortus, B. canis, B. melitensis, and B. suis..\n\n# Differentiating Brucellosis from other Diseases\nBrucellosis must be differentiated from Typhoid fever, Malaria, Tuberculosis, Lymphoma, Dengue, Leptospirosis, Rheumatic disease, Epstein-barr virus, Toxoplasmosis, Cytomegalovirus, and HIV.\n\n# Epidemiology and Demographics\nWorldwide, the incidence of Brucellosis ranges from a low of 0.01 per 100,000 to high of 200 per 100,000 individuals. Case fatality rate is less than 2% when untreated. Brucellosis most commonly affects men in age group between 20 to 45 years old. Areas currently listed as high risk are the Mediterranean Basin (Portugal, Spain, Southern France, Italy, Greece, Turkey, North Africa), South and Central America, Eastern Europe, Asia, Africa, the Caribbean and the Middle East\n\n# Risk Factors\nCommon risk factors in the development of brucellosis are: consuming unpasteurized dairy products or raw meat products, unsafe hunting practices and occupational risks.\n\n# Screening\nThere are no guidelines for screening Brucellosis.\n\n# Natural history, Complications and Prognosis\nIf left untreated, patients with brucellosis may progress to develop focal organal involvement, relapses or chronic brucellosis. Common complications of brucellosis include: granulomatous hepatitis, arthritis, sacroiliitis, meningitis, orchitis, epididymitis uveitis, and endocarditis. The prognosis of brucellosis is good with adequate treatment.\n\n# Diagnosis\n\n## Principles of Diagnosis\nDiagnosis is based on history of potential exposure, presentation consistent with the disease, and supporting laboratory findings.\n\n## History and Symptoms\nBrucellosis can present with diverse clinical presentation which include systemic flu-like symptoms and symptoms due to focal involvement of organs.\n\n## Physical Examination\nPatients with brucellosis are usually well-appearing. Common physical examination observed include hepatomegaly, splenomegaly and lymphadenopathy.\n\n## Laboratory Findings\nThe diagnosis of brucellosis can be confirmed by either a positive bacterial culture or a positive titre of anti-brucella antibodies on serological testings.\n\n## Other Diagnostic Studies\nThere is no specific X-ray, CT or MRI finding associated with Brucellosis.\n\n# Treatment\n\n## Medical Therapy\nThe mainstay of therapy for brucellosis is antimicrobial therapy. The preferred regimen for uncomplicated brucellosis is a combination of Doxycycline and Streptomycin.  Rifampicin is the drug of choice for brucellosis in pregnancy. For children less than 8 years of age, the preferred regimen is either Gentamycin or a combination of Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and Streptomycin.\n\n## Prevention\nBrucellosis can be prevented by not consuming unpasteurized dairy products or undercooked meat and having safe occupational practices.", "source": "wikidoc", "question": "According to authoritative guidelines, outline your approach to diagnosing and managing an adult patient with suspected brucellosis, including the key historical and examination features that guide testing, the laboratory criteria for confirmation, the preferred antimicrobial regimen for uncomplicated disease and alternative regimens for pregnancy and for children under 8 years, and the main complications and preventive measures you would counsel the patient about."}
{"guideline_text": "Sore mouth infection overview\n\n# Overview\n“Sore mouth” is a viral infection caused by a member of the poxvirus group and is an infection primarily of sheep and goats.\n\n# Differentiating Sore mouth infection from other Diseases\nFoot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is a serious disease that does resemble sore mouth and can affect sheep, goats, cattle, swine, and other \"cloven-hoofed\" animals.  Although FMD has not occurred in the United States since 1929, if there are symptoms you observe in your animals that appear more serious than sore mouth, immediately report it to your veterinarian, to State or Federal animal disease control officials, or to your county agricultural agent.\n\n# Epidemiology and Demographics\nGeographically, “sore mouth” infection is commonly found throughout the world. According to the United States Department of Agriculture Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service's National Animal Health Monitoring System (USDA APHIS NAHMS) 2001 sheep survey, 40 percent of U.S. operations reported sore mouth infecting their flocks in the previous three years.\nSore mouth is generally found only in sheep and goats. Other ruminants that are occasionally infected include musk oxen and gazelles.\n\n# Natural History, Complications and Prognosis\nThe sore may be painful and can last for 2 months. People do not infect other people.  Sores usually heal without scarring.\nAnimals may become infected more than once in their lifetime but repeat infections usually occur after a year's time and are usually less severe.\n\n# Treatment\n\n## Medical Therapy\nCurrently there is no approved treatment for sore mouth. However, the sores may be painful and may become infected with bacteria if not properly managed. If you are experiencing pain, fever, or notice that the sore is becoming rapidly larger or spreading, you should see your primary care provider.", "source": "wikidoc", "question": "According to authoritative guidelines, outline your clinical approach to a flock presenting with oral lesions suggestive of sore mouth, including how you would differentiate it from foot-and-mouth disease, what reporting steps are required, recommended management and supportive care given no approved specific treatment, advice to animal owners about prognosis and recurrence, and indications for veterinary or human medical referral."}
{"guideline_text": "Acute intermittent porphyria\nSynonyms and keywords:\n\n# Overview\nAcute intermittent porphyria (AIP) is a rare metabolic disorder in the production of heme, the oxygen-binding prosthetic group of hemoglobin.  Specifically, it is characterized by a deficiency of the enzyme porphobilinogen deaminase (PBGD) or hydroxymethylbilane synthase (HMBS)\n\n# Historical Perspective\nOne of the many hypothesized diagnoses of the artist Vincent van Gogh is that he and his siblings, particularly his brother Theo, suffered from AIP. Another theorized sufferer was King George III of England, who even had a medallion struck to commemorate his \"curing\".\nAIP makes an appearance on the television show House MD in season 1, episode 22 where Dr. House diagnoses his ex-wife's new husband with the disease.\nIt also makes an appearance on the television show Scrubs in season 4, episode 13 as a difficult to diagnose disease.\nThe TLC documentary drama mini-series, Mystery ER, features a landscaper with AIP who is repeatedly misdiagnosed.\n\n# Classification\nAIP itself is a sub-category of diseases of broad group of disease describes as Porphyria.\n\n# Pathophysiology\nAIP is an autosomal dominant disease with variable penetrance and expression. It is caused by variable mutation in gene encoding PBGD; it was earlier known as uroporphyrinogen I synthase.  PBGD is present in hepatocytes as well Red Blood Cell.(RBC). It works in cytosol and converts porphobilinogen to porphobilingen deaminase. The PBGD is expressed in two forms depending on weather it is being expressed in hepatocytes or RBC. The manifestation of AIP typically occurs when production of PBGD is diminished or there is lack of expression gene encoding PBGD in hepatocytes. PBGD enzyme deficiency alone is rarely symptomatic. The disease precipitates in the setting of another co-existing mutation as decrease in production of  delta-aminolevulinic acid synthase (ALAS1) or in the presence of other precipitating factor as mentioned below.\n\n# Causes\nGenetic Causes: The most commonly seen precipitating factor is co-existence of deficiency of ALAS1 because of mutation in gene encoding ALAS1.\nDrug Causes:  The drugs which can precipitate AIP consist of following categories as described in the table.\nIn females with AIP, attacks can be seen during luteal phase when progesterone levels are significantly elevated.\n\n## Contraindicated Medications:\nThe following medication are contraindicated with patients who have had a prior episode of AIP.\nBarbiturates, Carbamazepine, Carisoprodol, Danazol, Diclofenac, Estrogen, Griesofulvin, Mebrobamate, Phenytoin, Phenobarbital, Primidone, Progeterone, Pyrazinamide, Rifampin, Sulfonamide, Valproate.\n\n# Differentiating Acute intermittent porphyria from other Diseases\nThe classical presentation of AIP is abdomen pain associated with other gastrointenstinal symptoms of nausea, vomiting, constipation and rarely diarrhea.\nIn patients presenting with severe abdominal pain, pancreatitis should be ruled out by checking serum lipase and CT scan of abdomen. Also, other common etiologies such as hepatitis, acute gastroenteritis should be ruled out before considering AIP.\nOther associated symptoms are neuropsychiatric manifestation of seizure, sensory loss, agitation, anxiety, hallucination, insomnia along with cardiac mainfestation of hypertension  tachycardia. Other findings in some cases are respiratory paralysis, fever, generalized myalgia. Diagnosis of AIP is rare and should be pursued in the setting of high suspicion.  When suspicion is high, urine porphyrins should be the first test of choice to be done.\nIn the setting of elevated urine porphyrins and abdomen pain, other possibility could be lead poisoning or hereditary tyrosinemia type 1 is possible.\nIn the setting of neurospychiatric manifestation and seizures, other differential which should be ruled out is Guillian-Barre syndrome, Herpes simplex virus encephalitis, lead poisoning, alcohol abuse, neurodegenerative diseases, paraneoplasituc syndromes, hyponatremia, infectious causes, drug abuse, and psychiatric illness.\nElevated levels of urinary prophobilinogen points towards diagnosis of AIP and further testing in this diagnosis should be pursued. If urinary prophobilinogen is normal and index of suspicion is high; then plasma poprhyrins level should be checked. If plasma poprhyrins comes out to be normal. AIP should be ruled out. If plasma porphyrins level comes out to be elevated, further testing with plasma and fecal porphyrin should be done and this helps in differentiating types of porphyria.\n\n# Epidemiology and Demographics\nAge: AIP manifests in the age group of 30-50 years but isolated case report have been reported prior to puberty and in the elderly as well.\nGender: The mutation is equally present in male and females. But, disease manifests more in the females in view of estrogen and progesterone being a natural risk factor for AIP.\nRace: AIP is seen in all the races. Yet, more commonly in people of Northern European descent.\n\n# Risk Factors\nThe presence of mutation of gene PBGD in association with exposure to the medication mentioned above and co-existence of mutation or deficiency in ALAS1 is known to precipitate AIP.\nStarvation and decreased intake of carbohydrate rich food can also exacerbate or precipitate AIP frequently.\n\n# Natural History, Complications and Prognosis\nNormally, heme synthesis begins in the mitochondrion, proceeds into the cytoplasm, and finishes back in the mitochondrion.  However, without PBGD, a necessary cytoplasmic enzyme, heme synthesis cannot finish, and the metabolite porphyrin accumulates in the cytoplasm. Most of the disease mainfests as AIP and isolated episodes. Some of these patients progress to chronic AIP.\n\n### Complications:\nPatients living with chronic AIP present with intermittent attacks of AIP. These patients are prone to develop systemic hypertension, acute kidney injury, chronic kidney disease.\nPatients with age more than 50 and chronic AIP should be screened annually for hepatocellular carcinoma.\nPatients having prolonged attacks can end up having respiratory paralysis requiring mechanical ventilation.\nRegular treatment with hemin can cause iron overload in patients and thus routine follow up of serum ferritin level is advised. In case serum ferritin level is elevated, phlebotomy is advised to prevent iron overload and its complications.\n\n### Prognosis:\nThere is no definite data regarding prognosis in AIP. A majority group of AIP remains undiagnosed and asymptomatic throughout there life. Patients who are managed well and they stay away from exacerbating factors have a good prognosis. When mortality occurs, it occurs mostly during the first episode of AIP or the subsequent episode.\n\n# Diagnosis\n\n## Diagnostic Criteria\nThere is no specific diagnostic criteria established for AIP. A high index of suspicion in patients presenting with constellation of symptoms of abdominal pain, gastrointestinal symptoms and neusopsychiatric manifestations; urine porphobilinogen should be first test of choice.\n\n## Symptoms\nThe classical presentation of AIP is abdomen pain associated with other gastrointenstinal symptoms of nausea, vomiting, constipation and rarely diarrhea. Abdomen pain is the most common presentation, and most of the time it is excruciating associated with cramping, nausea and vomiting. But, it is not important for all symptoms to be present in every patient. Generalized pain involving chest, back, abdomen and extremities are also present in patients with AIP.\nOther associated symptoms are neuropsychiatric manifestation of seizure, sensory loss, agitation, anxiety, hallucination, insomnia along with cardiac mainfestation of hypertension, tachycardia. Some cases present with respiratory paralysis, fever, generalized myalgia. Some of these patients come with complaint of red colored urine or hematuria.\nPatients who experience frequent attacks can develop chronic neuropathic pain in extremities as well as chronic pain in the gut.  This is thought to be due to axonal nerve deterioration in affected areas of the nervous system. Some cases of chronic pain can be difficult to manage and may require treatment using multiple modalities. Depression often accompanies the disease and is best dealt with by treating the offending symptoms and if needed the judicious use of anti-depressants. Patient having chronic AIP are more predisposed to develop depression and chronic pain as well.\n\n## Physical Examination\nPatients  with AIP present with hypertension, tachycardia, and occasionally respiratory distress.\nThe most common finding is of abdominal tenderness. Occasionally finding of abdominal distention along with decreased bowel sounds suggestive of ileus is also seen.\nPatients presenting with neuropychiatric manifestation of seizures are confused and stigmata of seizure such as tongue bite, frothing, urinary or fecal incontinence can be seen as well. Confusion, altered mental status, psychosis, agitation and hallucnination is also seen.\n\n## Laboratory Findings\nComplete blood count is essentially normal or close to normal in a patient with AIP.  Presence of abnormalities suggests of an alternative diagnosis.\nThe comprehensive metabolic panel shows hyponatremia in view of SIADH in some patients. Also, hypomagnesemia and hypercalcemia are occasionally seen. Liver transaminase is mildly elevated as well but synthetic functions of the liver are essentially normal. Elevated urea and creatinine can be seen in some patients who present with acute kidney injury or having chronic AIP showing Chronic kidney disease.\nPlasma aminolevulinic acid (ALA) and porphobilinogen (PBG) levels are elevated during AIP attacks. These should be checked when the suspicion is high.\nPBGD activity is decreased in Red Blood Cells in the active phase as well as the asymptomatic phase of AIP.\nDNA testing can be done to look for a mutation in PBGD to confirm the diagnosis of AIP, although it is not always required.\nUrine PBG is increased up to 20 to 200 mg/day in AIP; whereas the normal level is approximately 0 to 4 mg/day. Urinary ALA and porphyrins excretion are also increased. It is important to note that isolated urinary porphyrins excretion is non-specific and non-diagnostic of AIP.\nFecal porphyrins levels are normal or slightly elevated in AIP.\n\n## Imaging Findings\nCT scan and X-ray of abdomen may show distended bowel loops suggesting of ileus. Symptomatic management of ileus would be advised in these patients.\nMRI Brain may reveal findings consistent with posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome. Neurology consultation would be beneficial in these patients.\n\n## Treatment\n\n## Medical Therapy\nSymptomatic Management: A high-carbohydrate diet is typically recommended; in severe attacks, a glucose 10% infusion is recommended, which may aid in recovery. If drugs have caused the attack, discontinuing the offending substances is essential.\nInfection is one of the top causes of attacks and requires vigorous treatment.\nPain is extremely severe and almost always requires the use of opiates to reduce it to tolerable levels. Pain should be treated early as medically possible due to its severity.\nNausea can be severe; it may respond to phenothiazine drugs but is sometimes intractable. Hot water baths/showers may lessen nausea temporarily but can present a risk of burns or falls.\nSeizures, agitation, and psychosis should be managed with benzodiazepines. As mentioned above, most of the anti-epileptics exacerbate the symptoms of AIP.\nFocused Management:  Hemin is used for treatment of AIP in the United States whereas heme arginate is used in the United Kingdom. Early administration of hemin or heme arginate can shorten the attack effect and duration of AIP. But, these provide symptomatic relief only and not curative. These inhibit ALA synthase, thus preventing of accumulation toxic precursors.\nHemin is a rarely used medication. In case a new diagnosis of AIP is made, the patient should be referred to centers capable of managing AIP or The American Porphyria Foundation should be contacted for quick procurement of the hemin.\nPrior to administration of hemin, patients should be given carbohydrate loading of 400 gm/day of glucose for 1-2 days. Hemin is known to have potential interaction with multiple other medications. Thus, interactions and side effects should be closely monitored.\nIt is advised to expedite the lab work to confirm the diagnosis of AIP before starting focused management.\nFuture: A recently published phase 1 trial used Givosiran- a RNA interferance agent which inhibits hepatic ALAS1 showed decreased frequency of attacks in patients with recurrent AIP.\nOut of the box options: In developing countries, where hematin is not available, hemodialysis has been used as an alternative option.\nSecondary Prevention: An alert bracelet is recommended for all patients for all the patients who have known diagnosis of AIP for identification in case they develop acute attacks. An attack of AIP may be precipitated by one of the \"four M's\": medication, menstruation, malnutrition, maladies.\n\n## Surgery:\nThere is no surgical option available for treatment of AIP. In rare cases with frequent attacks of AIP; liver transplantation has been done in the past.\n\n## Prevention\nPreventing exposure to the precipitating factors as mentioned in the causes section is known to prevent further attacks of AIP.", "source": "wikidoc", "question": "According to authoritative guidelines, outline the immediate diagnostic and acute management approach for an adult presenting with suspected acute intermittent porphyria (severe abdominal pain with neuropsychiatric features), specifying which urgent investigations to perform, initial supportive measures (including carbohydrate/glucose therapy), drugs that must be stopped or avoided, indications and timing for hemin/heme arginate therapy (and advice about procurement), monitoring and short-term complications to watch for, and criteria for referral or alternative treatments."}
{"guideline_text": "Stendhal syndrome\n\n# Overview\nStendhal Syndrome or Stendhal's Syndrome is a psychosomatic illness that causes rapid heartbeat, dizziness, confusion and even  hallucinations when an individual is exposed to art, usually when the art is particularly 'beautiful' or a large amount of art is in a single place. The term can also be used to describe a similar reaction to a surfeit of choice in other circumstances, e.g. when confronted with immense beauty in the natural world.\nIt is named after the famous 19th century French author Stendhal (pseudonym of Henri-Marie Beyle), who described his experience with the phenomenon during his 1817 visit to Florence, Italy in his book Naples and Florence: A Journey from Milan to Reggio.\nAlthough there are many descriptions of people becoming dizzy and fainting while taking in Florentine art, especially at the Uffizi, dating from the early 19th century on, the syndrome was only named in 1979, when it was described by Italian psychiatrist Graziella Magherini, who observed and described more than 100 similar cases among tourists and visitors in Florence.  The syndrome was first diagnosed in 1982.\nThe term is often used when describing the reactions of audiences to music of the Romantic period.\n\n# Pop culture instances\nAn extreme, fictionalized variation of Stendhal syndrome figures in the plot of the 2003 novel Diary by American author Chuck Palahniuk. The syndrome was also mentioned in the episode \"Longing\" from season one of the Showtime series The L Word, character Bette Porter, played by Jennifer Beals, experiences Stendhal Syndrome when she witnesses the photograph, \"The Last Time I and You\" by fictional photographer Carla Marie Freed.\nThe Stendhal Syndrome is a 1996 Italian thriller, written and directed by Dario Argento and starring his daughter Asia Argento. Detective Anna Manni (Asia Argento) travels to Rome on the trail of a serial rapist / killer (Thomas Kretschmann), ending up as his victim due to her sensibility to art and being struck by the Stendhal Syndrome.\nStendhal Syndrome is an album by Rusty Eye.

{"guideline_text": "Abdominal aorta\nThe abdominal aorta is the largest artery in the abdominal cavity.  As part of the aorta, it is a direct continuation of descending aorta (of the thorax).\n\n# Path\nIt begins at the level of the diaphragm, crossing it via the aortic hiatus at the vertebral level of T12.  It travels down the posterior wall of the abdomen in front of the vertebral column.  It thus follows the curvature of the lumbar vertebrae, that is, convex forward.  The peak of this convexity is at the level of the third lumbar vertebra (L3).\nIt runs parallel to the inferior vena cava, which is located just to the right of the abdominal aorta, and becomes smaller in diameter as it gives off branches.\n\n# Branches\nThe abdominal aorta supplies blood to much of the abdominal cavity. It begins at T12, and usually has the following branches:\nNote that the bifurcation (union) of the inferior vena cava is at L5 and therefore below that of the bifurcation of the aorta.\n\n# Relations\nThe abdominal aorta lies slightly to the left of the midline of the body.  It is covered, anteriorly, by the lesser omentum and stomach, behind which are the branches of the celiac artery and the celiac plexus; below these, by the lienal vein, the pancreas, the left renal vein, the inferior part of the duodenum, the mesentery, and aortic plexus.\nPosteriorly, it is separated from the lumbar vertebræ and intervertebral fibrocartilages by the anterior longitudinal ligament and left lumbar veins.\nOn the right side it is in relation above with the azygos vein, cisterna chyli, thoracic duct, and the right crus of the diaphragm—the last separating it from the upper part of the inferior vena cava, and from the right celiac ganglion; the inferior vena cava is in contact with the aorta below.\nOn the left side are the left crus of the diaphragm, the left celiac ganglion, the ascending part of the duodenum, and some coils of the small intestine.\n\n## Relationship with inferior vena cava\nThe abominal aorta's venous counterpart, the inferior vena cava (IVC), travels parallel to it on its right side.\n- Above the level of the umbilicus, the aorta is somewhat posterior to the IVC, sending the right renal artery travelling behind it.  The IVC likewise sends its opposite side counterpart, the left renal vein, crossing in front of the aorta.\n- Below the level of the umbilicus, the situation is generally reversed, with the aorta sending its right common iliac artery to cross its opposite side counterpart (the left common iliac vein) anteriorly.\n\n# Collateral circulation\nThe collateral circulation would be carried on by the anastomoses between the internal thoracic artery and the inferior epigastric artery; by the free communication between the superior and inferior mesenterics, if the ligature were placed between these vessels; or by the anastomosis between the inferior mesenteric artery and the internal pudendal artery, when (as is more common) the point of ligature is below the origin of the inferior mesenteric artery; and possibly by the anastomoses of the lumbar arteries with the branches of the internal iliac artery.\n\n# Additional images\n- The celiac artery and its branches; the stomach has been raised and the peritoneum removed.\n- Transverse section through the middle of the first lumbar vertebra, showing the relations of the pancreas.", "source": "wikidoc", "question": "According to authoritative guidelines, discuss how the anatomy of the abdominal aorta—its origin and vertebral levels, major branches, relations to surrounding structures (including the inferior vena cava), and patterns of collateral circulation—should guide surgical decision-making and predict organ perfusion when planning and performing aortic ligation at different levels of the abdomen."}

Please mail us  to indicate your interest in serving either as an Editor-In-Chief of the entire topic or as an Associate Editor-In-Chief for a subtopic. Please be sure to attach your CV and or biographical sketch.\n\n# Overview\nIn medicine, a prosthesis is an artificial extension that replaces a missing body part. It is part of the field of biomechatronics, the science of fusing mechanical devices with human muscle, skeleton, and nervous systems to assist or enhance motor control lost by trauma, disease, or defect. Prostheses are typically used to replace parts lost by injury (traumatic) or missing from birth (congenital) or to supplement defective body parts. In addition to the standard artificial limb for every-day use, many amputees have special limbs and devices to aid in the participation of sports and recreational activities.\n\n# Mechanical and Electronic Components\nIn order for a robotic prosthetic limb to work, it must have several components to integrate it into the body's function:\nBiosensors detect signals from the users nervous or muscular systems. It then relays this information to a controller located inside the device, and processes feedback from the limb and actuator (e.g., position, force) and sends it to the controller. Examples include wires that detect electrical activity on the skin, needle electrodes implanted in muscle, or solid-state electrode arrays with nerves growing through them.\nMechanical sensors process aspects affecting the device (e.g., limb position, applied force, load) and relay this information to the biosensor or controller. Examples: force meters and accelerometers.\nThe controller is connected to the user's nerve and muscular systems and the device itself. It sends intention commands from the user to the actuators of the device, and interprets feedback from the mechanical and biosensors to the user. The controller is also responsible for the monitoring and control of the movements of the device.\nAn actuator mimics the actions of a muscle in producing force and movement. Examples include a motor that aids or replaces original muscle tissue.\n\n# Cosmesis\nThough many prosthetics are clearly made of artificial materials, the practice of cosmesis, the creation of life-like limbs made from silicone or PVC, has grown in popularity. Such prosthetics, such as artificial hands, can now be made to mimic the appearance of real hands, complete with freckles, veins, hair, fingerprints and even tattoos. Custom-made cosmeses are generally more expensive (costing thousands of US dollars, depending on the level of detail), while standard cosmeses come ready-made in various sizes, though they are often not as realistic as their custom-made counterparts. Another option is the custom-made silicone cover, which can be made to match a person's skin tone but not details such as freckles or wrinkles. Cosmeses are attached to the body in any number of ways, using an adhesive, suction, form-fitting, stretchable skin, or a skin sleeve.\n\n# Prosthetic Enhancement\nWithin science fiction, and, more recently, within the scientific community, there has been consideration given to using advanced prostheses to replace healthy body parts with artificial mechanisms and systems to improve function. The morality and desirability of such technologies is being debated. Body parts such as legs, arms, hands, feet, and others can be replaced.\nThe first experiment with a healthy individual appears to have been that by the British scientist Kevin Warwick. On 2002-03-14 an implant was interfaced directly into Warwick's nervous system. The electrode array contained around 100 electrodes, was placed in the median nerve. The signals produced were detailed enough that a robot arm was able to mimic the actions of Warwick's own arm and provide a form of touch feedback again via the implant\n\n# Types\nSome types of prosthetics include:\n- Artificial limbs\n- Breast prosthesis (after mastectomy)\n- Cochlear implants\n- Corrective lenses\n- Craniofacial prosthesis\n- Dental / Maxillofacial prosthetics (in cleft palate, dentures, dental restorations)\n- Facial prosthetics\n- Hair prosthesis\n- Neuroprosthetics\n- Ocular prosthetics\n- Ostomies (colostomy, ileostomy, urostomy)\n- Penile prosthetics\n- Replacement joints (such as hips)\n- Somato prosthetics\n- Prosthetic testis\n- Transtibial prosthesis", "source": "wikidoc", "question": "According to authoritative guidelines, discuss the essential mechanical and electronic components required for a robotic prosthetic limb and how they integrate to restore motor function, and outline the clinical considerations for cosmesis, the common types of prostheses available, and the ethical issues raised by prosthetic enhancement."}
{"guideline_text": "Xenobiotic\n\n# Overview\nA xenobiotic is a chemical which is found in an organism but which is not normally produced or expected to be present in it.  It can also cover substances which are present in much higher concentrations than are usual. Specifically, drugs such as antibiotics are xenobiotics in humans because the human body does not produce them itself nor would they be expected to be present as part of a normal diet. However, the term is also used in the context of pollutants such as dioxins and polychlorinated biphenyls and their effect on the biota. Natural compounds can also become xenobiotics if they are taken up by another organism (e.g., uptake of natural human hormones by fish found downstream of sewage treatment plant outfalls).\n\n# Xenobiotic metabolism\nThe body removes xenobiotics by xenobiotic metabolism. This consists of the deactivation and the secretion of xenobiotics, and happens mostly in the liver. Secretion routes are urine, feces, breath, and sweat. Hepatic enzymes are responsible for the metabolism of xenobiotics by first activating them (oxidation, reduction, hydrolysis and/or hydration of the xenobiotic), and then conjugating the active secondary metabolite with glucuronic or sulphuric acid, or glutathione, followed by excretion in bile or urine. An example of a group of enzymes involved in xenobiotic metabolism is hepatic microsomal cytochrome P450. These enzymes that metabolize xenobiotics are very important for the pharmaceutical industry, because they are responsible for the breakdown of medications.\n\n# Xenobiotics in the environment\nXenobiotic substances are becoming an increasingly large problem in Sewage Treatment systems, since they are relatively new substances and are very difficult to categorize.  Antibiotics, for example, were derived from plants originally, and so mimic naturally occurring substances.  This, along with the natural monopoly nature of municipal Waste Water Treatment Plants makes it nearly impossible to remove this new pollutant load.\nSome xenobiotics are resistant to degradation. For example, they may be synthetic organochlorides such as plastics and pesticides, or naturally occurring organic chemicals such as polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and some fractions of crude oil and coal. However, it is believed that microorganisms are capable of degrading all the different complex and resistant xenobiotics found on the earth.\n\n# Inter-species organ transplantation\nThe term xenobiotic is also used to refer to organs transplanted from one species \nto another. For example, some researchers hope that hearts and other organs could be transplanted from pigs to humans. Many people die every year whose lives could have been saved if a critical organ had been available for transplant. Kidneys are\ncurrently the most commonly transplanted organ. Xenobiotic organs would need to be developed in such a way that they would not be rejected by the immune system. With the development of vitrification transplantable organs could be stored in organ banks\nfor long periods.", "source": "wikidoc", "question": "According to authoritative guidelines, discuss how clinicians should evaluate and manage the clinical and public‑health implications of xenobiotics—covering their definition and common sources, hepatic metabolism and routes of elimination (including the role of hepatic microsomal cytochrome P450 and conjugation pathways), implications for drug handling and persistence (including resistance to degradation and challenges in sewage treatment), and the main clinical considerations for inter‑species organ transplantation (immune rejection risk and organ storage considerations)."}

{"guideline_text": "Pyrimethamine dosage and administration\n\n# Dosage And Administration\n\n## For Treatment of Toxoplasmosis\nThe dosage of DARAPRIM for the treatment of toxoplasmosis must be carefully adjusted so as to provide maximum therapeutic effect and a minimum of side effects. At the dosage required, there is a marked variation in the tolerance to the drug. Young patients may tolerate higher doses than older individuals. Concurrent administration of folinic acid is strongly recommended in all patients.\nThe adult starting dose is 50 to 75 mg of the drug daily, together with 1 to 4 g daily of a sulfonamide of the sulfapyrimidine type, e.g. sulfadoxine. This dosage is ordinarily continued for 1 to 3 weeks, depending on the response of the patient and tolerance to therapy. The dosage may then be reduced to about one half that previously given for each drug and continued for an additional 4 to 5 weeks.\nThe pediatric dosage of DARAPRIM is 1 mg/kg/day divided into 2 equal daily doses; after 2 to 4 days this dose may be reduced to one half and continued for approximately 1 month. The usual pediatric sulfonamide dosage is used in conjunction with DARAPRIM.\n\n## For Treatment of Acute Malaria\nDARAPRIM is NOT recommended alone in the treatment of acute malaria. Fast-acting schizonticides, such as chloroquine or quinine, are indicated for treatment of acute malaria. However, DARAPRIM at a dosage of 25 mg daily for 2 days with a sulfonamide will initiate transmission control and suppression of non-falciparum malaria. DARAPRIM is only recommended for patients infected in areas where susceptible plasmodia exist. Should circumstances arise wherein DARAPRIM must be used alone in semi-immune persons, the adult dosage for acute malaria is 50 mg for 2 days; children 4 through 10 years old may be given 25 mg daily for 2 days. In any event, clinical cure should be followed by the once-weekly regimen described below for chemoprophylaxis. Regimens which include suppression should be extended through any characteristic periods of early recrudescence and late relapse, i.e., for at least 10 weeks in each case.\n\n## For Chemoprophylaxis of Malaria\nAdults and pediatric patients over 10 years – 25 mg (1 tablet) once weekly\nChildren 4 through 10 years – 12.5 mg (1/2 tablet) once weekly\nInfants and children under 4 years – 6.25 mg (1/4 tablet) once weekly.", "source": "wikidoc", "question": "According to authoritative guidelines, outline a management plan for (a) an adult and (b) a pediatric patient presenting with confirmed toxoplasmosis, detailing initial and maintenance pyrimethamine dosing, recommended concurrent therapy, duration of each treatment phase, age‑related dose adjustments and monitoring considerations (including folinic acid use), and (c) how pyrimethamine should and should not be used for acute malaria treatment and for malaria chemoprophylaxis including age‑specific dosing and circumstances when pyrimethamine alone is contraindicated."}

{"guideline_text": "Inhalable insulin\nInhalable insulin was available from September 2006 to October 2007 in the United States as a new method of delivering insulin, a drug used in the treatment of diabetes, to the body.  After the withdrawal of the only inhalable formulation, all currently available insulin formulations are administered by subcutaneous or intravenous injection.\nThe first such product to be marketed was Exubera, a powdered form of recombinant human insulin, delivered through an inhaler into the lungs where it is absorbed.\nOnce it has been absorbed, it begins working within the body over the next few hours. Diabetics still need to take a longer acting basal insulin by injection.\nA systematic review concluded that inhaled insulin \"appears to be as effective, but no better than injected short-acting insulin. The additional cost is so much more that it is unlikely to be cost-effective.\"\nIn October 2007, Pfizer announced that it would be discontinuing the production and sale of Exubera due to poor sales.\nSeveral other companies are developing inhaled forms of the drug to reduce the need for daily injections among diabetics.\n\n# History\nInsulin was introduced by Banting and Best in 1921 as an injectable agent. German researchers first introduced the idea of inhalable insulin in 1924.\nYears of failure followed until scientists realized they might be able to use new technologies to turn insulin into a concentrated powder with particles sized for inhalation.\nThis technology was developed so that the inhaled insulin can effectively reach the lung capillaries where it is absorbed.\nNektar Therapeutics of San Carlos, California developed this technology that paved the way for pharmaceutical companies to begin testing and formulating inhalable insulin.\nOnce concrete methods were developed, human tests began in the late 1990s.\nIn January 2006, the FDA approved the use of Exubera which is a form of inhalable insulin developed by Pfizer.\n\n# Approval and competing drug development\nExubera is the brand name of first formulation of inhalable insulin to receive the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval.\nIt is manufactured by Pfizer in collaboration with Nektar Therapeutics and is licensed for use by both type 1 and type 2 diabetics. However in the UK its use in under the National Health Service \"should not be recommended because it could not be proven to be more clinically or cost effective than existing treatments\",\nexcept under special circumstances.\nIn April 2006, the UK's National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence issued a preliminary statement advising against the use of inhalable insulin on the grounds that the benefits of avoiding injections did not justify the higher cost of the new product.  At that time, NICE recommended use of the new drug only in clinical trials.\nConcerns have been expressed by the Institute for Safe Medication Practices about a serious risk of dosing errors when prescribing Exubera.\nInsulin is traditionally prescribed in international units, but Exubera is prescribed in milligrams.  1 mg of Exubera is equivalent to 3 units of insulin, however, the increment is not linear: 3 mg of Exubera is equivalent to 8 units of insulin and not 9 units as might be expected, and the prescriber is strongly advised to refer to the manufacturer's conversion table before prescribing.  Furthermore, because of retention of blister contents, three consecutive doses of 1mg blisters of Exubera results in a higher dose of insulin than a single 3mg blister of Exubera, further complicating prescribing calculations.\nExubera is considered a short or rapid acting insulin. In clinical studies, Exubera reached peak concentration levels faster than some insulins administered by injection.\nThus, this form of insulin would begin working within the body faster than insulin that is injected.  Type 1 and 2 diabetics will still need an injection of longer acting insulin to maintain a basal level for a 24 hour period.\nAs of October 18, 2007, Pfizer has announced that it will no longer manufacture or market Exubera.  According to Chairman and CEO Jeffrey Kindler this is because Exubera \"failed to gain acceptance among patients and physicians.\"\nAt the time of Exubera's discontinuation, several other companies were pursuing inhaled insulin including Alkermes working with Eli Lilly and Company,\nMannKind Corporation,, \nand Aradigm working with Novo Nordisk. However, by March 2008, all of these products had been discontinued except for MannKind’s Technosphere Insulin (TI).\n\n# Lung cancer concerns\nOn April 9, 2008, Pfizer announced in its \"Dear Dr.\" letter that Exubera may have been associated with lung cancer: of the 4,740 patients who used Exubera in clinical trials, six have developed lung cancer as of April 2008, compared to only one of the 4,292 patients in the placebo group. The association was not statistically significant, and Pfizer maintained in its letter that \"Exubera remains a safe and effective medication.\"\nIn a letter 18 June 2008, Pfizer informed UK doctors of the above mentioned six cases, noting that they all had a prior history of cigarette smoking and that they were planning to investigate further the \"observed imbalance in diagnosed lung cases\" with an international observational trial. Pfizer's letter also stated that Nektar had stopped searching for a new marketing partner and therefore Pfizer would withdraw its Marketing Authorisation around September 2008.\n\n# Pfizer patent infringement lawsuit\nNovo Nordisk, a Danish diabetes pharmaceutical company, filed suit against Pfizer on August 1, 2006, claiming patent infringement.\nThe lawsuit seeks both compensatory damages and injunctive relief.  Novo sought a preliminary injunction preventing the release of Pfizer's planned September 2006 launch of the diabetes drug.  A federal judge, however, delayed any decision on Novo Nordisk's request for injunctive relief until at least December 4, 2006 when a court hearing is scheduled in the case.\nPfizer's answer contends that Novo wants to deny diabetics access to Exubera, the only FDA approved inhaled insulin, and interfere with the company's pharmaceutical business.\nOn December 14, 2006 a federal judge denied Novo Nordisk's request for a preliminary injunction to halt sales of Pfizer's inhaled insulin. \nThe patent lawsuit, however, has not been dismissed, and Pfizer's legal defenses are preserved. The pharmaceutical companies are still litigating in court over their respective inhaled insulin patent claims, a process that could take some time to resolve.", "source": "wikidoc", "question": "According to authoritative guidelines, discuss the recommended role (or lack thereof) of inhalable insulin (for example Exubera) in the management of adults with type 1 or type 2 diabetes, addressing its comparative efficacy versus injected short‑acting insulin, need for concomitant basal insulin, dosing and prescribing complexities, safety concerns (including reported lung cancer signal), cost‑effectiveness, and the resulting regulatory/recommendation stance for routine clinical use."}
{"guideline_text": "Chloramphenicol adverse reactions\n\n# Blood Dyscrasias\nThe most serious adverse effect of chloramphenicol is bone marrow depression.  Serious and fatal blood dyscrasias (aplastic anemia, hypoplastic anemia, thrombocytopenia and granulocytopenia) are known to occur after the administration of chloramphenicol.  An irreversible type of marrow depression leading to aplastic anemia with a high rate of mortality is characterized by the appearance weeks or months after therapy of bone marrow aplastia or hypoplasia.  Peripherally, pancytopenia is most often observed, but in a small number of cases only one or two of the three major cell types (erythrocytes, leukocytes, platelets) may be depressed.\nA reversible type of bone marrow depression, which is dose related, may occur.  This type of marrow depression is characterized by vacuolization of the erythroid cells, reduction of reticulocytes and leukopenia, and responds promptly to the withdrawal of chloramphenicol.\nAn exact determination of the risk of serious and fatal blood dyscrasias is not possible because of lack of accurate information regarding 1) the size of the population at risk, 2) the total number of drug-associated dyscrasias, 3) the total number of non-drug associated dyscrasias.\nIn a report to the California State Assembly by the California Medical Association and the State Department of Public Health in January 1967, the risk of fatal aplastic anemia was estimated at 1:24,200 to 1:40,500 based on two dosage levels.\nThere have been reports of aplastic anemia attributed to chloramphenicol which later terminated in leukemia.\nParoxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria has also been reported.\n\n# Gastrointestinal Reactions\nNausea, vomiting, glossitis and stomatitis, diarrhea and enterocolitis may occur in low incidence.\n\n# Neurotoxic Reactions\nHeadache, mild depression, mental confusion and delirium have been described in patients receiving chloramphenicol; optic and peripheral neuritis have been reported, usually following long-term therapy.  If this occurs, the drug should be promptly withdrawn.\n\n# Hypersensitivity Reactions\nFever, macular and vesicular rashes, angioedema, urticaria and anaphylaxis may occur.  Herxheimer reactions have occurred during therapy for typhoid fever.\n\n# \"Gray Syndrome\"\nToxic reactions including fatalities have occurred in the premature and newborn; the signs and symptoms associated with these reactions have been referred to as the gray syndrome.  One case of gray syndrome has been reported in an infant born to a mother having received chloramphenicol during labor.  One case has been reported in a 3-month old infant.  The following summarizes the clinical and laboratory studies that have been made on these patients:\na) In most cases therapy with chloramphenicol had been instituted within the first 48 hours of life.\nb) Symptoms first appeared after 3 to 4 days of continued treatment with high doses of chloramphenicol.\nc) The symptoms appeared in the following order:\n1) abdominal distension with or without emesis;\n2) progressive pallid cyanosis;\n3) vasomotor collapse, frequently accompanied by irregular respiration;\n4) death within a few hours of onset of these symptoms.\nd) The progression of symptoms from onset to exitus was accelerated with higher dose schedules.\ne) Preliminary blood serum level studies revealed unusually high concentrations of chloramphenicol (over 90 mcg/mL after repeated doses).\nf) Termination of therapy upon early evidence of the associated symptomatology frequently reversed the process with complete recovery.", "source": "wikidoc", "question": "According to authoritative guidelines, discuss how clinicians should recognize, monitor for, prevent, and manage the major adverse reactions of chloramphenicol—including blood dyscrasias (distinguishing reversible dose-related marrow suppression from delayed irreversible aplastic anemia), neurotoxic and hypersensitivity reactions, gastrointestinal effects, and the “gray syndrome” in neonates—with attention to timing of onset, recommended investigational and withdrawal actions, and counselling/recording measures to minimise patient harm."}

{"guideline_text": "Ab externo canaloplasty for primary open-angle glaucoma\n\nEvidence-based recommendations on ab externo canaloplasty for primary open-angle glaucoma in adults. This involves widening the eye’s main draining canal by inserting a tiny tube, then removing the tube and stitching the canal to keep it open.\n\n# Recommendations\nCurrent evidence on the safety and efficacy of ab externo canaloplasty for primary open-angle glaucoma is adequate to support the use of this procedure provided that standard arrangements are in place for clinical governance, consent and audit.\nAb externo canaloplasty for primary open-angle glaucoma should only be done by clinicians with specific training in the procedure.# Indications and current treatments\nPrimary open-angle glaucoma is a chronic condition associated with elevated intraocular pressure. It leads to progressive damage to the optic nerve. Early stages are usually asymptomatic but as the condition progresses it causes visual impairment and, if untreated, blindness.\nTreatment is usually eye drops containing drugs that either reduce the production of aqueous humor or increase its drainage. Surgical procedures such as trabeculectomy, drainage tubes, deep sclerectomy, viscocanalostomy or laser trabeculoplasty may also be used.# The procedure\nAb externo canaloplasty is a surgical technique that aims to reduce intraocular pressure by improving drainage of aqueous fluid from the eye. It is done under local or general anaesthetic. A superficial hinged flap of sclera is made and a deeper flap excised, exposing the Schlemm's canal. An ultrasound imaging system is used to identify the canal and to visualise the surgical instruments when they are in the canal. A microcatheter with an illuminated tip is introduced into the canal and advanced around its entire circumference. As the catheter tip advances, viscoelastic fluid is injected into the canal to dilate it. When catheterisation of the entire canal is complete a suture is tied to the tip of the microcatheter and it is withdrawn, pulling the suture into the canal. The suture is cut, tied in a loop encircling the inner wall of the canal and tightened. This widens the canal. The superficial flap is sutured.# Efficacy\nThis section describes efficacy outcomes from the published literature that the committee considered as part of the evidence about this procedure. For more detailed information on the evidence, see the interventional procedure overview.\nIn a systematic review and meta-analysis of 1,498 eyes, comparing canaloplasty with trabeculectomy, there was no statistically significant difference between groups for complete success rates (maximum postoperative intraocular pressure  of 18 mmHg without medication) and qualified success rates (maximum IOP of 18 mmHg with or without medication) after the procedure. In a case series of 224 patients who had canaloplasty, the complete success rates at 1-, 2- and 3‑year follow‑up were 44% (64/144), 38% (30/80) and 31% (9/29) respectively, and the qualified success rates were 75% (108/44), 74% (59/80) and 59% (17/29) respectively.\nIn the systematic review and meta-analysis of 1,498 eyes, the mean IOP reduction was 9.94 mmHg (95% confidence interval  8.42 to 11.45) and was statistically significantly lower in the canaloplasty group (mean difference between groups −3.61, 95% CI −5.53 to −1.69 mmHg) at 1‑year follow‑up. In a review of 914 eyes treated by canaloplasty alone (n=777 eyes) or with phacoemulsification (n=137 eyes), the mean IOP reduction (after a maximum of 36 months' follow‑up) ranged from 29% to 66% with canaloplasty alone and from 42% to 46% with canaloplasty plus phacoemulsification. In the case series of 224 patients, there was a statistically significant decrease in mean IOP (±standard deviation ) from 29.4±7.9 mmHg before surgery to 16.8±4.2 mmHg at 1 year, 17.1±4.7 mmHg at 2 years and 16.9±3.1 mmHg at 42 months (p<0.0001).\nIn the systematic review and meta-analysis of 1,498 eyes, the mean reduction in antiglaucoma medication use was 2.11 (95% CI 1.80 to 2.42) 1 year after canaloplasty, and there was no statistically significant difference in medication reduction between groups (mean difference −0.37, 95% CI −0.83 to 0.08). In the review of 914 eyes, mean medication use reduction (after a maximum of 36 months' follow‑up) ranged from 25% to 100% with canaloplasty alone and from 66% to 86% with canaloplasty plus phacoemulsification. In a randomised controlled trial of 59 patients comparing phaco-canaloplasty (n=29) with phaco-non-penetrating deep sclerectomy (n=30), there was a statistically significant decrease in the mean (±SD) number of medications used in both groups, from 2.64±0.68 before surgery to 0.27±0.67 at 1 year in the phaco-canaloplasty group and from 2.89±0.94 to 0.55±0.94 in the phaco-non-penetrating deep sclerectomy group (p<0.05 for the difference within groups, no statistically significant difference between groups).\nIn a retrospective comparative study of 327 patients who had canaloplasty (n=175) or trabeculectomy (n=152), which collected self-reported questionnaire data 2 years after surgery, the mean score (±SD) for satisfaction with results of surgery (ranging from 0, totally discontented, to 10, totally contented) was statistically significantly higher in the canaloplasty group (8.09±2.71) compared with the trabeculectomy group (7.46±2.61, p=0.034). In the same study, there were statistically significantly fewer revision surgeries reported in the canaloplasty group (mean number of revision surgeries per patient 0.12±0.43) compared with the trabeculectomy group (0.67±1.14, p<0.001). Also, patients were statistically significantly more likely to have a positive mood after canaloplasty (2.30±0.83) compared with trabeculectomy (1.96±0.87, p=0.009), stress caused by surgery or follow‑ups and treatments was statistically significantly lower with canaloplasty (4.18±0.86 and 4.36±0.80 respectively) compared with trabeculectomy (3.59±1.12 and 3.40±1.20 respectively; p<0.001), and nonvisual and visual ocular symptoms were statistically significantly lower in the canaloplasty group (p<0.05).\nThe specialist advisers listed the following key efficacy outcomes: intraocular pressure reduction and reduced use of glaucoma medication.# Safety\nThis section describes safety outcomes from the published literature that the committee considered as part of the evidence about this procedure. For more detailed information on the evidence, see the interventional procedure overview.\nIntraocular pressure (IOP) of more than 30 mmHg after the procedure was reported in 2% to 9% of eyes in a review of 914 eyes treated by canaloplasty alone (n=777 eyes) or by canaloplasty with phacoemulsification (n=137 eyes) at a maximum of 36 months' follow‑up.\nHyphaema (greater than 1 mm layered blood) was statistically significantly more frequent in the canaloplasty group than in the trabeculectomy group at 1‑year follow‑up, in a systematic review and meta-analysis of 1,498 eyes (odds ratio  9.24, 95% confidence interval  3.09 to 27.60). The incidence of hyphaema in the canaloplasty group was 25% (304/1221). Hyphaema was reported in 23% (7/30) of patients treated by canaloplasty and in 1 patient treated by trabeculectomy within 90 days of the procedure in a randomised controlled trial (RCT) of 62 patients.\nDescemet's membrane detachment was only seen in the canaloplasty group, with an incidence of 3% (37/1185) at 1‑year follow‑up in the systematic review and meta-analysis of 1,498 eyes. Descemet's membrane detachment was reported in 2% to 6% of eyes in the review of 914 eyes at a maximum of 36 months' follow‑up. Microperforation of Descemet's membrane during the procedure was reported in 7% (2/30) of patients treated by canaloplasty in the RCT of 62 patients comparing canaloplasty (n=30) with trabeculectomy (n=32). Trabeculo Descemet's membrane rupture was reported in 1 patient in each group during the procedure in an RCT of 59 patients treated by phaco-canaloplasty (n=29) or phaco-non-penetrating deep sclerectomy (n=30).\nHypotony was statistically significantly less frequent after canaloplasty than after trabeculectomy at 1‑year follow‑up, in the systematic review and meta-analysis of 1,498 eyes (OR 0.32, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.80). The incidence of hypotony in the canaloplasty group was 9% (94/1091). Flat anterior chamber was reported in 0% to 2% of eyes in the review of 914 eyes, and persistent hypotony was reported in 0% to 1% of eyes.\nCentral retinal artery occlusion was reported in 1 out of 36 patients in the phaco-canaloplasty group and in none of the patients in the trabeculectomy group in a retrospective comparative study of 77 patients.\nOcular decompression retinopathy was reported in a single case report 1 day after canaloplasty. It was treated with tobramycin and dexamethasone. Three months after canaloplasty, IOP remained in control at 16 mmHg and all retinal haemorrhages had completely resolved.\nChoroidal effusion or detachment was statistically significantly less frequent in the canaloplasty group than in the trabeculectomy group, in the systematic review and meta-analysis of 1,498 eyes within 1 year of the procedure (OR 0.25, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.97). Choroidal detachment was reported in 7% (2/29) of patients who had phaco-canaloplasty and in none of the patients who had phaco-non-penetrating deep sclerectomy, in the RCT of 59 patients.\nCataract formation was reported in 0% to 8% of eyes in the review of 914 eyes at a maximum of 36 months' follow‑up.\nAnterior synechiae during the procedure was reported in 1 patient treated by canaloplasty in the RCT of 62 patients.

{"guideline_text": "Heavy chain disease\n\n# Overview\nHeavy chain disease is a form of paraproteinemia with a proliferation of heavy chains.\nThis disease is characterized by an excessive production of immunoglobulin heavy chains that are short and truncated. The amino acid sequence on the amino terminal is completely normal, but there is a deletion in the protein structure that extends from the middle of the variable region, through the first domain of the constant region, and ending just before the position of the first disulfide bond between the two heavy chains. This deletion causes the heavy chains to lose the ability to form disulfide bonds with the light chains. The defect in the immunoglobulins arises during the faulty coupling of the variable and constant regions during somatic recombination.\n\n# Classification\nThere are three forms:\n- alpha chain disease\n- gamma chain disease\n- mu chain disease\n\n### IgA/αHCD\nThe most common type of heavy chain disease is the IgA type, known as αHCD. This is because the most common immunoglobulin in the body is IgA. The most common type of αHCD is the digestive form, however it has also been reported in the respiratory tract, and other areas of the body.\n\n### IgG/γHCD\nIgM and IgG heavy chain diseases, which are known as μHCD and γHCD respectively, are fairly common and are present in various tissues.\nThe γHCD can be divided into three categories based on the various clinical and pathological features. These categories are disseminated lymphoproliferative disease, localized proliferative disease and no apparent proliferative disease.\n- Disseminated lymphoproliferative disease is found in 57-66% of patients diagnosed with γHCD. Lymphadenopathy and constitutional symptoms are the usual features.\n- Localized proliferative disease is found in approximately 25% of γHCD patients. This is characterized by a localization of the mutated heavy chains in extramedullary tissue, or solely in the bone marrow.\n- No apparent proliferative disease is seen in 9-17% of patients with γHCD, and there is almost always an underlying autoimmune disorder in these patients.\n\n### IgM/μHCD\nThe IgM type of heavy chain disease, μHCD, is often misdiagnosed as chronic lymphoid leukemia (CLL) because the two diseases are often associated with each other and show similar symptoms.", "source": "wikidoc", "question": "According to authoritative guidelines on heavy chain disease, outline the classification of heavy chain diseases (α, γ, μ), and for each type describe the typical clinical presentation, common sites of involvement, key pathological categories (including the γHCD subtypes), and the principal diagnostic features that help distinguish each from relevant mimics such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia."}
{"guideline_text": "Glutamate receptor\nGlutamate receptors are synaptic receptors located primarily on the membranes of neuronal cells.  Glutamate is one of the 20 amino acids used to assemble proteins and as a result is abundant in many areas of the body, but it also functions as a neurotransmitter and is particularly abundant in the nervous system.  Glutamate receptors are responsible for the glutamate-mediated post-synaptic excitation of neural cells, and are important for neural communication, memory formation, learning, and regulation. Furthermore, glutamate receptors are implicated in the pathologies of a number of neurodegenerative diseases due to their central role in excitotoxicity and their prevalence throughout the central nervous system.\n\n# Function\nGlutamate is the most prominent neurotransmitter in the body, being present in over 50% of nervous tissue. Glutamate was initially discovered to be a neurotransmitter in insect studies in the early 1960s. The two primary glutamate receptors are named after agonists that bind to them with high specificity: AMPA (α-amino-3-hydroxyl-5-methyl-4-isoxazole-propionate) and NMDA (N-Methyl-D-Aspartate). One of the major functions of glutamate receptors appears to be the modulation of synaptic plasticity, a property of the brain thought to be vital for memory and learning. Both metabotropic and ionotropic glutamate receptors have been shown to have an effect on synaptic plasticity. An increase or decrease in the number of ionotropic glutamate receptors on a post-synaptic cell may lead to long-term potentiation or long-term depression of that cell, respectively. Additionally, metabotropic glutamate receptors may modulate synaptic plasticity by regulating post-synaptic protein synthesis through second messenger systems. Research shows that glutamate receptors are present in CNS glial cells as well as neurons. It is suggested that these glutamate receptors play a role in modulating gene expression in glial cells, both during the proliferation and differentiation of glial precursor cells in brain development and in mature glial cells.\n\n# Types\nGlutamate receptors can be divided into two groups according to the mechanism by which their activation gives rise to a postsynaptic current. Ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs) form the ion channel pore that activates when glutamate binds to the receptor. Metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) indirectly activate ion-channels on the plasma membrane through a signaling cascade that involves G proteins. \nIonotropic receptors tend to be quicker in relaying information but metabotropic are associated with a more prolonged stimulus.  This is due to the usage of many different messengers to carry out the signal but since there is a cascade, just one activation of a G-protein can lead to multiple activations. Glutamate receptors are usually not specifically geared towards glutamate exclusively as the ligand and sometimes even requires another agonist.\nThere are many specific subtypes of glutamate receptors, and it is customary to refer to primary subtypes by a chemical which binds to it more selectively than glutamate. The research, though, is ongoing as subtypes are identified and chemical affinities measured. There are several compounds which are routinely used in glutamate receptor research and associated with receptor subtypes:\nDue to the diversity of glutamate receptors, their subunits are encoded by numerous gene families. Sequence similarities between mammals show a common evolutionary origin for many mGluR and all iGluR genes. There is complete conservation of reading frames and splice sites of GluR genes between chimpanzees and humans, suggesting no gross structural changes after humans diverged from the human-chimpanzee common ancestor. However, there is a possibility that two human-specific \"fixed\" amino acid substitutions, D71G in GRIN3A and R727H in GRIN3B, are specifically associated with human brain function.\n\n## Ionotropic\nIonotropic glutamate receptor subunits and their genes:\n\n## Metabotropic\nMetabotropic glutamate receptors are all named mGluR# and are further broken down into three groups:\n\n# Structure and mechanism\nGlutamate receptors exist primarily in the central nervous system. These receptors can be found on the dendrites of post-synaptic cells and bind to glutamate released into the synaptic cleft by pre-synaptic cells. They are also present on both astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. The glutamate binds to the extracellular portion of the receptor and provokes a response, however the various types of receptors can produce different responses. Ionotropic and metabatropic glutamate receptors, with the exception of NMDA, are found on cultured glial cells which can open in response to glutamate and cause cells to activate second messengers to regulate gene expression and release neuroactive compounds. Furthermore, brain slices show glutamate receptors are ubiquitously expressed in both developing and astrocytes and oligodendrocytes in vivo. Because of this, glial glutamate receptors are thought to be vital for glial cell development.\n\n## Ionotropic\nAll ionotropic glutamate receptors are ligand-gated nonselective cation channels which allow the flow of K+, Na+ and sometimes Ca2+ in response to glutamate binding. Upon binding, the agonist will stimulate direct action of the central pore of the receptor, an ion channel, allowing ion flow and causing EPSC (exitatory post-synaptic current). This current is depolarizing and, if enough glutamate receptors are activated, may trigger an action potential in the post-synaptic neuron. All produce excitatory post-synaptic current, but the speed and duration of the current is different for each type. NMDA receptors have an internal binding site for an Mg2+ ion creating a voltage dependant block which is removed by outward flow of positive current. Since the block must be removed by outward current flow, NMDA receptors rely on the EPSC produced by AMPA receptors to open. NMDA receptors are permeable to Ca2+  which is an important cation in the nervous system  and has been linked to gene regulation. It is thought that the flow of Ca2+ through NMDA receptors can cause both LTP and LTD by transducing signaling cascades and regulating gene expression.\n\n## Metabotropic\nMetabotropic glutamate receptors, which belong to subfamily C of G protein-coupled receptors are divided into three groups, with a total of eight sub-types. The mGluRs are composed of three distinct regions: the extracellular region, the transmembrane region, and the intracellular region. The extracellular region is composed of a Venus Flytrap (or VFT) module that binds glutamate, and a cysteine-rich domain that is thought to play a role in transmitting the conformational change induced by ligand binding from in the VFT module to the transmembrane region. The transmembrane region consists of seven transmembrane domains and connects the extracellular region to the intracellular region where G protein coupling occurs. Glutamate binding to the extracellular region of an mGluR causes G proteins bound to the intracellular region to be phosphorylated, affecting multiple biochemical pathways and ion channels in the cell. Because of this, mGluRs can both increase or decrease the exitability of the post synaptic cell, thereby causing a wide range of physiological effects.\n\n# Effects outside the central nervous system\nGlutamate receptors are thought to be responsible for the reception and transduction of umami taste stimuli. Taste receptors of the T1R family, belonging to the same class of GPCR as metabotropic Glutamate Receptors are involved. Additionally, the mGluRs as well as ionotropic glutamate receptors in neural cells have been found in taste buds and may contribute to the umami taste. Numerous ionotropic glutamate receptor subunits are expressed by heart tissue, but their specific function is still unknown. Western blots and northern blots confirmed the presence of iGluRs in cardiac tissue. Immunohistochemistry localized the iGluRs to cardiac nerve terminals, ganglia, conducting fibers, and some myocardiocytes. Glutamate receptors are (as mentioned above) also expressed in pancreatic islet cells. AMPA iGluRs modulate the secretion of insulin and glucagon in the pancreas, opening the possibility of treatment of diabetes via glutamate receptor antagonists. Small unmyelinated sensory nerve terminals in the skin also express NMDA and non-NMDA receptors. Subcutaneous injections of receptor blockers in rats successfully analgesized skin from formalin-induced inflammation, raising possibilities of targeting peripheral glutamate receptors in the skin for pain treatment.\n\n# Clinical significance\nSo far, no genetic diseases in humans have been linked to mutations of any of the glutamate receptor subunit genes. However, a specific genotype of human GluR6 was discovered to have a slight influence on the age of onset of Huntington's disease. Antibodies to glutamate receptor subunit genes accompany various neurological disorders (e.g. GluR3 in Rasmussen's encephalitis and GluR2 in nonfamilial olivopontocerebellar degeneration, but the exact role of antibodies in disease manifestation is still not entirely known.\n\n## Excitotoxicity\nOverstimulation of glutamate receptors causes neurodegeneration and neuronal damage through a process called excitotoxicity. Excessive glutamate, or excitotoxins acting on the same glutamate receptors, overactivate glutamate receptors (specifically NMDARs), causing high levels of calcium ions (Ca2+) to influx into the postsynaptic cell.\nHigh Ca2+ concentrations activate a cascade of cell degradation processes involving proteases, lipases, nitric oxide synthase, and a number of enzymes that damage cell structures often to the point of cell death. Ingestion or exposure to excitotoxins that act on glutamate receptors can induce excitotoxicity and cause toxic effects on the central nervous system.  This becomes a problem for cells as it feeds into a cycle of positive feedback cell death.\nGlutamate excitotoxicity triggered by oversitmulation of glutamate receptors also contributes to intracellular oxidative stress. Proximal glial cells use a cystine/glutamate antiporter (xCT) to transport cystine into the cell and glutamate out. Excessive extracellular glutamate concentrations reverse xCT and glial cells no longer have enough cystine to synthesize glutathione (GSH), an antioxidant. Lack of GSH leads to more reactive oxygen species (ROS) that damages and kills the glial cell, which then cannot reuptake and process extracellular glutamate. This is another positive feedback in glutamate excitotoxicity. In addition, increased Ca2+ concentrations activates nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and the over-synthesis of nitric oxide (NO). High NO concentration damages mitochondria, leading to more energy depletion, and adds oxidative stress to the neuron as NO is a ROS.\n\n## Neurodegeneration\nIn the case of traumatic brain injury or cerebral ischemia (e.g. cerebral infarction or hemorrhage), acute neurodegeneration caused by excitotoxicity may spread to proximal neurons through two processes. Hypoxia and hypoglycemia trigger bioenergetic failure; mitochondria stop producing ATP energy. Na+/K+-ATPase can no longer maintain sodium/potassium ion concentration gradients across the plasma membrane. Glutamate transporters (EAATs), which use the Na+/K+ gradient, reverse glutamate transport (efflux) in affected neurons and astrocytes, and depolarization increases downstream synaptic release of glutamate. In addition, cell death via lysis or apoptosis releases cytoplasmic glutamate outside of the ruptured cell. These two forms of glutamate release cause a continual domino effect of excitotoxic cell death and further increased extracellular glutamate concentrations.\n\n## Neurodegenerative diseases\nGlutamate receptors’ significance in exitotoxicity links it to many neurogenerative diseases. Conditions such as exposure to excitotoxins, old age, congenital predisposition, and brain trauma can trigger glutamate receptor activation and ensuing excitotoxic neurodegeneration. This damage to the central nervous system propagates symptoms associated with a number of diseases.\nNeurogenerative diseases thought to be mediated (at least in part) through stimulation of glutamate receptors:\n- AIDS dementia complex\n- Alzheimer’s disease\n- amyotrophic lateral sclerosis\n- combined systems disease (vitamin B12 deficiency)\n- depression/anxiety\n- drug addiction, tolerance, and dependency\n- glaucoma\n- hepatic encephalopathy\n- Huntington’s disease\n- hydroxybutyric aminoaciduria\n- hyperhomocysteinemia and homocysteinuria\n- hyperprolinemia\n- lead encephalopathy\n- Leber’s disease\n- MELAS syndrome\n- MERRF\n- mitochondrial abnormalities (and other inherited or acquired biochemical disorders)\n- multiple sclerosis\n- neuropathic pain syndromes (e.g. causalgia or painful peripheral neuropathies)\n- nonketotic hyperglycinemia\n- olivopontocerebellar atrophy (some recessive forms)\n- Parkinsonism\n- Essential tremor\n- Rett syndrome\n- schizophrenia\n- sulfite oxidase deficiency\n- Wernicke’s encephalopath\n\n# Potential therapeutic applications\nGlutamate receptors have been found to have an influence in ischemia/stroke, seizures, Parkinson's Disease, Huntington's Disease, and aching. Almost every disease involving glutamate receptors have very similar if not identical pathways, differing slightly only in the area in the brain where the issue occurs. The following explores some of the treatments currently being proposed by targeting the glutamate receptor pathway.\n\n## Ischemia\nIt has been observed that during ischemia, the brain has an unnaturally high concentration of extracellular glutamate.  This is linked to an inadequate supply of ATP which drives the glutamate transport levels that keep the concentrations of glutamate in balance. This usually leads to an excessive activation of glutamate receptors, which may lead to neuronal injury. After this overexposure, the post synaptic terminals tend to keep glutamate around for long periods of time which results in a difficulty in depolarization. Antagonists for NMDA and AMPA receptors seem to have a large benefit, with more aid the sooner it is administered after onset of the neural ischemia.\n\n## Seizures\nGlutamate receptors have been discovered to have a role in the onset of epilepsy. NMDA and metabotropic types have been found to induce epileptic convulsions. Using rodent models, labs have found that the introduction of antagonists to these glutamate receptors help counteract the epileptic symptoms. Since glutamate is a ligand for ligand-gated ion channels, the binding of this neurotransmitter will open gates and increase sodium and calcium conductance.  These ions play an integral part in the causes of seizures. Group 1 metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGlu1 and mGlu5) are the primary cause of seizing so applying an antagonist to these receptors helps in preventing convulsions.\n\n## Parkinson's disease\nLate onset neurological disorders like Parkinson's disease may be partially due to endogenous glutamate binding NMDA and AMPA glutamate receptors.  Invitro spinal cord cultures with glutamate transport inhibitors led to degeneration of motor neurons which was counteracted by some AMPA receptor antagonists like GYKI 52466. Research also suggests that the metabotropic glutamate receptor, mGlu4, is directly involved in movement disorders associated with the basal ganglia through selectively modulating glutamate in the striatum.\n\n## Huntington's disease\nIn addition to similar mechanisms causing Parkinson's disease in respect to NMDA or AMPA receptors, Huntington's disease was also proposed to exhibit metabolic and mitochondrial deficiency, which exposes striatal neurons to the over activation of NMDA receptors. There has been a proposition of using folic acid as a possible treatment for Huntington's due to the inhibition it exhibits on homocysteine, which increases vulnerability of nerve cells to glutamate. This could decrease the effect that the glutamate has on glutamate receptors and reduce cell response to a safer level, not reaching excitotoxicity.\n\n## Aching\nHyperalgesia is directly involved with spinal NMDA receptors. Administered NMDA antagonists in a clinical setting produce significant side effects, although more research is being done in intrathecal administration.  Since the spinal NMDA receptors are what links the area of pain to the brain's pain processing center, the thalamus, these glutamate receptors are a prime target for treatment.  One proposed way to cope with the pain is actually subconsciously through the visualization technique.\n\n## Diabetes\nDiabetes is a peculiar case because it is influenced by glutamate receptors present outside of the central nervous system, and it also influences glutamate receptors in the central nervous system.\nDiabetes mellitus, an endocrine disorder, induces cognitive impairment and defects of long-term potential in the hippocampus, interfering with synaptic plasticity. Defects of long-term potential in the hippocampus are due to abnormal glutamate receptors, specifically the malfunctioning NMDA glutamate receptors during early stages of the disease.\nResearch is being done to address the possibility of using hyperglycaemia and insulin to regulate these receptors and restore cognitive functions.\nPancreatic islets regulating insulin and glucagon levels also express glutamate receptors. It is possible to treat diabetes via glutamate receptor antagonists, but not much research has been done. The difficulty of modifying peripheral GluR without having detrimental effects on the central nervous system, which is saturated with GluR, may be the cause of this.\n\n## Multiple Sclerosis\nInducing experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in animal models as a model for MS has targeted some glutamate receptors as a pathway for potential therapeutic applications. This research has found that a group of drugs interact with the NMDA, AMPA, and kainate glutamate receptor to control neurovascular permeability, inflammatory mediator synthesis, and resident glial cell functions including CNS myelination. Oligodendrocytes are the cells in the CNS that myelinate axons.  The myelintaiton disfunction in MS is partly due to the excitotoxicity of those cells.  By regulating the drugs which interact with those glutamate receptors, it may be possible to regulate glutamate binding, and thereby reducing levels of Ca2+ influx.  The experiments showed improved oligodendrocyte survival and remyelination increased. Furthermore, CNS inflammation, apoptosis, and axonal damage were reduced.\n\n## Schizophrenia\nIt has been found that in schizophrenia, the expression of the mRNA for the NR2A subunit of the NMDA glutamate receptor is decreased in a subset of inhibitory interneurons in the cerebral cortex. This is suggested by upregulation of GABA, an inhibitory neurotransmitter.  In schizophrenia, the expression of the NR2A subunit of NDMA receptors in mRNA was experimentally undetectable in 49-73% in GABA neurons that usually express it.  These are mainly in GABA cells expressing the calcium buffering protein parvalbumin (PV) which exhibits fast-spiking firing properties and target the perisomatic (basket cells) and axo-axonic (chandelier cells) compartments of pyramidal neurons. The study found that the density of NR2A mRNA-expressing PV neurons was decreased by as much as 50% in subjects with schizophrenia. In addition, density of immunohistochemically labeled glutamatergic terminals with an antibody against the vesicular glutamate transporter vGluT1 also exhibited a reduction that paralleled the reduction in the NR2A-expressing PV neurons. Together these observations suggest that glutamatergic innervation of PV-containing inhibitory neurons appears to be deficient in schizophrenia. Expression of NR2A mRNA has also been found to be altered in the inhibitory neurons that contain another calcium buffer, calbindin, targeting the dendrites of pyramidal neurons and the expression of the mRNA for the GluR5 kainate receptor in GABA neurons has also been found to be changed in organisms with schizophrenia. Current research is looking into glutamate receptor antagonists as potential treatments for schizophrenia. Memantine, a weak nonselective NMDA receptor antagonist, was used as an add-on to clozapine therapy in a clinical trial. Refractory schizophrenia patients showed associated improvements in both negative and positive symptoms, underscoring the potential uses of GluR antagonists as antipsychotics. Furthermore, administration of noncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonists have been tested on rat models. Scientists proposed that specific antagonists can act on GABAergic interneurons, enhancing cortical inhibition and preventing excessive glutamatergic transmission associated with schizophrenia. These and other atypical antipsychotic drugs can be used together to inhibit excessive excitability in pyramidal cells, decreasing the symptoms of schizophrenia.", "source": "wikidoc", "question": "\"According to an authoritative guideline summary on glutamate receptors, discuss how overstimulation of glutamate receptors causes excitotoxic neuronal injury and explain how this pathophysiology supports the therapeutic use of NMDA and AMPA receptor antagonists in acute cerebral ischemia, addressing the mechanism, rationale for early administration, expected neuroprotective effects, and key limitations or challenges noted in the guideline.\""}

{"guideline_text": "British Society of Gastroenterology guidance for management of inflammatory bowel disease during the COVID-19 pandemic\n\n\n\n# Abstract\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is putting unprecedented pressures on healthcare systems globally. Early insights have been made possible by rapid sharing of data from China and Italy. In the UK, we have rapidly mobilised inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) centres in order that preparations can be made to protect our patients and the clinical services they rely on. This is a novel coronavirus; much is unknown as to how it will affect people with IBD. We also lack information about the impact of different immunosuppressive medications. To address this uncertainty, the British Society of Gastroenterology (BSG) COVID-19 IBD Working Group has used the best available data and expert opinion to generate a risk grid that groups patients into highest, moderate and lowest risk categories. This grid allows patients to be instructed to follow the UK government's advice for shielding, stringent and standard advice regarding social distancing, respectively. Further considerations are given to service provision, medical and surgical therapy, endoscopy, imaging and clinical trials.\n\n# Introduction\nInflammatory bowel disease (IBD), comprising Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), is a condition in which the gastrointestinal immune system responds inappropriately. IBD is therefore often treated with immunosuppressing medications to control inflammation and prevent 'flares', a worsening of symptoms, which may be unpredictable.\nWhile it is known that 0.8% of people in the UK currently have IBD (approximately 524 000 patients), only 44% have been to a clinic in the past 3 years 1 2 . There will be many patients who are worried about the effect of the coronavirus pandemic (SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19 disease) on their IBD and vice versa, many of whom will be unknown to secondary care.\nDuring the COVID-19 outbreak, we will do everything we can to keep our IBD patients safe. The greatest risks relate not only to the infection itself, but also the emergency reorganisation of hospital and general practice services to deal with the pandemic. This will result in significant changes to routine IBD services. A combined approach covering both primary and secondary care is therefore required to keep vulnerable patients with IBD out of hospital as much as possible.\nInsights from Hubei, China and from Italy suggest hospital attendance for non-COVID-19 illness may provide a reservoir for further spread of infection. However, alterations to the way we deliver IBD care in the UK must be balanced against the risks of under treated, active IBD. Importantly, patients with active IBD are likely to have a higher risk of infection both in the community and during inpatient care, even in the absence of immunosuppressive treatment. [bib_ref] Serious infection and mortality in patients with Crohn's disease: more than 5..., Lichtenstein [/bib_ref] Therefore, it is of paramount importance to control intestinal inflammation in IBD to prevent adverse outcomes.\n\n## Covid-19 disease and ibd\nThe impact of immunosuppression on the severity of COVID-19 disease remains unclear. Data reported from 1099 Chinese patients with COVID-19 did not observe immunodeficiency as a risk factor for severe disease (defined according to the American Thoracic Society guidelines for community acquired pneumonia).

This guidance was last updated by the BSG COVID-19 IBD Working Group on 2 April 2020, and was based on expert opinion and the available evidence at the time. *The UK government advises those at increased risk, but not reaching the highest risk, of severe illness from coronavirus (COVID-19) to be particularly stringent when applying social distancing recommendations. †That is, at least one of (comorbidity listed above or age ≥70 years) plus at least one of (therapy from middle column or moderate to severely active disease). ‡Patients should be categorised as highest risk (requiring shielding) within 6 weeks of starting biologics if they are on concomitant immunomodulator treatment or systemic steroids, whether started simultaneously or prior to the biologic. After 6 weeks they may enter the 'moderate' risk category provided they do not meet other highest risk criteria, for example, moderate-severe disease not controlled by treatment. Biologic plus immunomodulator in stable patients may increase the risk over monotherapy but there is no specific evidence for this situation. §As judged by the clinical team responsible for patient care. ¶Patients who have stopped biologics or immunomodulators should remain within their pre-treatment cessation risk category for 3 months; for drugs with a much shorter half-life (eg, tofacitinib), we advise clinician discretion. 5-ASA, 5-aminosalicylic acid; IBD, inflammatory bowel disease; TNF, tumour necrosis factor. sequential organ failure assessment score (OR 5.65; 95% CI 2.61 to 12.23) and d-dimer >1 µg/mL (OR 18.42; 95% CI 2.64 to 128.55).

Among the 11 patients who died, a range of medications were seen; five patients were receiving mesalazine alone or no therapy, although all were aged 69 years or older; four were receiving steroids alone or in combination; and the youngest patient who died was 33 years and was receiving combination therapy with adalimumab, azathioprine and prednisolone.The British Society of Gastroenterology (BSG), in line with the International Organisation for the Study of IBD and the European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation, recommend that patients with IBD do not routinely stop their medication to prevent infection or adverse outcome with COVID-19. 'Social distancing' (https://www. gov. uk/ government/ publications/ covid-19-guidance-on-social-distancing-andfor-vulnerable-people/ guidance-on-social-distancing-foreveryone-in-the-uk-and-protecting-older-people-and-vulnerable-adults) and 'shielding' (https://www. gov. uk/ government/ publications/ guidance-on-shielding-and-protecting-extremelyvulnerable-persons-from-covid-19/ guidance-on-shielding-andprotecting-extremely-vulnerable-persons-from-covid- [bib_ref] A prospective analysis of the incidence of and risk factors for opportunistic..., Naganuma [/bib_ref] are measures to reduce spread within the population and to protect high risk groups. These are also an understandable source of anxiety for patients with IBD. [bib_ref] Implications of COVID-19 for patients with pre-existing digestive diseases, Mao [/bib_ref] On behalf of the BSG, a UK-wide IBD COVID-19 Working Group has been established and has defined patient risk as highest, moderate and lowest for COVID-19 related poor outcome (see [fig_ref] Table 1: British Society of Gastroenterology inflammatory bowel disease COVID-19 risk grid [/fig_ref] and below for justification of groupings). Patients classified as at highest risk, correspond to group 5 in the UK government's instruction to undergo 'shielding', the most stringent form of isolation. The moderate group are recommended to be even stricter at following the government's instructions regarding social distancing. Note that all patients should still attend for infusions of biologics, irrespective of risk stratification.\nThe UK Department of Health has requested patient contact details from local secondary care IBD services for those that meet the highest risk. A pragmatic approach to identify individuals within the highest risk group has been adopted: 1. Where feasible, national datasets are being interrogated to identify 'highest risk' patients.\n\n## Direct communication with patients via the bsg, and\nCrohn's and Colitis UK workflows. 3. Patients may self-identify into risk group (https://www. ibdregistry. org. uk/ covid-19) and/or contact their local IBD team (ideally by email). 4. Secondary care IBD teams will then provide patient details to the National Health Service (NHS). The self-identification tool (point 3 above) was developed using the information in table 1 in partnership with the IBD Registry as a pragmatic solution to obtain up to date information from UK patients with IBD and maximise the ability to identify patients in the highest risk group. Early identification and intervention (shielding education) to 318 Chinese IBD patients in Hubei at risk of COVID-19 was well received by patients and may have protected them from infection, with none of them reporting infection, as of 28 February 2020.At the time of writing, there is a lot of activity at UK government level around the wearing of masks by the general population in public spaces and hospitals. The BSG recommends members of the public to follow the most up to date advice from the government with respect to this.\nMost IBD patients will fall into the moderate or lowest risk groups. Defining a 'highest risk' group is not exact, with little or no evidence specific to COVID-19. The grouping has therefore been determined following extensive discussion among UK IBD specialists with input from international colleagues. Based on the current evidence, we understand increasing age, heart disease, diabetes and hypertension are the among the greatest risk factors for poor outcome in COVID-19. [bib_ref] Clinical characteristics of coronavirus disease 2019 in China, Guan W-Jie [/bib_ref] [bib_ref] Clinical course and risk factors for mortality of adult inpatients with COVID-19..., Zhou [/bib_ref] [bib_ref] Prevalence of comorbidities in the novel Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) infection: a systematic..., Yang [/bib_ref] [bib_ref] COVID-19 and smoking: a systematic review of the evidence, Vardavas [/bib_ref] [bib_ref] COVID-19: the gendered impacts of the outbreak, Wenham [/bib_ref] As such, priority has been given to these factors alongside medications, other than individuals on high dose steroids (table 1 and below). Where risk is primarily determined by IBD (patient and treatment factors), we recognise this is a dynamic process-that is, patients may move between risk categories over the duration of the pandemic. This is a very busy time for clinical teams with redeployment in order to manage the COVID-19 pandemic. We have therefore aimed for simple clear messages wherever possible. For this reason, we have deliberately not provided a drug by drug description of clearance, and recommend it is 3 months after cessation of a drug therapy before a patient changes risk category. In part, this is to discourage the practice of stopping drugs purely to switch risk category. The exception is steroids, which is covered explicitly in the grid. As a working group, we have had some discussion about tofacitinib which has a much shorter halflife; in this case, we advise clinician discretion regarding the time point at which cessation impacts on risk categorisation.\nWe wish to strongly emphasise: ► Patients should continue their current medications. ► Access to injectable treatment (infliximab, vedolizumab, ustekinumab, adalimumab, certolizumab and golimumab) should be maintained, irrespective of risk category and distancing/isolation recommendations. ► Infusion suite services (with appropriate social distancing methods) should be maintained as a priority area to prevent treatment flare, admission and increased risk of immunogenicity. ► Home care provision of subcutaneous medicines should be maintained as a priority for IBD patients. General advice for all IBD patients is provided in box 1.\n\n## Changes to current primary and secondary care practices\nHospital services are being reorganised to better deal with severe COVID-19 infections. Elective work is being suspended to maximise staffing and space for acute admissions. We also need to be very careful that rapid institution of telemedicine services does not adversely impact on primary care (eg, phlebotomy and drug prescribing).\nConsideration should be given to reorganising services to support well staff working from home when possible, to minimise their own viral exposure. Staff sickness is likely to become a major factor during this pandemic and so efforts should be made to minimise this from the earliest stages.\nPre-symptomatic transmission has been reported, although estimated rates vary between studies. Face to face meetings between staff, particularly in confined spaces, should be minimised and, where necessary, should avoid people being in close proximity if possible. Services such as Microsoft Teams (https:// teams. microsoft. com), WebEx (https://www. webex. com) and Zoom (https:// zoom. us) can be used to facilitate virtual meetings (see also https://www. ecdc. europa. eu/ sites/ default/ files/ documents/ RRA-sixth-update-Outbreak-of-novel-coronavirusdisease-2019-COVID-19. pdf).\n\n## Ibd nurse phone and email helpline\nTo manage and support patients with IBD when outpatient clinics are being converted to telephone review, the minimum service provision needs to include a telephone/email helpline to support patients having disease flares and to answer queries regarding immunosuppressant/biologics management. Ideally, provision should be made for one member of the nursing team to work from home to ensure this is maintained, with appropriate senior review to support the clinical decision making process. This would reduce the burden on both primary and secondary care, in particular the accident and emergency department. This should be supported with capacity for patients to have urgent review if needed in a 'safe clinic'.\nPatients are being asked to keep taking their usual IBD therapy. If patients stop taking their medications without discussing it with their clinical team first, there is a risk of disease flare. Active disease is associated with an increased risk of infection, exposure to steroids (increased risk from infection), hospitalisation and major surgery. \n\n## Outpatient clinics\nConduct clinical appointments by telephone or a formal telemedicine system where possible. Routine bloods may be deferred until the situation has improved, depending on local capacity. Access to faecal calprotectin (FC) testing, a potential alternative to endoscopy, may become limited due to the presence of virus in the stool. If accessible, consider introduction of point of care calprotectin testing. FC point of care kits could be most effectively issued to high risk patients at a new patient/flare clinic or on discharge from hospital (sampling every 2-3 months depending on capacity). Given the limited access to endoscopic disease assessment, the combination of FC and clinical disease scores (eg, partial Mayo/Simple Clinical Colitis Activity Index, Paediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index, Harvey-Bradshaw index or weighted Paediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index) may help to guide treatment decisions more objectively.\n\n## New ibd patients\nIn line with the Joint Advisory Group/BSG endoscopy guidance released on 26 March 2020, all non-emergency endoscopy should stop immediately. Careful case by case discussion will need to be given to decide the timing of diagnostic endoscopy for the most urgent suspected new IBD cases. If centres are delayed in assessing new IBD patients, a telephone triage system should be adopted to assess clinical urgency.\n\n## Urgent outpatient review\nPatients who may require hospitalisation will need to continue to be assessed in a timely manner. Consider the most appropriate location to do this that is away from COVID-19 assessment areas. Daily 'flare clinics' (virtual where possible) with limited numbers of patients who are at high risk of imminent hospitalisation should be considered. Where possible, limit visits to hospital and limit the patient journey around the hospital geographically.\n\n## General considerations regarding ibd medications\n► Balance the risk of immune modifying drugs with the risk associated with active disease. ► Patients are advised not to stop or reduce their medication without discussing with the IBD team, due to the risk of flare leading to a need for steroids or other additional immunosuppression or hospitalisation. ► Immunosuppressive effects of medications may persist for many weeks or months after treatment cessation. ► Identify an experienced/senior person to oversee blood tests, initiation of biologics and prescribing of biologics, and support patients accordingly. Reduce any therapy associated monitoring blood tests to a minimum safe frequency.\n► Administrative support should be identified to ensure prescriptions for subcutaneous biologics are forwarded to home care in a timely manner. ► Patients should be given helpline details to arrange contact for advice regarding delayed deliveries. ► Maintaining a functional infusion service throughout the pandemic should be a priority.\n\n## Therapy specific considerations\nGiven the paucity of data regarding the effects of IBD medications on the course of COVID-19, contributing confirmed cases to the international registry (SECURE-IBD, https:// covidibd. org) is encouraged. ► Corticosteroids -Should be avoided if possible but will still be necessary for some who should then observe 'shielding' while prednisolone dose is ≥20 mg daily. -High dose steroids are an established risk factor for respiratory tract infection and opportunistic infection in IBD and septicaemia. [bib_ref] A prospective analysis of the incidence of and risk factors for opportunistic..., Naganuma [/bib_ref] \n\n## Service considerations\nRemote monitoring of disease activity can be achieved through virtual clinics using blood tests taken at sites remote to the hospital (eg, satellite facilities or via a general practitioner), with standard laboratory or point of care FC monitoring where available.\nThe infusion service is a priority area. Consider moving off site to a 'clean' area if possible or facility with alternative access, avoiding the need to pass through the main hospital. Visitors should no longer be permitted. Patients should not attend for infusion if they are symptomatic for COVID-19 and where possible should be screened on arrival for symptoms and fever. Two metre spacing should be employed between patients, and there should be a dedicated separate waiting area if possible. A strict hand washing policy on arrival should be enforced. Infusion chairs should be appropriately cleaned between patients. Parenteral electrolyte and iron replacement services should be reserved for urgent cases only. If capacity is reduced due to staff shortages, daily/weekly triage of infusions should take place.\n\n## Endoscopy\nThe BSG has provided separate guidance on endoscopy and COVID-19 (https://www. bsg. org. uk/ covid-19-advice/). IBD surveillance procedures should be deferred. IBD disease assessment scopes will need to be carefully assessed for priority. Alternative methods of disease assessment, including the use of biomarkers, radiology and capsule endoscopy should be considered.\n\n## Imaging\nThe capacity for outpatient imaging may be reduced. However, this should be discussed within individual hospitals. Access to different imaging modalities may vary during the pandemic and this may influence the choice of investigation for patients with IBD.\nsurgery Routine elective operations have been deferred in most centres. Where possible, urgent management of perianal sepsis should be undertaken as a day case procedure. Complex IBD surgery should be deferred where possible and its timing should be reviewed regularly at multidisciplinary meetings. Emergency procedures (e.g. subtotal colectomy in acute severe UC, intestinal resection to control penetrating disease in CD) will continue as part of routine care. As with active disease, the choice of postoperative therapy to prevent recurrence will need to be considered in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. If surgery is required for subacute obstructive symptoms, it may be possible to avoid or delay surgery by using partial or exclusive enteral nutrition regimens. 21\n\n## Clinical trials\nThe National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) and Chief Scientist Office (CSO) have produced guidance on the management of clinical trials which will be updated regularly (NIHR https://www. nihr. ac. uk/ news/ dhsc-issues-guidance-on-theimpact-on-covid-19-on-research-funded-or-supported-by-nihr/ 24469; CSO http://www. nhsresearchscotland. co. uk/ news/ covid-19---guidance-for-sponsors-sites-and-researchers). Many trials will have already been paused by their sponsors.\nWhere this has not happened, participant screening, recruitment and continuation (for participants already recruited) should be reviewed at the local level for appropriateness in the current clinical situation. The benefits of avoiding surgery and/or corticosteroids by receiving trial medication that may not be otherwise available must be balanced against the risk of face to face visits and the unknown effects of the investigational medicinal product on the course of COVID-19. Where possible, trial visits should occur virtually, and investigations that require hospital attendance should be postponed unless clinically important. Protocol amendments should be made to the relevant regulatory bodies, and advice should be sought from research and development directors promptly to protect participants, as formal approval may be significantly delayed. Blinded trials pose a particular concern; principal investigators should be prepared to unblind participants where the information will influence the participant's treatment or when assessment and management of coronavirus is being considered. In addition, patients who may be on a placebo medication that does not require self-isolation or social distancing should have this highlighted to them in case they wish to withdraw from a study. Sponsors should consider minimising the burden of administrative tasks while healthcare teams are stretched; many members of the research team are already being redeployed into direct clinical care.\n\n## Advice for nhs staff with ibd\nFrontline staff with IBD should follow the same precautions as other IBD patients. However, given the high risk of exposure of frontline staff to SARS-CoV-2, it would be advisable that hospital teams consider utilising team members with IBD in roles where exposure is limited (i.e. telephone clinics as opposed to endoscopy lists and ward work), especially if that individual is at 'moderate' risk or has other comorbidity, in which case they should be supported in working from home if possible. If it is essential for them to work in a hospital environment, they should ensure they avoid close contact with other staff members and can maintain social distancing.\n\n# Conclusion\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has posed unprecedented challenges to healthcare providers across the globe. The IBD community must continue to demonstrate adaptability in this rapidly moving field. Collaborative working is vital to ensure we gather as much knowledge as possible collectively, sharing ideas to provide the best outcomes for our patients as new evidence emerges.\n[table] Table 1: British Society of Gastroenterology inflammatory bowel disease COVID-19 risk grid: Stratification of risk of serious COVID-19 disease into highest, moderate and lowest risk categories for patients with inflammatory bowel disease [/table]", "source": "pubmed", "question": "According to the British Society of Gastroenterology guidance for management of IBD during the COVID-19 pandemic, discuss how patients should be stratified into highest, moderate and lowest risk categories—detailing the key patient, disease and treatment factors that determine each category—and explain how this risk stratification should guide recommendations on shielding/social distancing, continuation or modification of IBD therapies (including corticosteroids, biologics and immunomodulators), and changes to service provision such as infusion clinic management and remote monitoring."}
{"guideline_text": "Stroke prevention\n\n# Prevention\nPrevention of stroke can work at various levels including:\n- primary prevention - the reduction of risk factors across the board, by public health measures such as reducing smoking and the other behaviours that increase risk;\n- secondary prevention - actions taken to reduce the risk in those who already have disease or risk factors that may have been identified through screening; and\n- tertiary prevention - actions taken to reduce the risk of complications (including further strokes) in people who have already had a stroke.\nThe most important modifiable risk factors for stroke are hypertension, heart disease, diabetes, and cigarette smoking. Other risks include heavy alcohol consumption (see Alcohol consumption and health), high blood cholesterol levels, illicit drug use, and genetic or congenital conditions. Family members may have a genetic tendency for stroke or share a lifestyle that contributes to stroke. Higher levels of Von Willebrand factor are more common amongst people who have had ischemic stroke for the first time. The results of this study found that the only significant genetic factor was the person's blood type. Having had a stroke in the past greatly increases one's risk of future strokes.\nOne of the most significant stroke risk factors is advanced age. 95% of strokes occur in people age 45 and older, and two-thirds of strokes occur in those over the age of 65. A person's risk of dying if he or she does have a stroke also increases with age. However, stroke can occur at any age, including in fetuses.\nSickle cell anemia, which can cause blood cells to clump up and block blood vessels, also increases stroke risk. Stroke is the second leading killer of people under 20 who suffer from sickle-cell anemia.\nMen are 1.25 times more likely to suffer strokes than women, yet 60% of deaths from stroke occur in women. Since women live longer, they are older on average when they have their strokes and thus more often killed (NIMH 2002). Some risk factors for stroke apply only to women. Primary among these are pregnancy, childbirth, menopause and the treatment thereof (HRT).\nPrevention is an important public health concern. Identification of patients with treatable risk factors for stroke is paramount. Treatment of risk factors in patients who have already had strokes (secondary prevention) is also very important as they are at high risk of subsequent events compared with those who have never had a stroke. Medication or drug therapy is the most common method of stroke prevention. Aspirin (usually at a low dose of 75 mg) is recommended for the primary and secondary prevention of stroke.  Also see Antiplatelet drug treatment.  Treating hypertension, diabetes mellitus, smoking cessation, control of  hypercholesterolemia, physical exercise, and avoidance of illicit drugs and excessive alcohol consumption are all recommended ways of reducing the risk of stroke.\nIn patients who have strokes due to abnormalities of the heart, such as atrial fibrillation, anticoagulation with medications such as warfarin is often necessary for stroke prevention.\nProcedures such as carotid endarterectomy or carotid angioplasty can be used to remove significant atherosclerotic narrowing (stenosis) of the carotid artery, which supplies blood to the brain. These procedures have been shown to prevent stroke in certain patients, especially where carotid stenosis leads to ischemic events such as transient ischemic attack. (The value and role of carotid artery ultrasound scanning in screening has yet to be established.)\nA meta-analysis concluded that lowering homocysteine with folic acid and other supplements may reduce stroke. However, the two largest randomized controlled trials included in the meta-analysis had conflicting results. Lonn reported positve results; whereas the trial by Toole was negative.", "source": "wikidoc", "question": "According to authoritative guidelines, discuss a comprehensive approach to stroke prevention across primary, secondary and tertiary levels, specifying which modifiable risk factors to prioritise, the recommended pharmacological interventions (including the roles of low‑dose aspirin and anticoagulation), indications for carotid intervention, special considerations for high‑risk groups (eg older adults, women, and patients with sickle cell disease), and any important areas of uncertainty in the evidence (eg carotid screening and homocysteine‑lowering supplements)."}

{"guideline_text": "TRIP13\nTRIP13 is a mammalian gene that encodes the thyroid receptor-interacting protein 13. In budding yeast, the analog for TRIP13 is PCH2. TRIP13 is a member of the AAA+ ATPase family, a family known for mechanical forces derived from ATP hydrolase reactions. The TRIP13 gene has been shown to interact with a variety of proteins and implicated in a few diseases, notably interacting with the ligand binding domain of thyroid hormone receptors, and may play a role in early-stage non-small cell lung cancer. However, recent evidence implicates TRIP13 in various cell cycle phases, including meiosis G2/Prophase and during the Spindle Assembly checkpoint (SAC). Evidence shows regulation to occur through the HORMA domains, including Hop1, Rev7, and Mad2. Of note, Mad2's involvement in the SAC is shown to be affected by TRIP13  Due to TRIP13's role in cell cycle arrest and progression, it may present opportunity as a therapeutic candidate for cancers.\n\n# Structure\nAs an AAA+ ATPase, TRIP13 (and its PCH2 analog) forms homohexamers and interacts with ATP as an energy source. With respect to Hop1, PCH2 binds to and structurally changes Hop1, displacing the Hop1 from DNA. TRIP13/PCH2 interacts with ATP as a hydrolase, hydrolyzing phosphates to derive energy for conformational changes that can induce mechanical force on its substrate, Hop1 in the previous case. TRIP14/PCH2 is believed to have a single AAA+ ATPase domain. TRIP13/PCH2 also functions as a kinetochore protein that interacts with the silencing protein p31-Comet.\n\n# Role in meiosis G2/prophase\nMeiosis in mammalian cells have a series of checkpoints and steps that need to be properly regulated. TRIP13/PCH2 has been implicated in these processes in budding yeast as well, particularly in the meiosis G2/prophase stage. Double stranded breaks during meiosis is a key part of this phase and is impacted by TRIP13. The homologous recombination that occurs following these breaks requires a protein complex to influence and structure appropriate chromosomal pairing.\nIn a paper by San-Segundo et al., localization assays and induced mutations in PCH2 in budding yeast was shown to be required for the meiotic checkpoint to prevent chromosome segregation when the recombination or chromosome synapsis are defective. TRIP13, PCH2's analog, was also shown to be required for the formation of the synaptonemal complex – the complex that structures chromosomal pairings. Without TRIP13, meiocytes had pericentric synaptic forks, less number of crossovers, and altered distribution of chiasma (the contact point between homologous chromosomes. For this synaptonemal complex (SC) formation, meiotic HORMADS need to be removed. For example, PCH2 was found to be needed to remove Hop1 from chromosomes during SC formation. Other HORMADs, such as HORMAD1 and HORMAD2, are also depleted from the chromosomal pairs with the help of TRIP13 in mice cells. Research shows a robust and varied role for TRIP13/PCH2 to remove various proteins for SC formation, thus allowing meiosis to continue. Further mechanistic evidence is needed to clarify other proteins affected by TRIP13 in meiosis G2/Prophase, and elucidate the wide ability to affect a multitude of proteins.\n\n# Role in spindle assembly complex\nLike its role in meiosis, TRIP13/PCH2 is also implicated in mitosis, particularly in the metaphase-to-anaphase transition and the Spindle Assembly Checkpoint (SAC). Its function also has impacts on the Anaphase Promoting Complex (APC). To continue from metaphase to anaphase, the cell must ensure chromosomes are bioriented and properly structured in order for correct and error-free separation of sister chromatids. This process requires many proteins to ensure dynamic timing and consistent response. In order for progression, the APC must be activated, which upon activation degrade securing. The APC is activated by CDC20, a protein that is silenced by the mitotic checkpoint complex (MCC). Of interest in relation to TRIP13 is Mad2, which has two forms (open O-Mad2 and closed C-Mad2) (2). When kinetochores are unattached, O-Mad2 converts to C-Mad2, which is then able to latch to CDC20, and essentially sequester it preventing mitotic progression.\nProgression requires the disassembly of the MCC, which is found to be mediated by p31-Comet. This is through to occur in part by structural mimicry, where p31-Comet is structurally similar to C-Mad2. However, this process requires ATP, which is where TRIP13/PCH2 comes into play. Evidence shows that TRIP13/PCH2 uses p31-Comet as an adaptor protein to convert C-Mad2 into O-Mad2. However, the connection between TRIP13/PCH2 and the SAC is more nuanced. Experiments in human HeLa and HCT116 cells show that neither p31-Comet nor TRIP13 was particularly required for unperturbed mitosis, and that depleting P31-Comet only slightly impaired Mad2 inactivation. Additionally, research shows that without TRIP13, Mad2 exists exclusively in the closed form. Interestingly, in TRIP13 deficient cells, the SAC was unable to be inactivated and had a relatively short mitosis. This hints at the possibility that activation of the SAC and the formation of the MCC requires not only C-Mad2 but also the conversion of C-Mad2 to O-Mad2.\n\n# Implications in cancer\nGiven TRIP13/PCH2's role in the correct biorientation of chromosomes during mitosis, it is unsurprising that it is connected to several cancers. In one instance, overexpression of TRIP13 has been shown to affect treatment resistance for Squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. Additionally, TRIP13 and Mad2 overexpression are correlated jointly in cancer. In relation to mitotic delays associated with Mad2 overexpression, overexpression of TRIP13 reduced and TRIP13 reduction increased the mitotic delay that Mad2 overexpression brings about. Furthermore, Mad2 over-expression and TRIP13 decrease inhibited proliferation in cells and tumor xenografts – presenting therapeutic value for TRIP13 reduction.", "source": "wikidoc", "question": "According to authoritative guidelines, discuss how TRIP13's mechanistic roles in meiosis G2/prophase and the spindle assembly checkpoint (including its interactions with HORMADs, Hop1/PCH2, Mad2, p31‑Comet, CDC20 and the APC) underpin its potential as a therapeutic target in cancer, and critically appraise the supporting evidence, observed effects of TRIP13 overexpression or depletion on mitotic progression and treatment resistance, and the key limitations or uncertainties noted in the guideline."}
{"guideline_text": "Abdominal aortic aneurysm overview\nSynonyms and keywords: Abdominal aneurysm, aortic; aortic aneurysm, abdominal; AAA; triple A\n\n# Overview\nAn abdominal aortic aneurysm is a localized dilatation of the abdominal aorta, that exceeds the normal diameter of the abdominal aorta by more than 50%.  The normal diameter of an aorta depends on the patient's age, sex, height, weight, race, body surface area, and baseline blood pressure.  On average, the normal diameter of the infrarenal aorta is 2 cm, and therefore a true AAA measures 3.0 cm or more.  Aortic ectasia is a mild generalized dilatation (<50% of the normal diameter of ≤ 2.9 cm) that is due to age-related degenerative changes in the vessel walls.\n\n# Historical Perspective\nThe etymology of the word aneurysm comes from the Greek word for \"dilatation\".  Abdominal aortic aneurysm as a medical condition has been recognized since ancient times, but was not been successfully treated until the early part of the 20th century.  In 1923, Rudolph Matas (who also proposed the concept of endoaneurysmorrhaphy), performed the first successful aortic ligation on a human.  In 1949, Albert Einstein was operated on by Rudolf Nissen by wrapping the aorta with polyethene cellophane, which induced fibrosis and restricted the growth of the aneurysm.  In 1951, Charles Dubost performed the first AAA repair using a homograft. In 1953, Blakemore and Voorhees repaired a ruptured AAA using a Vinyon-N graft (nylon).  In 1962, Javid and Creech reported the technique of endoaneurysmorrhaphy. In 1980, Parodi et al described an endovascular repair.\n\n# Definition\nThe normal diameter of one's aorta depends on the patient's age, sex, height, weight, race, body surface area, and baseline blood pressure.  On average, the normal diameter of the infrarenal aorta (where abdominal aortic aneurysms are located) is 2 cm.  Therefore an abdominal aortic aneurysm is defined as a dilation of 3.0 cm or more.\nAn abdominal aortic aneurysm is to be distinguished from aortic ectasia which is defined as a mild generalized dilatation (<50% of the normal diameter of ≤ 2.9 cm) that is due to age-related degenerative changes in vessel wall.\n\n# Anatomy\nThe aorta below the renal arteries, also known as the infrarenal aorta, is the location of 90% of  abdominal aortic aneurysms.  Other possible locations are suprarenal and pararenal.  The aneurysm can extend to include one or both of the iliac arteries.\n\n# Classification\nAneurysms are usually classified by their shape:\n\n## Fusiform Aneurysms\nMost common type seen in the infrarenal aorta and are diffuse and circumferential.\n\n## Saccular Aneurysms\nInvolve only a portion of the circumference, with a characteristic outpouching of the vessel wall.\n\n# Pathophysiology\nThe underlying pathophysiology of abdominal aortic aneurysm involves genetic influences, smoking, hypertension, hemodynamic influences and underlying atherosclerosis.  In rare instances infection, arteritis, and connective tissue disorders may play a role.\n\n# Causes\nThe most common cause of an AAA is atherosclerosis.\n\n# Differentiating Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm from other Diseases\nAn abdominal aortic aneurysm should be differentiated from other causes of abdominal pain such as acute cholecystitis, gastrointestinal bleeding, perforated peptic ulcer, ischemic bowel, nephrolithiasis, pyelonephritis, appendicitis, cholelithiasis, large bowel obstruction, small bowel obstruction, pancreatitis, musculoskeletal pain, myocardial infarction, and urinary tract infection.\n\n# Epidemiology and Demographics\nAbdominal aortic aneurysm is the 13th leading cause of death in the US.  Abdominal aortic aneurysms are more common in developed countries.  Elderly, caucasian males who are smokers are at higher risk for developing an abdominal aortic aneurysm.\n\n# Risk Factors\n\n## Initial Development\n\n### Smoking\nThe most significant modifiable risk factor for the development of an abdominal aortic aneurysm is smoking which increases the risk of aneurysm development 8 fold.\n\n### Age\nAdvanced age and family history are the strongest non-modifiable risk factors for the development of an abdominal aortic aneurysm.\n\n### Hypercholesterolemia\nHypercholesterolemia and hypertension are risk factors as well.\n\n### Caucasian Race\nCaucasian race is associated with a higher incidence of AAA when compared to non Caucasian race.\n\n## Expansion\nAn increased rate of expansion of abdominal aortic aneurysm is related to systolic hypertension, wide pulse pressure, and ongoing smoking.\n\n## Rupture\nThe risk of abdominal aortic aneurysm rupture is proportional to the size and rate of growth of the aneurysm.  Abdominal aortic aneurysms greater than 5 cm diameter or those that grow faster than 1 cm per year have a significantly increased risk of rupture and are indications for elective operative repair.  Advanced age, female gender, hypertension, active smoking, outpouchings, and mural thrombus are also risk factors for abdominal aortic aneurysm rupture.\n\n# Screening\nApproximately 16% of large abdominal aortic aneurysms (diameter > 5.5 cm) rupture, causing 9,000 AAA-related deaths in the United States per year.  Several studies have shown that screening can drastically reduce the aneurysm rupture rate by 45-49% for men older than 60, and reduce AAA-related mortality by 21-68%.  In a landmark study randomizing 67,800 men, (The Multicenter Aneurysm Screening Study) aneurysm-related mortality was 53% lower in the screening group as compared with control patients.  The United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends one-time screening for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) by ultrasonography in any man aged 65 to 75 who has ever smoked.  The USPSTF makes no recommendation for or against screening for AAA in men aged 65 to 75 who have never smoked.  The USPSTF recommends against routine screening for AAA in women.\n\n# Natural History, Complications and Prognosis\nAbdominal aortic aneurysms expand slowly over time.  An aortic aneurysm can progress to a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm, which is a medical emergency associated with an extremely high mortality.  Serious complications can also occur as a result of an aortic dissection, such as myocardial infarction, shock, stroke, kidney failure, and arterial emboli.  A ruptured AAA carries an overall mortality rate approaching 75%, which is much higher than the mortality rate of 2-6% in those patients who underwent elective surgical repair.   Approximately 16% of large AAAs (diameter >5.5 cm) rupture, causing 9,000 AAA-related deaths in the United States per year.  Several studies have shown that screening can drastically reduce the aneurysm rupture rate by 45-49% for men older than 60, and reduce AAA-related mortality by 21-68%.  The outcome is usually good if an experienced surgeon repairs the aneurysm before it ruptures. Rupture of an abdominal aortic aneurysm is associated with a 60% to 90% mortality before the patient reaches a hospital.  It is associated with a 30% to 80% operative mortality among those patients who survive long enough to undergo surgery.\n\n# History and Symptoms\nGiven that smoking increases the risk of abdominal aortic aneurysm development, a smoking history should be obtained in elderly men.  If a male over the age of 65 has a history of smoking, they should undergo ultrasonography to screen for an abdominal aortic aneurysm.  Abdominal aortic aneurysms are usually asymptomatic until they expand or rupture.  Spontaneous abdominal pain in a patient with a pulsatile epigastric mass or a known AAA may signal rupture into the retroperitoneum or leakage within the aneurysm wall.  If a patient does develop symptoms, the risk of rupture is quite high, which is why symptoms are considered an indication for surgery.  Pain is the most common symptomatic manifestation of AAA.\n\n# Physical Examination\nPhysical examination has a low sensitivity in the detection of small abdominal aortic aneurysms (29-61% for abdominal aortic aneurysms 3.0-3.9 cm in diameter) but has a sensitivity of 76-82% to detect those abdominal aortic aneurysms that are 5.0 cm or larger that may warrant repair.  It is easier to detect a pulsatile mass in thin patients and those who do not have tense abdomens.  Contrary to popular belief, gentle palpation of abdominal aortic aneurysms is safe, and does not precipitate rupture.\n\n# Abdominal X Ray\nPlain abdominal radiographs are obtained in patients with abdominal complaints before the diagnosis of AAA has been made.  It is very difficult to evaluate patients with AAA using plain radiographs, because aortic wall calcification is seen in less than half of the cases with AAA.  However, plain radiographs may be helpful when an aneurysmal aorta appears normal on angiogram, due to thrombus within the sac.\n\n# Abdominal Ultrasound\nAbdominal ultrasound is the standard imaging modality to detect and follow the progression of an abdominal aortic aneurysm.  When performed by an expert, it has a sensitivity and specificity close to 100% and 96%, respectively.  Abdominal ultrasound can also detect mural thrombus, iliac artery aneurysms, and free peritoneal blood.  Patients should fast before examination to optimize image quality.\n\n# Computed Tomography (CT)\nAlthough CT scanning provides detailed anatomic information and is valuable in planning abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, it is not used as a screening tool given the potential nephrotoxicity associated with the dye load, the cost, and the exposure to radiation.\n\n# Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)\nMRI might be a better soft tissue visualizer than ultrasonography and CT, but its limitations limit its usage as a screening tool and as a diagnostic tool during emergencies like ruptured AAA.  However its advantages makes it a good alternative in AAA patients with poor renal function and in elective preoperative evaluation of unruptured AAA.\n\n# Other Imaging Findings\nAngiography is an alternative less often used imaging method for visualization of an abdominal aortic aneurysm.  Angiography is helpful in determining anatomy of aorta precisely.  It can be used preoperatively in case of suspected suprarenal or thoracic aortic aneurysm, femoral or popliteal aneurysm, renal artery stenosis, unexplained renal insufficiency, occlusive ilio-femoral disease, or visceral ischemia.\n\n# Medical Therapy\nRisk factor modification, such as smoking cessation, management of hypertension, and lipid lowering are essential in reducing the risk of development and the rate of progression of abdominal aortic aneurysms.\n\n# Surgery\nIndications for operative repair of an abdominal aortic aneurysm include the presence of symptoms such as back pain, the presence of a rupture or contained rupture, an abdominal aortic aneurysm diameter greater than 5.5 cm, a rate of expansion of greater than 1 cm in one year, and an inflammatory or infectious etiology.  Open surgical repair is favored in young patients as an elective procedure, the presence of an expanding aneurysm, symptomatic aneurysm, or ruptured aneurysm.  An endovascular repair (EVAR) is favored in older patients and high risk patients or those unfit for open repair.  Risk factors for postoperative morbidity and mortality include extensive atheromatous disease, mural calcification, thrombosis, juxtarenal extension of the aneurysm and the presence of inflammatory changes.\n\n# Prevention\nSmoking cessation and blood pressure management are two strategies to reverse modifiable risk factors for the development, progression, and rupture of an abdominal aortic aneurysm.", "source": "wikidoc", "question": "According to authoritative guidelines, discuss the assessment and management of a newly diagnosed asymptomatic 4.2 cm infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm in a 68-year-old man with a history of smoking, including which investigations are indicated for follow‑up and preoperative planning, the modifiable risk‑factor interventions you would advise, and the criteria that would prompt referral for elective repair and choice between open repair and endovascular repair."}
{"guideline_text": "PSMA3\nProteasome subunit alpha type-3 also known as macropain subunit C8 and proteasome component C8 is a protein that in humans is encoded by the PSMA3 gene. This protein is one of the 17 essential subunits (alpha subunits 1-7, constitutive beta subunits 1-7, and inducible subunits including beta1i, beta2i, beta5i) that contributes to the complete assembly of 20S proteasome complex.\n\n# Function\nThe eukaryotic proteasome recognized degradable proteins, including damaged proteins for protein quality control purpose or key regulatory protein components for dynamic biological processes. An essential function of a modified proteasome, the immunoproteasome, is the processing of class I MHC peptides. As a component of alpha ring, proteasome subunit alpha type-3 contributes to the formation of heptameric alpha rings and substrate entrance gate.\n\n# Structure\nThe human protein proteasome subunit alpha type-3 is 28.4 kDa in size and composed of 254 amino acids. The calculated theoretical pI of this protein is 5.08.\n\n## Complex assembly\nThe proteasome is a multicatalytic proteinase complex with a highly ordered 20S core structure. This barrel-shaped core structure is composed of 4 axially stacked rings of 28 non-identical subunits:  the two end rings are each formed by 7 alpha subunits, and the two central rings are each formed by 7 beta subunits. Three beta subunits (beta1, beta2, and beta5) each contains a proteolytic active site and has distinct substrate preferences. Proteasomes are distributed throughout eukaryotic cells at a high concentration and cleave peptides in an ATP/ubiquitin-dependent process in a non-lysosomal pathway.\n\n# Mechanism\nCrystal structures of isolated 20S proteasome complex demonstrate that the two rings of beta subunits form a proteolytic chamber and maintain all their active sites of proteolysis within the chamber. Concomitantly, the rings of alpha subunits form the entrance for substrates entering the proteolytic chamber. In an inactivated 20S proteasome complex, the gate into the internal proteolytic chamber are guarded by the N-terminal tails of specific alpha-subunit. The proteolytic capacity of 20S core particle (CP) can be activated when CP associates with one or two regulatory particles (RP) on one or both side of alpha rings. These regulatory particles include 19S proteasome complexes, 11S proteasome complex, etc. Following the CP-RP association, the confirmation of certain alpha subunits will change and consequently cause the opening of substrate entrance gate. Besides RPs, the 20S proteasomes can also be effectively activated by other mild chemical treatments, such as exposure to low levels of sodium dodecylsulfate (SDS) or NP-14.\n\n# Clinical significance\nThe Proteasome and its subunits are of clinical significance for at least two reasons: (1) a compromised complex assembly or a dysfunctional proteasome can be associated with the underlying pathophysiology of specific diseases, and (2) they can be exploited as drug targets for therapeutic interventions. More recently, more effort has been made to consider the proteasome for the development of novel diagnostic markers and strategies.\nThe proteasomes form a pivotal component for the Ubiquitin-Proteasome System (UPS)  and corresponding cellular Protein Quality Control (PQC). Protein ubiquitination and subsequent proteolysis and degradation by the proteasome are important mechanisms in the regulation of the cell cycle, cell growth and differentiation, gene transcription, signal transduction and apoptosis. Subsequently, a compromised proteasome complex assembly and function lead to reduced proteolytic activities and the accumulation of damaged or misfolded protein species. Such protein accumulation may contribute to the pathogenesis and phenotypic characteristics in neurodegenerative diseases, cardiovascular diseases, inflammatory responses and autoimmune diseases,  and systemic DNA damage responses leading to malignancies.\nSeveral experimental and clinical studies have indicated that aberrations and deregulations of the UPS contribute to the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative and myodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and Pick's disease, Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Huntington's disease, Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease, and motor neuron diseases, polyglutamine (PolyQ) diseases, Muscular dystrophies and several rare forms of neurodegenerative diseases associated with dementia. As part of the Ubiquitin-Proteasome System (UPS), the proteasome maintains cardiac protein homeostasis and thus plays a significant role in cardiac Ischemic injury, ventricular hypertrophy and Heart failure. Additionally, evidence is accumulating that the UPS plays an essential role in malignant transformation. UPS proteolysis plays a major role in responses of cancer cells to stimulatory signals that are critical for the development of cancer. Accordingly, gene expression by degradation of transcription factors, such as p53, c-Jun, c-Fos, NF-κB, c-Myc, HIF-1α, MATα2, STAT3, sterol-regulated element-binding proteins and androgen receptors are all controlled by the UPS and thus involved in the development of various malignancies. Moreover, the UPS regulates the degradation of tumor suppressor gene products such as adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) in colorectal cancer, retinoblastoma (Rb). and von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor (VHL), as well as a number of proto-oncogenes (Raf, Myc, Myb, Rel, Src, Mos, Abl). The UPS is also involved in the regulation of inflammatory responses. This activity is usually attributed to the role of proteasomes in the activation of NF-κB which further regulates the expression of pro inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-β, IL-8, adhesion molecules (ICAM-1, VCAM-1, P-selectin) and prostaglandins and nitric oxide (NO). Additionally, the UPS also plays a role in inflammatory responses as regulators of leukocyte proliferation, mainly through proteolysis of cyclines and the degradation of CDK inhibitors. Lastly, autoimmune disease patients with SLE, Sjogren's syndrome and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) predominantly exhibit circulating proteasomes which can be applied as clinical biomarkers.\nA role of the proteasome subunit alpha type-3 has been linked in underlying mechanisms of human malignancies. It has been suggested that Cables1 as a novel p21 regulator through maintaining p21 stability and supporting the model that the tumor-suppressive function of Cables1 occurs at least in part through enhancing the tumor-suppressive activity of p21. In this process, Cables 1 mechanistically interferes the proteasome subunit alpha type-3 (PMSA3) hereby binding to p21 to induce cell death and inhibit cell proliferation.\n\n# Interactions\nPSMA3 has been shown to interact with\n- CRYAB,\n- PLK1,\n- PSMA6, and\n- Zif268.", "source": "wikidoc", "question": "According to authoritative guidelines, discuss how the structure and role of PSMA3 in 20S proteasome assembly and substrate gating contribute to disease pathogenesis, and outline how these mechanistic insights (including the Cables1–PSMA3–p21 interaction and known protein partners) support the use of PSMA3 or proteasome components as diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets across neurodegenerative, cardiovascular, inflammatory/autoimmune, and malignant conditions."}

{"guideline_text": "Lecithin–cholesterol acyltransferase\nLecithin–cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT, also called phosphatidylcholine–sterol O-acyltransferase) is an enzyme that converts free cholesterol into cholesteryl ester (a more hydrophobic form of cholesterol), which is then sequestered into the core of a lipoprotein particle, eventually making the newly synthesized HDL spherical and forcing the reaction to become unidirectional since the particles are removed from the surface. The enzyme is bound to high-density lipoproteins (HDLs) (alpha-LCAT) and LDLs (beta-LCAT) in the blood plasma. LCAT deficiency can cause impaired vision due to cholesterol corneal opacities, anemia, and kidney damage.

{"guideline_text": "Stress ulcer\n\n# Overview\nStress ulcers are single or multiple mucosal defects which can become complicated by upper gastrointestinal bleeding during the physiologic stress of serious illness.  Ordinary peptic ulcers are found commonly in the gastric antrum and the duodenum whereas stress ulcers are found commonly in fundic mucosa and can be located anywhere within the stomach and proximal duodenum.\n\n# Incidence/Significance\nStress ulcers, as defined by overt bleeding and hemodynamic instability, decreased hemoglobin, and/or need for transfusion, was seen in 1.5% of patients in the 2252 patients in the Canadian Critical Care Trials group study. Patients with stress ulcers have a longer ICU length of stay (upto 8 days) and a higher mortality (upto 4 fold) than compared to patients who do not have stress ulceration and bleeding . While the bleeding and transfusions associated with the stress ulcerations contribute to the increased mortality, the contribution of factors like hypotension, sepsis and respiratory failure to the mortality independently of the stress ulceration cannot be ignored.\n\n# Risk Factors\nRisk factors for stress ulcer formation that have been identified are numerous and varied.  However, two landmark studies and one position paper exist that addresses the topic of risk factors for stress ulcer formation:\n- Non-critically ill medical patients with 2 or more of the following:  respiratory failure, sepsis, heart failure, hepatic encephalopathy, jaundice, renal failure, stroke, hypotension, previous gastrointestinal disease and treatment with corticosteroids, NSAIDS, heparin, or warfarin.\n- In surgical critically ill patients, only those patients who are on a mechanical ventilator for more than 48 hours and/or those with a coagulopathy.\n- The American Society of Health-System Pharmacists guideline recommends against the practice of stress ulcer prophylaxis in non-critically ill patients.\n\n# Diagnosis\nStress ulcer is suspected when there is upper gastrointestinal bleeding in the appropriate clinical setting, for example, when there is upper gastrointestinal bleeding in elderly patients in a surgical intensive care unit (ICU) with heart and lung disease, or when there is upper gastrointestinal bleeding in patients in a medical ICU who require respirators.\nStress ulcer can be diagnosed after the initial management of gastrointestinal bleeding, the diagnosis can be confirmed by upper GI endoscopy.\n\n# The site of ulcerations\nThe ulcerations may be superficial and confined to the mucosa, in which case they are more appropriately called erosions, or they may penetrate deeper into the submucosa. The former may cause diffuse mucosal oozing of blood, whereas the latter may erode into a submucosal vessel and produce frank hemorrhage. \n\n# Lesion of stress ulcers\nThe characteristic lesions may be multiple, superficial mucosal erosions similar to erosive gastroduodenitis. Occasionally, there may be a large acute ulcer in the duodenum (Curling’s ulcer). \nGenerally, there are multiple lesions located mainly in the  stomach and occasionally in the duodenum. They range in depth from mere shedding of the superficial epithelium (erosion) to deeper lesions that involve the entire mucosal thickness (ulceration). \n\n# Stress Ulcer formation\nThe pathogenic mechanisms are similar to those of erosive gastritis.” \nThe pathogenesis of stress ulcer is unclear but probably is related to a reduction in mucosal blood flow or a breakdown in other normal mucosal defense mechanisms in conjunction with the injurious effects of acid and pepsin on the gastroduodenal mucosa. \n\n# Stress Ulcer Prophylaxis (SUP)\nClinical practice guidelines inform prophylaxis decisions.\n\n## Who should be on stress ulcer prophylaxis?\nNot every patient who enters the hospital needs SUP.  Cook et al demonstrated that in surgical critically-ill patients the only risk factors associated with clinically significant bleeding from stress ulcers were mechanical ventilation for more than 48 hours and coagulopathy (OR 15.6 and 4.3, respectively). \n\n## Drug classes and options available\nProphylactic agents include antacids, H2-receptor blockers, sucralfate, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), prostaglandin analogs, and nutrition.\nAmong recent comparisons of prophylactic agents:\n- Systematic reviews find inconsiatent results between proton pump inhibitors and H2-receptor blockers.\n- A more recent randomized controlled trial of proton pump inhibitors versus H2-receptor blockers found no difference but a borderling increase in mortality with PPIs.\n\n### Proton pump inhibitors\nPPIs are also widely used in SUP.  \"Data regarding the efficacy and potential adverse effects of these drugs in the prevention of stress ulceration are less extensive than for antacids, H2 blockers, or sucralfate.\"   In one study looking at omeprazole, patients were given an oral suspension by mouth followed by nasogastric tube and there were no episodes of bleeding or signs of toxicity.    Similar results were reproduced in another study.  \n\n### H2 Receptor antagonists\nIn contrast, H2-receptor blockers are widely used in SUP.  Most trials, but not all, have demonstrated their effectiveness in preventing stress ulcer formation.    \n\n### Sucralfate\nSucralfate has not been shown to effectively decrease the incidence of stress ulcer formation.  This was demonstrated in a large randomized, double-blinded, control trial of 1200 patients and compared sucralfate to the H2-receptor blocker, ranitidine.  \n\n### Prostaglandin analogues\nThis class includes Misoprostol and the likes. Significant side effects including diarrhea, drug interactions, lack of overall efficacy and availability of much better alternatives preclude its use in current medical practice.\n\n### Antacids\nAntacids have been used in SUP.  Numerous studies have shown them to be as effective in prevention when compared to H2-receptor blockers.    One study did show them to be no more effective than placebo.   Overall, all the studies show a trend towards effectiveness when compared to placebo but the effect is not as strong as other H2 receptor antagonists. Additionally, these drugs have other drawbacks such as the need for frequent administration (sometimes as often as every 2-3 hours), electrolyte imbalance, diarrhea, constipation and other important drug interactions. For these reasons, these drugs are no longer used for stress ulcer prophylaxis.\n\n# Treatment\nThe principles of management are the same as for the chronic ulcer.  The steps of management are similar as in erosive gastritis.\nEndoscopic means of treating stress ulceration may be ineffective and operation required.  It is believed that shunting of blood away from the mucosa makes the mucous membrane ischaemic and more susceptible to injury. \nTreatment of stress ulceration usually begins with prevention. Careful attention to respiratory status, acid-base balance, and treatment of other illnesses helps prevent the conditions under which stress ulcers occur. Patients who develop stress ulcers typically do not secrete large quantities of gastric acid; however, acid does appear to be involved in the pathogenesis of the lesions. Thus it is reasonable either to neutralize acid or to inhibit its secretion in patients at high risk. \nIn case of severe hemorrhagic or erosive gastritis and stress ulcers, a combination of antacids and H2-blockers may stop active bleeding and prevent re bleeding. In selected patients, either endoscopic therapy or selective infusion of vasopressin into the left gastric artery may help control the hemorrhage. \n\n# Footnote\n- ↑ Jump up to: 1.0 1.1 Cook, DJ, Fuller, HD, Guyatt, GH, et al.

{"guideline_text": "Apophenia\n\n# Overview\nApophenia is the experience of seeing patterns or connections in random or meaningless data. The term was coined in 1958 by Klaus Conrad, who defined it as the \"unmotivated seeing of connections\" accompanied by a \"specific experience of an abnormal meaningfulness\".\n\"While observations of relevant work environments and human behaviors in these environments is a very important first step in coming to understand any new domain, this activity is in and of its self not sufficient to constitute scientific research. It is fraught with problems of subjective bias in the observer. We (like the experts we study) often see what we expect to see, we interpret the world through our own personal lens. Thus we are extraordinarily open to the trap of apophenia.\"\nIn statistics, apophenia would be classed as a Type I error (false positive, false alarm, caused by an excess in sensitivity). Apophenia is often used as an explanation of some paranormal and religious claims, and can also be used to explain the tendency of humans to believe pseudoscience such as Intelligent design. Apophenia may be linked to psychosis and creativity.\n\n# Origins\nConrad originally described this phenomenon in relation to the distortion of reality present in psychosis, but it has become more widely used to describe this tendency in healthy individuals without necessarily implying the presence of neurological or mental illness.\n\n# Examples\n\n## Pareidolia\nPareidolia is a type of apophenia involving the finding of images or sounds in random stimuli.\n\n## Discordianism\nThe Principia Discordia refers to the act of seeing order which does not really exist as the Aneristic Illusion, and avoiding this illusion is a major tenet of the Discordian religion. The Principia illustrates this with a drawing of five pebbles, and gives several possibilities for the shape (a pentagon, or a star, or disorder). It goes on to state that \"an Illuminated Mind can see all of these, yet he does not insist that any one is really true, or that none at all is true\".\n\n## Dark Side of the Rainbow\nWhen the album Dark Side of the Moon by Pink Floyd is played simultaneously with the 1939 film The Wizard of Oz, numerous images from the film appear to synchronise with the music and lyrics. All band members (save Roger Waters), and engineer Alan Parsons, have firmly stated that the phenomenon is a coincidence.  This effect has often been called Dark Side of the Rainbow. Arguably, playing any two media together will produce an impression of a striking amount of coincidence, which is an example of apophenia.\n\n## Fiction\nPostmodern novelists and film-makers have reflected on apophenia-related phenomena, such as paranoid narrativization or fuzzy plotting (e.g., Vladimir Nabokov's \"Signs and Symbols\", Thomas Pynchon's The Crying of Lot 49 and V., Alan Moore's Watchmen, Umberto Eco's The Name of the Rose and Foucault's Pendulum, William Gibson's Pattern Recognition, James Curcio's Join My Cult, Arturo Pérez-Reverte's The Club Dumas, The Illuminatus! Trilogy by Robert Shea and Robert Anton Wilson, and the films Conspiracy Theory, Darren Aronofsky's π, A Beautiful Mind and The Number 23). As narrative is one of our major cognitive instruments for structuring reality, there is some common ground between apophenia and narrative fallacies such as hindsight bias. Since pattern recognition may be related to plans, goals, and ideology, and may be a matter of group ideology rather than a matter of solitary delusion, the interpreter attempting to diagnose or identify apophenia may have to face a conflict of interpretations.\nThe Question, who is portrayed as a conspiracy theorist in the animated television series Justice League Unlimited, was mentioned to have apophenia. He claimed to see connections between the Girl Scouts and the crop circle phenomenon as well as spy satellites and fluoridated toothpaste.", "source": "wikidoc", "question": "According to authoritative guidelines, discuss how clinicians should conceptualize and assess apophenia in patients reporting pattern-seeking or meaningful connections, and how they should differentiate benign apophenic perception from psychotic delusions—addressing diagnostic indicators, implications for risk and management, and the potential influence of observer/researcher and group-ideological bias."}
{"guideline_text": "Titin\nTitin /ˈtaɪtɪn/, also known as connectin, is a protein that, in humans, is encoded by the TTN gene.  Titin is a giant protein, greater than 1 µm in length, that functions as a molecular spring which is responsible for the passive elasticity of muscle. It is composed of 244 individually folded protein domains connected by unstructured peptide sequences. These domains unfold when the protein is stretched and refold when the tension is removed.\nTitin is important in the contraction of striated muscle tissues. It connects the Z line to the M line in the sarcomere. The protein contributes to force transmission at the Z line and resting tension in the I band region. It limits the range of motion of the sarcomere in tension, thus contributing to the passive stiffness of muscle. Variations in the sequence of titin between different types of muscle (e.g., cardiac or skeletal) have been correlated with differences in the mechanical properties of these muscles.\nTitin is the third most abundant protein in muscle (after myosin and actin), and an adult human contains approximately 0.5 kg of titin.  With its length of ~27,000 to ~33,000 amino acids (depending on the splice isoform), titin is the largest known protein.   Furthermore, the gene for titin contains the largest number of exons (363) discovered in any single gene, as well as the longest single exon (17,106 bp).\n\n# Discovery\nReiji Natori in 1954 was the first to propose an elastic structure in muscle fiber to account for the return to the resting state when muscles are stretched and then released. In 1977, Koscak Maruyama and coworkers isolated an elastic protein from muscle fiber, which they called connectin.  Two years later, Kuan Wang and coworkers identified a doublet band on electrophoresis gel corresponding to a high molecular weight elastic protein, which they named titin.\nSiegfried Labeit in 1990 isolated a partial cDNA clone of titin.  In 1995, Labeit and Bernhard Kolmerer determined the cDNA sequence of human cardiac titin. Labeit and colleagues in 2001 determined the complete sequence of the human titin gene.\n\n# Genomics\nThe human gene encoding for titin is located on the long arm of chromosome 2 and contains 363 exons, which together code for 38,138 residues (4200 kDa). Within the gene are found a large number of PEVK (proline-glutamate-valine-lysine -abundant structural motifs) exons 84 to 99 nucleotides in length which code for conserved 28- to 33-residue motifs which may represent structural units of the titin PEVK spring. The number of PEVK motifs in the titin gene appears to have increased during evolution, apparently modifying the genomic region responsible for titin’s spring properties.\n\n# Isoforms\nA number of titin isoforms are produced in different striated muscle tissues as a result of alternative splicing.  All but one of these isoforms are in the range of ~27,000 to ~36,000 amino acid residues in length. The exception is the small cardiac novex-3 isoform which is only 5,604 amino acid residues in length. The following table lists the known titin isoforms:\n\n# Structure\nTitin is the largest known protein; its human variant consists of 34,350 amino acids, with the molecular weight of the mature \"canonical\" isoform of the protein being approximately 3,816,188.13  Da. Its mouse homologue is even larger, comprising 35,213 amino acids with a MW of 3,906,487.6 Da. It has a theoretical isoelectric point of 6.01. The protein's empirical chemical formula is C169,719H270,466N45,688O52,238S911. It has a theoretical instability index (II) of 42.41, classifying the protein as unstable. The protein's in vivo half-life, the time it takes for half of the amount of protein in a cell to break down after its synthesis in the cell, is predicted to be approximately 30 hours (in mammalian reticulocytes).\nThe titin protein is located between the myosin thick filament and the Z disk. Titin consists primarily of a linear array of two types of modules, also referred to as protein domains (244 copies in total): type I fibronectin type III domain (132 copies) and type II immunoglobulin domain (112 copies).  However, the exact number of these domains is different in different species. This linear array is further organized into two regions:\n- N-terminal I-band: acts as the elastic part of the molecule and is composed mainly of type II modules.  More specifically the I-band contains two regions of tandem type II immunoglobulin domains on either side of a PEVK region which is rich in proline (P), glutamate (E), valine (V) and lysine (K).\n- C-terminal A-band: is thought to act as a protein-ruler and is composed of alternating type I and II modules with super-repeat segments. These have been shown to align to the 43 nm axial repeats of myosin thick filaments with immunoglobulin domains correlating to myosin crowns.\nThe C-terminal region also contains a serine kinase domain that is primarily known for adapting the muscle to mechanical strain. It is “stretch-sensitive” and helps repair overstretching of the sarcomere.\nThe elasticity of the PEVK region has both entropic and enthalpic contributions and is characterized by a polymer persistence length and a stretch modulus. At low to moderate extensions PEVK elasticity can be modeled with a standard worm-like chain (WLC) model of entropic elasticity. At high extensions PEVK stretching can be modeled with a modified WLC model that incorporates enthalpic elasticity. The difference between low-and high- stretch elasticity is due to electrostatic stiffening and hydrophobic effects.\n\n# Evolution\nThe titin domains have evolved from a common ancestor through many gene duplication events. Domain duplication was facilitated by the fact that most domains are encoded by single exons.\nTitin has homologs in invertebrates, such as twitchin and projectin, which also contain Ig and FNIII repeats and a protein kinase domain. The gene duplication events took place independently but were from the same ancestral Ig and FNIII domains. It is said that the protein titin was the first to diverge out of the family.\n\n# Function\nTitin is a large abundant protein of striated muscle. Titin's primary functions are to stabilize the thick filament, center it between the thin filaments, prevent overstretching of the sarcomere, and to recoil the sarcomere like a spring after it is stretched. An N-terminal Z-disc region and a C-terminal M-line region bind to the Z-line and M-line of the sarcomere, respectively, so that a single titin molecule spans half the length of a sarcomere. Titin also contains binding sites for muscle-associated proteins so it serves as an adhesion template for the assembly of contractile machinery in muscle cells. It has also been identified as a structural protein for chromosomes. Considerable variability exists in the I-band, the M-line and the Z-disc regions of titin. Variability in the I-band region contributes to the differences in elasticity of different titin isoforms and, therefore, to the differences in elasticity of different muscle types. Of the many titin variants identified, five are described with complete transcript information available.\nTitin interacts with many sarcomeric proteins including:\n- Z line region: telethonin and alpha-actinin\n- I band region: calpain-3 and obscurin\n- M line region: myosin-binding protein C, calmodulin 1, CAPN3, and MURF1\n\n# Clinical relevance\nMutations anywhere within the unusually long sequence of this gene can cause premature stop codons or other defects.  Titin mutations are associated with hereditary myopathy with early respiratory failure, early-onset myopathy with fatal cardiomyopathy, core myopathy with heart disease, centronuclear myopathy,  limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2J, familial dilated cardiomyopathy 9, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and tibial muscular dystrophy. Further research also suggests that no genetically linked form of any dystrophy or myopathy can be safely excluded from being caused by a mutation on the TTN gene.  Truncating mutations in dilated cardiomyopathy patients are most commonly found in the A region; although truncations in the upstream I region might be expected to prevent translation of the A region entirely, alternative splicing creates some transcripts that do not encounter the premature stop codon, ameliorating its effect.\nAutoantibodies to titin are produced in patients with the autoimmune disease scleroderma.\n\n# Interactions\nTitin has been shown to interact with:\n- ANK1,\n- ANKRD1,\n- ANKRD23\n- CAPN3,\n- FHL2,\n- OBSCN,\n- TCAP, and\n- TRIM63.\n\n# Linguistic significance\nThe name titin is derived from the Greek Titan (a giant deity, anything of great size).\nAs the largest known protein, titin also has the longest IUPAC name of a protein. The full chemical name of the human canonical form of titin, which starts methionyl... and ends ...isoleucine, contains 189,819 letters and is sometimes stated to be the longest word in the English language, or of any language. However, lexicographers regard generic names of chemical compounds as verbal formulae rather than English words. The full word can be found here on Wiktionary.", "source": "wikidoc", "question": "According to authoritative guidelines, discuss how titin’s modular domain architecture, alternative splicing–generated isoform variability (including the PEVK region), and sarcomeric localization (Z‑line to M‑line) account for its role in passive muscle elasticity and force transmission across different striated muscle types, and explain how the location of truncating TTN mutations (for example in the I‑band versus A‑band) influences their pathogenic effects and clinical phenotypes such as dilated cardiomyopathy and other titin‑related myopathies."}

Resulting oligohydramnios can be associated with fetal lung hypoplasia and skeletal deformations. Potential neonatal adverse effects include skull hypoplasia, anuria, hypotension, renal failure, and death. When pregnancy is detected, discontinue captopril as soon as possible. These adverse outcomes are usually associated with use of these drugs in the second and third trimester of pregnancy. Most epidemiologic studies examining fetal abnormalities after exposure to antihypertensive use in the first trimester have not distinguished drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin system from other antihypertensive agents. Appropriate management of maternal hypertension during pregnancy is important to optimize outcomes for both mothers and fetus.\nIn the unusual case that there is no appropriate alternative to therapy with drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin system for a particular patient, apprise the mother of the potential risk to the fetus. Perform serial ultrasound examinations to assess the intra-amniotic environment. If oligohydramnios is observed, discontinue, captopril unless it is considered lifesaving for the mother. Fetal testing may be appropriate, based on the week of pregnancy. Patients and physicians should be aware, however, that oligohydramnios may not appear until after the fetus has sustained irreversible injury. Closely observe infants with histories of in utero exposure to captopril for hypotension, oliguria, and hyperkalemia.\nWhen captopril was given to rabbits at doses about 0.8 to 70 times (on a mg/kg basis) the maximum recommended human dose, low incidences of craniofacial malformations were seen. No teratogenic effects of captopril were seen in studies of pregnant rats and hamsters. On a mg/kg basis, the doses used were up to 150 times (in hamsters) and 625 times (in rats) the maximum recommended human dose.\n\n# Adverse Reactions\n\n## Clinical Trials Experience\n\n## Postmarketing Experience\n(Description)\n\n# Drug Interactions\n- Drug 1\n- Drug 2\n- Drug 3\n- Drug 4\n- Drug 5\n(Description)\n(Description)\n(Description)\n(Description)\n(Description)\n\n# Use in Specific Populations\n\n### Pregnancy\n(Description)\n(Description)\n\n### Labor and Delivery\n(Description)\n\n### Nursing Mothers\n(Description)\n\n### Pediatric Use\n(Description)\n\n### Geriatic Use\n(Description)\n\n### Gender\n(Description)\n\n### Race\n(Description)\n\n### Renal Impairment\n(Description)\n\n### Hepatic Impairment\n(Description)\n\n### Females of Reproductive Potential and Males\n(Description)\n\n### Immunocompromised Patients\n(Description)\n\n### Others\n(Description)\n\n# Administration and Monitoring\n\n### Administration\n(Oral/Intravenous/etc)\n\n### Monitoring\n(Description regarding monitoring, from Warnings section)\n(Description regarding monitoring, from Warnings section)\n(Description regarding monitoring, from Warnings section)\n\n# IV Compatibility\n\n## Solution\n\n### Compatible\n- Solution 1\n- Solution 2\n- Solution 3\n\n### Not Tested\n- Solution 1\n- Solution 2\n- Solution 3\n\n### Variable\n- Solution 1\n- Solution 2\n- Solution 3\n\n### Incompatible\n- Solution 1\n- Solution 2\n- Solution 3\n\n## Y-Site\n\n### Compatible\n- Solution 1\n- Solution 2\n- Solution 3\n\n### Not Tested\n- Solution 1\n- Solution 2\n- Solution 3\n\n### Variable\n- Solution 1\n- Solution 2\n- Solution 3\n\n### Incompatible\n- Solution 1\n- Solution 2\n- Solution 3\n\n## Admixture\n\n### Compatible\n- Solution 1\n- Solution 2\n- Solution 3\n\n### Not Tested\n- Solution 1\n- Solution 2\n- Solution 3\n\n### Variable\n- Solution 1\n- Solution 2\n- Solution 3\n\n### Incompatible\n- Solution 1\n- Solution 2\n- Solution 3\n\n## Syringe\n\n### Compatible\n- Solution 1\n- Solution 2\n- Solution 3\n\n### Not Tested\n- Solution 1\n- Solution 2\n- Solution 3\n\n### Variable\n- Solution 1\n- Solution 2\n- Solution 3\n\n### Incompatible\n- Solution 1\n- Solution 2\n- Solution 3\n\n## TPN/TNA\n\n### Compatible\n- Solution 1\n- Solution 2\n- Solution 3\n\n### Not Tested\n- Solution 1\n- Solution 2\n- Solution 3\n\n### Variable\n- Solution 1\n- Solution 2\n- Solution 3\n\n### Incompatible\n- Solution 1\n- Solution 2\n- Solution 3\n\n# Overdosage\n\n## Acute Overdose\n\n### Signs and Symptoms\n(Description)\n\n### Management\n(Description)\n\n## Chronic Overdose\n\n### Signs and Symptoms\n(Description)\n\n### Management\n(Description)\n\n# Pharmacology\n\n## Mechanism of Action\n(Description)\n\n## Structure\n(Description with picture)\n\n## Pharmacodynamics\n(Description)\n\n## Pharmacokinetics\n(Description)\n\n## Nonclinical Toxicology\n(Description)\n\n# Clinical Studies\n(Description)\n(Description)\n(Description)\n\n# How Supplied\n(Description)\n\n# Images\n\n## Drug Images\n\n## Package and Label Display Panel\n\n# Patient Information\n\n## Patient Information from FDA\n(Patient Counseling Information)\n\n## Patient Information from NLM\n(Link to patient information page)\n\n# Precautions with Alcohol\nAlcohol-Sandbox Captopril tablet interaction has not been established.

{"guideline_text": "T he increasing public interest in fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) raises serious concerns, when the application of this treatment is still in its infancy and long-term safety is not yet established. Indeed, there is evidence that anecdotal reports of success from initial results of uncontrolled studies are encouraging patients to try this line of treatment in the absence of medical direction or supervision. It is important that medical practitioners, the media and the general public are made aware of the safety issues involved in 'stool transplant'. While FMT has been widely used in veterinary practice and the exchange of intestinal contents in humans is documented back to the fouth century (1), this intervention requires the exchange of body fluids with all its known and unknown risks. In the early 1980s in Canada, tainted blood and blood products for the treatment of hemophilia led to the serious outbreak of hepatitis C and HIV (2). The stool microbiome is complex, containing, bacterial, viral and fungal components in addition to prions and potentially unknown biologically active substances (3,4). Several excellent studies have indicated the important role of the microbiome in a variety of diseases. In addition to Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), these include obesity, diabetes and behavioural disorders (5). There is an urgent requirement for further careful prospective and controlled research in a variety of these diseases but especially to protect the safety of patients who, understandably, may be frustrated with the poor efficacy of their current treatments. Here, we consider the evidence for the use of FMT in resistant C difficile infection and its current status as an intervention in IBD, together with a brief summary of the current evidence for the safety of FMT and recommendations for the future.\n\n# AnTIBIOTIC-reSISTAnT CDI\nThe incidence of CDI has increased approximately 20-fold over the past 10 years, and rates are currently approximately 20 per 100,000 population (6). There are a number of risk factors for infection including antibiotic use, inflammatory bowel disease, comorbidities and increasing age (7). Proton pump inhibitors have also been implicated in CDI (8,9) although this association remains controversial (10). The rising incidence of CDI has been associated with the emergence of more pathogenic strains and this has led to an increase in mortality related to the infection (11). The efficacy of traditional antibiotic therapy for CDI has declined in recent years and this amplifies the problems of increasing incidence and severity of the infection. Metronidazole is recommended as first line and vancomycin as second line therapy for CDI (12). The infection can recur in up to 30% of cases (13) and after one relapse the risk of a further episode is dramatically increased (14). Treatment with newer antibiotics such as fidaxomicin (15) has been suggested but a key focus for clinicians has been the emerging evidence that fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) is effective in antibiotic resistant CDI (16). A systematic review (17) of case series reported that there were 11 studies involving 273 antibiotic resistant CDI patients and FMT was successful in 89% (95% confidence intervals  = 84% to 93%). We have conducted a literature search to assess the evidence that has accumulated after the search date of the original systematic review. We used the same eligibility criteria as the original systematic review and in particular we excluded case series with less than 10 patients to reduce the possibility of overestimating the treatment effect due to the inherent bias of publishing case reports and very small positive case series. We identified five additional case series (18)(19)(20)(21)(22) that have assessed the efficacy of FMT in antibiotic resistant CDI. Overall, there are now 526 patients with antibiotic resistant CDI described in 16 case series. Of these 459 responded to treatment, giving a response rate of 88% (95% CI = 83% to 92%) with rates varying between 69% and 100% (Figure 1). There is also one small randomized controlled trial (RCT) (23) that randomly assigned antibiotic resistant CDI patients to vancomycin alone (13 patients), vancomycin plus bowel lavage (13 patients) or FMT (16 patients). There was a statistically significant benefit in the FMT group, with 81% in remission after the first transplant and 94% if those who underwent a second transplant were included.\nThe evidence base for FMT consists of one small RCT and 16 case series and, therefore, it is likely that the figure of 88% response rate may be an overestimate. The effect is dramatic; however, it is very likely that FMT is effective in CDI and is a viable option in patients who experience a relapse after two courses of antibiotics.\nThere is growing evidence that the intestinal microbiota plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of IBD. However, only limited evidence supports the efficacy of either probiotic or antibiotic therapy. Accordingly, there is considerable clinical interest in the use of FMT to alter the microbiome and improve the long-term course of IBD (24). Since the first case report of successful FMT for IBD was published 25 years ago (25), only small case series have been reported, and with mixed results. Borody et al (26) reported outcomes for six patients with refractory ulcerative colitis (UC) who were treated with daily FMT for five days, administered by retention enema. Remarkably, all patients achieved drug-free remission within four months and had no recurrence over one to 13 years of follow-up. In contrast, Angelberger et al (27) reported clinical improvement (but not remission) at 12 weeks in only one of five patients with similarly refractory UC who received FMT via nasojejunal infusion and retention enema on three consecutive days. Kump et al (28) also reported disappointing results in six active UC patients given FMT by colonoscopy as a single infusion. Despite short-term clinical improvement over two weeks none of the patients achieved clinical remission. Kunde et al (29) treated 10 children and young adults (age 7 to 21 years) with refractory UC with daily FMT for five days. Of nine patients who could retain the enemas, clinical response was seen at one week in 7 (78%) and at one month in 6 (67%). Interestingly, both Angelberger and Kunde reported transient fever after FMT in 5/5 and 2/9 patients, respectively.\nAlthough these observational data suggest some patients with UC might respond to FMT, it is impossible to make any conclusion about efficacy without properly designed randomized controlled trials. At present six such protocols are registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT01793831, NCT01896635, NCT01961492, NCT01790061, NCT01650038, NCT01545908), but no results have yet been reported. It should be noted that there is even more limited observational experience with FMT in Crohn disease, and no clinical trials for this indication have been registered. In the absence of controlled data showing clear efficacy, FMT should only be performed for treatment of IBD (CD or UC) in the setting of a clinical trial.\n\n# SAfeTy Of fMT\nAlthough the rate of adverse events appears to be low no studies to date have formally sought adverse events prospectively. A recent review suggested that FMT administered via a nasogastric or nasojejunal tube could be associated with an increased risk of adverse events, which included an upper gastrointestinal bleed, peritonitis and enteritis (17). This was based on indirect comparison between case series and more data are needed on the safety of FMT.\nCurrently, there is rigorous screening of stool donors to exclude infectious disease but transmission of a communicable disease remains a concern and there have been case reports of norovirus being transmitted by FMT (30,31). Screening protocols for FMT donors vary widely between reports, despite calls for standardization (32,33), and this is in contrast to protocols for blood donation. Indeed, for anonymous 'universal' donors it is not known how frequently they should be re-screened. Moreover, it is unclear what other conditions should be considered at screening, such as prior use of antibiotics, morbid obesity, metabolic syndrome, atopy, or mood (34). The literature is not clear regarding long-term follow-up for adverse events, which have usually been spontaneously reported rather than actively sought. This increases the risk of under reporting. RCTs and long-term adverse outcome registries have been recommended to define better the short and long-term risks of FMT (13,17).\nUntil the appropriate information becomes available, patients undergoing FMT, when no alternative treatment exists, should be carefully counseled on the known and possibility of unknown risks when they give informed consent to the procedure. Safety of FMT in immunosuppressed patients has not yet been formally studied and these may form a special at-risk population although some patients on a variety of immunosuppressive treatments have undergone FMT in open studies without apparent serious outcome. In one series of 77 cases, four cases of autoimmune disease were reported (34)\nFMT is emerging as an important therapeutic option to manipulate the gut microbiome. Currently there is sufficient evidence to recommend FMT in patients with CDI that have failed or had recurrent infection after two rounds of different antibiotics (usually metronidazole and vancomycin). This intervention should only be performed by health care practitioners experienced in giving FMT using donors that are healthy and are extensively screened for communicable diseases.\nThere is currently insufficient evidence to recommend FMT for patients with IBD and this should only be given in the context of a clinical study. Although not considered here, other potential indications for FMT are not supported by evidence and should only be explored as part of a research protocol.\nThere is an urgent need to standardize how FMT donors are screened and we recommend that all groups undertaking therapeutic FMT should set up prospective adverse events registries to follow patients in the short and long term.\n\n# CAnADIAn ASSOCIATIOn Of GASTrOenTerOlOGy STATeMenT\nThis position paper has been developed under the direction of Drs Paul Moayyedi, John Marshall, Yuhong Yuan and Richard Hunt in accordance with the policies and procedures of the Canadian Association of Gastroenterology (CAG) and under the direction of CAG Clinical Affairs.

It is characterized by motor symptoms such as bradykinesia, rigidity, and tremor, but also cognitive and comunicative symptoms such as facial masking and dysarthria. These primary symptoms are the results of decreased stimulation of the motor cortex by the basal ganglia, normally caused by the insufficient formation and action of dopamine. Diagnosis is mainly clinical, it may be supported by MRI findings and dopamine transporter single-photon emission computed tomography (DaT SPECT), but definitive diagnosis is made by autopsy. The mainstay of therapy for motor symptoms of Parkinson disease are: Levodopa, dopamine agonists, monoamine oxidase (MAO) B inhibitors, anticholinergic agents, amantadine, catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT) inhibitors, estrogen and other drugs such as Exenatide, uric acid, isradipine, nilotinib and GDNF infusion.

{"guideline_text": "Bronchus\n\n# Overview\nA bronchus (plural bronchi, adjective bronchial) is a caliber of airway in the respiratory tract that conducts air into the lungs. No gas exchange takes place in this part of the lungs.\n\n# Anatomy\nThe trachea (windpipe) divides into two main bronchi (also mainstem bronchi), the left and the right, at the level of the sternal angle. The right main bronchus is wider, shorter, and more vertical than the left main bronchus.  The right main bronchus subdivides into three segmental bronchi while the left main bronchus divides into two.  The lobar bronchi divide into tertiary bronchi.  Each of the segmental bronchi supplies a bronchopulmonary segment.  A bronchopulmonary segment is a division of a lung that is separated from the rest of the lung by a connective tissue septum.  This property allows a bronchopulmonary segment to be surgically removed without affecting other segments.  There are ten segments per lung, but due to anatomic development, several segmental bronchi in the left lung fuse, giving rise to eight.  The segmental bronchi divide into many primary bronchioles which divide into terminal bronchioles, each of which then gives rise to several respiratory bronchioles, which go on to divide into 2 to 11 alveolar ducts.  There are 5 or 6 alveolar sacs associated with each alveolar duct.  The alveolus is the basic anatomical unit of gas exchange in the lung.\nThere is hyaline cartilage present in the bronchi, present as irregular rings in the larger bronchi (and not as regular as in the trachea), and as small plates and islands in the smaller bronchi. Smooth muscle is present continuously around the bronchi.\nIn the mediastinum, at the level of the fifth thoracic vertebra, the trachea divides into the right and left primary bronchi. The bronchi branch into smaller and smaller passageways until they terminate in tiny air sacs called alveoli.\nThe cartilage and mucous membrane of the primary bronchi are similar to that in the trachea. As the branching continues through the bronchial tree, the amount of hyaline cartilage in the walls decreases until it is absent in the smallest bronchioles. As the cartilage decreases, the amount of smooth muscle increases. The mucous membrane also undergoes a transition from ciliated pseudostratified columnar epithelium to simple cuboidal epithelium to simple squamous epithelium.\nThe alveolar ducts and alveoli consist primarily of simple squamous epithelium, which permits rapid diffusion of oxygen and carbon dioxide. Exchange of gases between the air in the lungs and the blood in the capillaries occurs across the walls of the alveolar ducts and alveoli.\n\n# Role in disease\nBronchitis is defined as inflammation of the bronchi. There are two main types: acute and chronic. Acute bronchitis is usually caused by viral or bacterial infections. Chronic bronchitis is a form of COPD, usually associated with smoking or long-term exposure to irritants.\nAsthma is hyperreactivity of the bronchi with an inflammatory component, often in response to allergens.\nWhile the left mainstem bronchus departs from the trachea at an angle, the right mainstem bronchus is almost a vertical continuation of the trachea.  This anatomy predisposes the right lung to several problems:\n- If food, liquids, or foreign bodies are aspirated, they often will lodge in the right mainstem bronchus.  Aspiration pneumonia may result.\n- If the endotracheal tube used for intubation is inserted too far, it usually lodges in the right mainstem bronchus. This allows ventilation of the right lung, but leaves the left lung useless.\n- Patients with inadequate cough reflexes may develop chronic right middle lobe lung infections such as the Lady Windermere Syndrome.\n\n# Additional images\n- Cross sectional cut of a human secondary bronchus\n- Transverse section of thorax, showing relations of pulmonary artery.", "source": "wikidoc", "question": "According to authoritative guidelines, discuss how the anatomy of the bronchi—including differences between the right and left main bronchi, the bronchopulmonary segmental organization, and the changes in cartilage, smooth muscle, and epithelium along the bronchial tree—explains (a) the clinical predisposition to right-sided aspiration and endotracheal tube malpositioning, (b) the rationale for surgical resection of bronchopulmonary segments, and (c) how these anatomic features relate to the pathophysiology and clinical presentation of bronchitis, chronic bronchitis/COPD, and asthma."}

{"guideline_text": "Lamivudine zidovudine warnings and precautions\n\n# Warnings And Precautions\n\n## Hemotologic Toxicity/Bone Marrow Suppression\nZidovudine, a component of COMBIVIR, has been associated with hematologic toxicity including neutropenia and anemia, particularly in patients with advanced HIV-1 disease. COMBIVIR should be used with caution in patients who have bone marrow compromise evidenced by granulocyte count less than 1,000 cells/mm3 or hemoglobin less than 9.5 g/dL .\nFrequent blood counts are strongly recommended in patients with advanced HIV-1 disease who are treated with COMBIVIR. Periodic blood counts are recommended for other HIV-1-infected patients. If anemia or neutropenia develops, dosage interruption may be needed.\n\n## Myopathy\nMyopathy and myositis, with pathological changes similar to that produced by HIV-1 disease, have been associated with prolonged use of zidovudine, and therefore may occur with therapy with COMBIVIR.\n\n## Lactic Acidosis/Hepatomegaly With Steatosis\nLactic acidosis and hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogues alone or in combination, including lamivudine, zidovudine, and other antiretrovirals. A majority of these cases have been in women. Obesity and prolonged nucleoside exposure may be risk factors. Particular caution should be exercised when administering COMBIVIR to any patient with known risk factors for liver disease; however, cases have also been reported in patients with no known risk factors. Treatment with COMBIVIR should be suspended in any patient who develops clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity (which may include hepatomegaly and steatosis even in the absence of marked transaminase elevations).\n\n## Patients With HIV-1 and Hepatitis B Virus Co-infection\nPosttreatment Exacerbations of Hepatitis: In clinical trials in non-HIV-1-infected patients treated with lamivudine for chronic HBV, clinical and laboratory evidence of exacerbations of hepatitis have occurred after discontinuation of lamivudine. These exacerbations have been detected primarily by serum ALT elevations in addition to re-emergence of hepatitis B viral DNA (HBV DNA). Although most events appear to have been self-limited, fatalities have been reported in some cases. Similar events have been reported from post-marketing experience after changes from lamivudine-containing HIV-1 treatment regimens to non-lamivudine-containing regimens in patients infected with both HIV-1 and HBV. The causal relationship to discontinuation of lamivudine treatment is unknown. Patients should be closely monitored with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months after stopping treatment. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether re-initiation of lamivudine alters the course of posttreatment exacerbations of hepatitis.\nImportant Differences Among Lamivudine-Containing Products: COMBIVIR Tablets contain a higher dose of the same active ingredient (lamivudine) than EPIVIR-HBV®(lamivudine) Tablets and Oral Solution. EPIVIR-HBV was developed for treating chronic hepatitis B. Safety and efficacy of lamivudine have not been established for treatment of chronic hepatitis B in patients co-infected with HIV-1 and HBV.\nEmergence of Lamivudine-Resistant HBV: In non-HIV-infected patients treated with lamivudine for chronic hepatitis B, emergence of lamivudine-resistant HBV has been detected and has been associated with diminished treatment response (see full prescribing information for EPIVIR-HBV for additional information). Emergence of hepatitis B virus variants associated with resistance to lamivudine has also been reported in HIV-1-infected patients who have received lamivudine-containing antiretroviral regimens in the presence of concurrent infection with hepatitis B virus.\n\n## Use With Other, Lamivudine-, Zidovudine-, and/or Emtricitabine-Containing Products\nCOMBIVIR is a fixed-dose combination of lamivudine and zidovudine.

Although no evidence of a pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interaction (e.g., loss of HIV-1/HCV virologic suppression) was seen when ribavirin was coadministered with lamivudine or zidovudine in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients , hepatic decompensation (some fatal) has occurred in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy for HIV-1 and interferon alfa with or without ribavirin. Patients receiving interferon alfa with or without ribavirin and COMBIVIR should be closely monitored for treatment-associated toxicities, especially hepatic decompensation, neutropenia, and anemia. Discontinuation of COMBIVIR should be considered as medically appropriate. Dose reduction or discontinuation of interferon alfa, ribavirin, or both should also be considered if worsening clinical toxicities are observed, including hepatic decompensation (e.g., Child-Pugh greater than 6) (see the complete prescribing information for interferon and ribavirin).\nExacerbation of anemia has been reported in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving ribavirin and zidovudine. Co-administration of ribavirin and zidovudine is not advised.\n\n## Pancreatitis\nCOMBIVIR should be used with caution in patients with a history of pancreatitis or other significant risk factors for the development of pancreatitis.

{"guideline_text": "Mysophobia\n\n# Background\nMysophobia is a penis. Someone who has such a fear is often referred to as a \"mysophobe\".   The term was introduced by  William A. Hammond in 1879   when describing a case of obsessive compulsive disorder exhibited in repeated washing one's hands.\nThis phobia is sometimes referred to as germophobia (or germaphobia), a combination of germ and phobia to mean fear of germs, as well as bacillophobia and bacterophobia.\nMysophobia has long been related to OCD or washing one's hands, however Harry Stack Sullivan,  an American psychologist and psychoanalyst, notes that while fear of dirt underlies the compulsion of a person with this kind of OCD, their mental state is not about germs, it is about the hands must be washed. \nSeveral well known individuals have suffered from this disorder including Howie Mandel, Cameron Diaz, and Nicola Tesla.", "source": "wikidoc", "question": "According to authoritative guidelines, discuss how clinicians should assess and differentiate mysophobia from obsessive–compulsive disorder (particularly washing-type OCD), including key historical and clinical features to elicit, and outline evidence‑based management principles tailored to whether the patient's fear is germ‑focused versus a compulsion-driven need to wash."}
{"guideline_text": "Leucocyte\nLeukocytosis is an elevation of the white blood cell count (the leukocyte count) above the normal range.\nAlthough it may be a sign of illness, leukocytosis in-and-of itself is not a disorder, nor is it a disease.  It is simply a laboratory finding.\nA leukocyte count above 25 to 30 x 109/L is termed a leukemoid reaction, which is the reaction of a healthy bone marrow to extreme stress, trauma, or infection. (It is different from leukemia and from leukoerythroblastosis, in which immature blood cells are present in peripheral blood.)\n\n# Leukocyte counts\nThe normal adult human leukocyte count in peripheral blood is 4.4-10.8 x 109/L. A white blood cell count of 11.0 x 109/L or more suggests leukocytosis.\n\n# Causes\nLeukocytosis is very common in acutely ill patients. It occurs in response to a wide variety of conditions, including viral, bacterial, fungal, or parasitic infection, cancer, hemorrhage, and exposure to certain medications or chemicals including steroids.  Leukocytosis can also be the first indication of neoplastic growth of leukocytes.\nFor lung diseases such as pneumonia and tuberculosis, WBC count are very important for the diagnosis of the disease,as leucocytosis is usually present.\nThe mechanism that causes leukocytosis can be of several forms: an increased release of leukocytes from bone marrow storage pools, decreased margination of leukocytes onto vessel walls, decreased extravasation of leukocytes from the vessels into tissues, or an increase in number of precursor cells in the marrow.\n\n# Classification\nLeukocytosis can be subcategorized by the type of white blood cell that is increased in number. Leukocytosis in which neutrophil count is elevated is neutrophilia; leukocytosis in which lymphocyte count is elevated is lymphocytosis; leukocytosis in which monocyte count is elevated is monocytosis; and leukocytosis in which eosinophil count is elevated is eosinophilia.\nde:Leukozytose", "source": "wikidoc", "question": "According to authoritative guidelines, outline a structured clinical approach to evaluating an adult with leukocytosis (WBC ≥11.0 x 10^9/L), including how leukocytosis is defined and classified by cell type, the threshold and clinical significance of a leukemoid reaction, the common causes and underlying mechanisms to consider, how to distinguish a leukemoid reaction from leukemia or leukoerythroblastosis, and how leukocytosis should be interpreted in the assessment and management of acute infections such as pneumonia or tuberculosis."}
{"guideline_text": "Baconian method\nThe Baconian method is the investigative method developed by Francis Bacon.  It is an early forerunner of the scientific method. The method was put forward in Bacon's book Novum Organum, or 'New Instrument', and was supposed to replace the methods put forward in Aristotle's Organon.\n\n# Baconian Method\nThe Baconian method consists of procedures for isolating the form nature, or cause, of a phenomenon, including the method of agreement, method of difference, and method of concomitant variation.\nBacon suggests that you draw up a list of all things in which the phenomenon you are trying to explain occurs, as well as a list of things in which it does not occur. Then you rank your lists according to the degree in which the phenomenon occurs in each one. Then you should be able to deduce what factors match the occurrence of the phenomenon in one list and don't occur in the other list, and also what factors change in accordance with the way the data had been ranked. From this Bacon concludes you should be able to deduce by elimination and inductive reasoning what is the cause underlying the phenomenon.\nThus, if an army is successful when commanded by Essex, and not successful when not commanded by Essex: and when it is more or less successful according to the degree of involvement of Essex as its commander, then it is scientifically reasonable to say that being commanded by Essex is causally related to the army's success.\n\n# Idols of The Mind\nBacon also listed what he called the Idols of The Mind. He described these as things which obstructed the path of correct scientific reasoning.\n- Idols of the Tribe: This is humans' tendency to perceive more order and regularity in systems than truly exists, and is due to people following their preconceived ideas about things.\n- Idols of the Cave: This is due to individuals' personal weaknesses in reasoning due to particular personalities, likes and dislikes.\n- Idols of the Marketplace: This is due to confusions in the use of language and taking some words in science to have a different meaning than their common usage.\n- Idols of the Theatre: This is due to using philosophical systems which have incorporated mistaken methods. Here Bacon is referring to the influence of major philosophers (Aristotle) and major religions on science.\n\n# Followers\nThe English physician Sir Thomas Browne (1605-82) was one of the earliest scientists to adhere to  the scientific empiricism of the Baconian method. His encyclopaedia Pseudodoxia Epidemica (1646-76) includes numerous examples of  Baconian investigative methodology; its preface even paraphrases lines from Bacon's essay On Truth from his 1605 work The Advancement of Learning.\nThe Baconian method was further developed and promoted by English philosopher John Stuart Mill. His 1843 book, A System of Logic, was an effort to shed further light on issues of causation. In this work, he formulated the five principles of inductive reasoning now known as Mill's methods.", "source": "wikidoc", "question": "According to authoritative guidelines describing the Baconian method, discuss how you would apply the methods of agreement, difference and concomitant variation to identify the causal factor(s) in a hypothetical clinical outbreak, and how you would recognise and mitigate the four “Idols of the Mind” (Tribe, Cave, Marketplace, Theatre) during your investigation."}

{"guideline_text": "Romano–Ward syndrome\n\n# Overview\nRomano–Ward syndrome is the major variant of long QT syndrome. It is a condition that causes a disruption of the heart's normal rhythm. This disorder is a form of long QT syndrome, which is a heart condition that causes the cardiac muscle to take longer than usual to recharge between beats. If untreated, the irregular heartbeats can lead to fainting, seizures, or sudden death.\n\n# Inheritance\nRomano–Ward syndrome is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. It is the most common form of inherited long QT syndrome, affecting an estimated 1 in 5,000 people worldwide, although more people may be affected but never experience any signs or symptoms of the condition.\n\n# Causes\nMutations in the ANK2, KCNE1, KCNE2, KCNH2, KCNQ1, and SCN5A genes can cause Romano–Ward syndrome. The proteins made by most of these genes form channels that transport positively-charged ions, such as potassium and sodium, in and out of cells. In cardiac muscle, these ion channels play critical roles in maintaining the heart's normal rhythm. Mutations in any of these genes alter the structure or function of channels, which changes the flow of ions between cells. A disruption in ion transport alters the way the heart beats, leading to the abnormal heart rhythm characteristic of Romano–Ward syndrome.\nUnlike most genes related to Romano–Ward syndrome, the ANK2 gene does not produce an ion channel. The protein made by the ANK2 gene ensures that other proteins, particularly ion channels, are inserted into the cell membrane appropriately. A mutation in the ANK2 gene likely alters the flow of ions between cells in the heart, which disrupts the heart's normal rhythm and results in the features of Romano–Ward syndrome.\nThis article incorporates public domain text from The U.S. National Library of Medicine\n\n# Treatment\nAn imbalance between the right and left sides of the sympathetic nervous system may play a role in the etiology of this syndrome.  The imbalance can be temporarily abolished with a left stellate ganglion block, which shorten the QT interval.  If this is successful, surgical ganglionectomy can be performed as a permanent treatment.", "source": "wikidoc", "question": "According to authoritative guidelines, discuss how you would evaluate and manage a patient with Romano–Ward syndrome in whom a sympathetic imbalance is suspected, specifically addressing the rationale for using a left stellate ganglion block, the clinical indications and expected electrophysiologic response (including interpretation of QT shortening), how the block guides selection for permanent surgical left stellate ganglionectomy, and key considerations or limitations in proceeding to surgery."}

The statute's penal provisions are draconian by most nations' standards, providing for long terms of imprisonment, caning, and capital punishment. The law creates a presumption of trafficking for certain threshold amounts, e.g. 30 grams of cannabis. It also creates a presumption that a person possesses drugs if he possesses the keys to a premises containing the drugs, and that \"Any person found in or escaping from any place or premises which is proved or presumed to be used for the purpose of smoking or administering a controlled drug shall, until the contrary is proved, be presumed to have been smoking or administering a controlled drug in that place or premises.\" Thus, it is dangerous to even be in the company of drug users.

In KS associated with immunodeficiency or immunosuppression, treating the cause of the immune system dysfunction can slow or stop the progression of KS. In 40% or more of patients with AIDS-associated Kaposi's sarcoma, the Kaposi lesions will shrink upon first starting highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART).  However, in a certain percentage of such patients, Kaposi's sarcoma may again grow after a number of years on HAART, especially if HIV is not completely suppressed.

Surgery is generally not recommended as Kaposi's sarcoma can appear in wound edges.\n\n# Therapies\n- Local therapy:\nTopical treatment: This is the treatment to put medicine directly on the lesions.\nCryosurgery: During this procedure, the doctor use a probe cooled with liquid nitrogen to freeze the lesions.\nIntralesional chemotherapy: In this procedure, the chemotherapy drug is injected directly into the Kaposi's sarcoma lesions.\n- Topical treatment: This is the treatment to put medicine directly on the lesions.\n- Cryosurgery: During this procedure, the doctor use a probe cooled with liquid nitrogen to freeze the lesions.\n- Intralesional chemotherapy: In this procedure, the chemotherapy drug is injected directly into the Kaposi's sarcoma lesions.\n- Radiation therapy: This is a cancer treatment to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing by using high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation.\n- Chemotherapy: More widespread disease, or disease affecting internal organs, is generally treated with systemic therapy with interferon alpha, liposomal anthracyclines (such as Doxil) or paclitaxel.\n- Biologic therapy: This treatment uses chemicals such as interferon alpha to help the immune system attack cancer cells.\n\n# Antimicrobial Regimen\n- Human herpesvirus 8 (KSHV)\n- 1. Mild to moderate Kaposi sarcoma\n- Preferred regimen: initiate or optimize ART\n- 2. Advanced Kaposi sarcoma (ACTG Stage T1, including disseminated cutaneous or visceral Kaposi sarcoma)\n- Preferred regimen: chemotherapy (per oncology consult) AND ART\n- 3. Primary effusion lymphoma\n- Preferred regimen: chemotherapy (per oncology consult) AND ART\n- Note: Valganciclovir PO or Ganciclovir IV can be used as adjunctive therapy.\n- 4. Multicentric Castleman's disease\n- Preferred regimen (1): Valganciclovir 900 mg PO bid for 3 weeks\n- Preferred regimen (2): Ganciclovir 5 mg/kg IV q12h for 3 weeks\n- Preferred regimen (3): Valganciclovir 900 mg PO BID AND Zidovudine 600 mg PO q6h for 7–21 days\n- Alternative regimen: Rituximab 375 mg/m2 given weekly for 4–8 weeks (may be an alternative to or used adjunctively with antiviral therapy)\n- ↑ \"Guidelines for Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in HIV-Infected Adults and Adolescents\" (PDF)..mw-parser-output cite.citation{font-style:inherit}.mw-parser-output q{quotes:\"\\\"\"\"\\\"\"\"'\"\"'\"}.mw-parser-output code.cs1-code{color:inherit;background:inherit;border:inherit;padding:inherit}.mw-parser-output .cs1-lock-free a{background:url(\"\")no-repeat;background-position:right .1em center}.mw-parser-output .cs1-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .cs1-lock-registration a{background:url(\"\")no-repeat;background-position:right .1em center}.mw-parser-output .cs1-lock-subscription a{background:url(\"\")no-repeat;background-position:right .1em center}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration{color:#555}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription span,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration span{border-bottom:1px dotted;cursor:help}.mw-parser-output .cs1-hidden-error{display:none;font-size:100%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-visible-error{display:none;font-size:100%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration,.mw-parser-output .cs1-format{font-size:95%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-left,.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-wl-left{padding-left:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-right,.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-wl-right{padding-right:0.2em}", "source": "wikidoc", "question": "According to authoritative guidelines, outline a rational management plan for an adult patient newly diagnosed with Kaposi's sarcoma, explaining how treatment choices differ for (a) mild-to-moderate cutaneous disease, (b) advanced (ACTG T1) or visceral disease, and (c) associated conditions such as primary effusion lymphoma or multicentric Castleman's disease, including the roles of antiretroviral therapy, local therapies, systemic chemotherapy/biologic agents, and adjunctive antiviral regimens."}
{"guideline_text": "Drain (surgery)\nA surgical drain is a tube used to remove pus, blood or other fluids from a wound.  Drains inserted after surgery do not result in faster wound healing or prevent infection but are sometimes necessary to drain body fluid which may accumulate and in itself become a focus of infection. The routine use of drains for surgical procedures is diminishing. Better radiological investigation and confidence in surgical technique have reduced their necessity.  It is felt now that drains may hinder recovery by acting as an 'anchor' limiting mobility post surgery and the drain itself may allow infection into the wound. In certain situations their use is unavoidable.\nDrains may be hooked to wall suction, a portable suction device, or they may be left to drain by gravity.  Accurate recording of the volume of drainage as well as the contents is vital to ensure proper healing and monitor for excessive bleeding.  Depending on the amount of drainage, a patient may have the drain in place 1 day to weeks.  Signs of new infection or copious amounts of drainage should be reported to the health care provider immediately.  Drains will have protective dressings that will need to be changed daily/as needed.\n\n# Types of drains\n- Jackson-Pratt drain - This consists of a tube connected to a see through collection bulb.  The bulb has a drainage port which can be opened to remove fluid or air so that the bulb can be squeezed to create suction.  The drain should always stay below the area of the wound.\n- Penrose drain\n- Wound Vac System - Involves the use of enclosed foam and a suction device attached; this is one of the newer types of wound healing/drain devices which promotes faster tissue granulation, often used for large surgical/trauma/non-healing wounds.\n- Redivac drain\n- Pigtail drain - has an exterior screw to release the internal \"pigtail\" before it can be removed\n- Davol\n- Chest tube\n- Wound manager", "source": "wikidoc", "question": "According to authoritative guidelines, discuss the clinical indications for inserting a surgical drain after an operation, how the choice of drain type should be determined, and the key principles of postoperative management (including monitoring, documentation, dressing care, mobility considerations, and criteria for removal), with attention to potential harms and scenarios in which drains are unavoidable."}
